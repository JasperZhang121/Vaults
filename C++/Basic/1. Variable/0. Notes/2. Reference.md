Generally, the reference referred to is a left-value reference.

-   **Reference**: A reference is an alias for an object and a reference type refers to another type. For example, `int &refVal = val;`.
-   A reference must be initialized.
-   A reference and its initial value are **bound** together and not **copied**. Once defined, the binding cannot be changed to another object.

```C++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int val = 5;
    int &refVal = val; // refVal is a reference to val

    cout << "Value of val: " << val << endl;
    cout << "Reference value (refVal): " << refVal << endl;

    // changing the value of val through reference
    refVal = 10;
    cout << "Value of val after change: " << val << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

```Output
Value of val: 5
Reference value (refVal): 5
Value of val after change: 10
```
