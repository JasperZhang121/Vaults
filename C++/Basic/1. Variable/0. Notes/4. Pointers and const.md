- **Pointer to const**: Cannot be used to change the value of the object it points to. For example:
```Cpp
const double pi = 3.14;
const double *cptr = &pi;
```

Here, `cptr` is a pointer to `const`, which means we cannot modify the value of `pi` using `cptr`.


**Const pointer**: The pointer itself is a constant, which means the pointer always points to the same object (the address stored in the pointer cannot be changed), but the value of the object can be modified. For example:

```Cpp
int i = 0;
int *const ptr = &i;
```

Here, `ptr` is a constant pointer, which means it always points to the same object (`i`), but we can change the value of `i`.

### Top-level const

-   `Top-level const`: The pointer itself is a constant.
-   `Low-level const`: The object pointed to by the pointer is a constant. When copying, the same low-level const qualification is strictly required.
