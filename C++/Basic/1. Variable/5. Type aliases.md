Type aliases allow us to define a new name for an existing type. In C++, there are two ways to define type aliases: using the `typedef` keyword and the newer `alias declaration` syntax introduced in C++11.

Using the `typedef` keyword, we can define a synonym for a type, as follows:

```Cpp
typedef double wages;
wages hourly, weekly;  // equivalent to "double hourly, weekly;"
```

In C++11, we can use `alias declarations` to define type synonyms. This syntax is clearer than `typedef`, especially when defining more complex type aliases. For example:

```Cpp
using SI = Sales_item;
SI item;  // equivalent to "Sales_item item;"
```

In this example, `SI` is a synonym for the type `Sales_item`.
