## Simple Statements

-   **Expression Statement**: An expression followed by a semicolon makes it an expression statement.
-   **Null Statement**: A statement with only a semicolon.
-   **Compound Statement (Block)**: A sequence of statements and declarations enclosed in curly braces `{}`. A block introduces a new scope.

## Conditional Statements

-   **Dangling else**: A problem that arises in nested `if else` statements where it is unclear which `if` an `else` belongs to. C++ resolves this by matching the `else` with the nearest unmatched `if`.

## Iteration Statements

-   **while**: When the number of iterations is uncertain, a `while` loop is a good choice, such as when reading input.
-   **for**: The `for` statement allows you to omit the `init-statement`, the `condition`, or the `expression`, or even **all** of them.
-   **range-based for**: `for (declaration: expression) statement`

## Jump Statements

-   **break**: The `break` statement is used to terminate the nearest enclosing `while`, `do while`, `for`, or `switch` statement, and continue executing the first statement after them.
-   **continue**: Terminates the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop and immediately starts the next iteration. Can only be used inside a `while`, `do while`, or `for` loop.

## try Blocks and Exception Handling

-   **throw expression**: The exception handling part uses the `throw` expression to indicate that it has encountered a problem that it cannot handle. We say that `throw` raises an exception.
-   **try block**: Starts with the `try` keyword and ends with one or more `catch` clauses. Exceptions thrown by the code in a `try` block are typically caught and handled by one of the `catch` clauses. A `catch` clause is also known as an **exception handler**.
-   **exception classes**: Used to pass specific information about an exception between a `throw` expression and the corresponding `catch` clause.
