Expressions in C++ are made up of operators and operands. Some important concepts related to expressions include:

### Operand Conversions

In C++, small integer types can be promoted to larger integer types automatically. This is known as operand conversion.

### Operator Overloading

When an operator is used with class-type operands, the user can define what the operation should mean for that class.

### Lvalues and Rvalues

In C, lvalues are expressions that can be used on the left-hand side of an assignment, while rvalues cannot. In C++, the distinction is a bit different. When an object is used as an rvalue, its value is used (i.e. its contents). When it is used as an lvalue, its identity (i.e. its location in memory) is used.

### Evaluation Order

The order in which subexpressions within an expression are evaluated is not always defined. For example, in the expression `int i = f1() + f2()`, it is not guaranteed which of `f1()` or `f2()` will be evaluated first. If both functions modify the same object, this can lead to undefined behavior.
