## Exercise 4.1
>What is the value returned by 5 + 10 * 20/2?

```
105
```

## Exercise 4.2
>Using Table 4.12 (p. 166), parenthesize the following expressions to
indicate the order in which the operands are grouped: 

```cpp
*(vec.begin())
(*(vec.begin())) + 1
```

## Exercise 4.4
>Parenthesize the following expression to show how it is evaluated.
Test your answer by compiling the expression (without parentheses)
and printing its result.

```cpp
12 / 3 * 4 + 5 * 15 + 24 % 4 / 2
// parenthesize
((12/3)*4) + (5*15) + ((24%4)/2)
// 16 + 75 + 0 = 91
// print: 91
```

## Exercise 4.5
>Determine the result of the following expressions.

```cpp
-30 * 3 + 21 / 5  // -90+4 = -86
-30 + 3 * 21 / 5  // -30+63/5 = -30+12 = -18
30 / 3 * 21 % 5   // 10*21%5 = 210%5 = 0
-30 / 3 * 21 % 4  // -10*21%4 = -210%4 = -2
```
  
## Exercise 4.6
>Write an expression to determine whether an int value is even or odd.

```cpp
 i & 0x1
```
