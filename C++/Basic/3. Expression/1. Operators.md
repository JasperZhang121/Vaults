## Arithmetic Operators

-   **Overflow**: Overflow occurs when the result of a computation exceeds the range that can be represented by the type.
-   **bool types should not participate in arithmetic computations**.

```cpp
bool b=true;
bool b2=-b;   //still true
//b is true, and is promoted to int=1, -b=-1
//b2=-1â‰ 0, thus b2 remains true
```


-   Remainder operator m%n, result's sign is the same as m.


## Logical Operators

-   **Short-circuit Evaluation**: Both logical AND and OR operators first evaluate the left-hand operand and then the right-hand operand. The right-hand operand is evaluated only if the left-hand operand does not determine the result. **Evaluate left first, then right**.
-   Declaring a reference can avoid copying elements, which can save a lot of time, especially when the string is particularly large.

```cpp
vector<string> text;
for(const auto &s: text){
  cout<<s;
}
```

## Assignment Operators

-   The result of an assignment operation is its left-hand operand, and it is a lvalue. The type is the same as that of the left-hand object.
-   If the left and right operands of the assignment operator have different types, the right operand is converted to the type of the left operand.
-   The assignment operator satisfies **right-associative law**, which is different from other binary operators. `ival = jval = 0;` is equivalent to `ival = (jval = 0);`
-   The priority of the assignment operator is relatively low. When using it as a condition, parentheses should be added.
-   Compound assignment operators, the **compound operators evaluate the right-hand side expression only once**, whereas the regular operators evaluate it twice. (This has a slight impact on performance) Any compound operator op is equivalent to `a = a op b;`

## Increment and Decrement Operators

-   Prefix version `j = ++i`, add one first, then assign value
-   Suffix version `j = i++`, assign value first, then add one

**Prefix is preferred**, the postfix has an extra step to store the original value. (Unless the value before the change is needed)

### Mixing Dereference and Increment Operators

`*iter++` is equivalent to `*(iter++)`, and the increment operator has a higher priority.
