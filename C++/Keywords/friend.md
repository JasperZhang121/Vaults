A friend function is **a function that isn't a member of a class but has access to the class's private and protected members**.

```C++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
class A
{
public:
    A(int _a):a(_a){};
    friend int geta(A &ca);  // friend function
private:
    int a;
};

int geta(A &ca) 
{
    return ca.a;
}

int main()
{
    A a(3);    
    cout<<geta(a)<<endl;
    return 0;
}
```

A **friend class** can access private and protected members of other classes in which it is declared as a friend. It is sometimes useful to allow a particular class to access private and protected members of other classes. For example, a LinkedList class may be allowed to access private members of Node.

```C++
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

class A
{
public:
    A(int _a):a(_a){};
    friend class B;
private:
    int a;
};

class B
{
public:
    int getb(A ca) {
        return  ca.a; 
    };
};

int main() 
{
    A a(3);
    B b;
    cout<<b.getb(a)<<endl;
    return 0;
}
```
