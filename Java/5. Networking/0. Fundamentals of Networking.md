### Network protocols:

-   TCP/IP: Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol is a set of protocols for communication between devices over the internet. It is a reliable, connection-oriented protocol that provides guaranteed delivery of data packets. 

-   HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol is a protocol used for communication between web servers and web clients, such as web browsers. It is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web. 

-   FTP: File Transfer Protocol is a protocol used for transferring files over the internet.

### TCP/IP Server:

```java
import java.io.*;
import java.net.*;

public class TCPServer {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(1234);
        System.out.println("Server listening on port 1234...");

        while (true) {
            Socket clientSocket = serverSocket.accept();
            System.out.println("Connection from " + clientSocket.getInetAddress().getHostAddress());

            BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(clientSocket.getInputStream()));
            PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(clientSocket.getOutputStream(), true);

            String inputLine;
            while ((inputLine = in.readLine()) != null) {
                System.out.println("Received message from client: " + inputLine);
                out.println("Server received: " + inputLine);
            }

            in.close();
            out.close();
            clientSocket.close();
        }
    }
}
```

### TCP/IP Client:

```java
import java.io.*;
import java.net.*;

public class TCPClient {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        String serverHostname = "localhost";
        int serverPort = 1234;

        Socket socket = new Socket(serverHostname, serverPort);

        BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
        BufferedReader serverIn = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));
        PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(socket.getOutputStream(), true);

        String userInput;
        while ((userInput = in.readLine()) != null) {
            out.println(userInput);

            String serverResponse = serverIn.readLine();
            System.out.println("Server response: " + serverResponse);
        }

        in.close();
        serverIn.close();
        out.close();
        socket.close();
    }
}
```

In this example, the server listens on port 1234 for incoming client connections. When a client connects, the server reads incoming messages from the client and sends a response. The client connects to the server and sends messages to the server, and then waits for a response.

Note that in both the server and client code, we create a `Socket` object to establish a connection with the server or client. We also use `InputStream` and `OutputStream` objects to read and write data over the connection.
