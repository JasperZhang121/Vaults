1.  Class definition: A class is a blueprint for creating objects in Java. The syntax for defining a class is as follows:

``` java
public class MyClass {
  // class members
}
```

2.  Main method: The main method is the entry point for Java programs. It has the following syntax:

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
  // program statements
}
```

3.  Variables: Variables are used to store data in Java. The syntax for declaring variables is as follows:

```java
datatype variableName = value;
```

For example:

```java
int age = 30;
String name = "John";
```

4.  Methods: Methods are used to encapsulate a set of statements into a single unit that can be called from other parts of the program. The syntax for defining a method is as follows:

```java
accessModifier returnType methodName(parameters) {
  // method body
}
```

For example:

```java
public void printMessage(String message) {
  System.out.println(message);
}
```

5.  Control structures: Java has several control structures that are used to control the flow of a program. These include if-else statements, loops, and switch statements.

```java
if (condition) {
  // statements
} else {
  // statements
}

for (initialization; condition; update) {
  // statements
}

switch (variable) {
  case value1:
    // statements
    break;
  case value2:
    // statements
    break;
  default:
    // statements
}
```
