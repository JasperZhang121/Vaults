1. **Definition**: Distributed computing refers to the use of multiple computers or systems working together to solve a problem or perform a task. It involves <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">dividing the workload among multiple machines</mark> and coordinating their actions to achieve a common goal.
    
2. **Benefits**:
    
    - **Increased Performance**: Distributing the workload allows tasks to be completed faster by utilizing the combined processing power of multiple machines.
    - **Improved Scalability**: Distributed systems can easily scale up or down by adding or removing resources as needed, accommodating changing workloads.
    - **Enhanced Reliability**: Distributed computing can provide fault tolerance and redundancy by replicating data and tasks across multiple machines, reducing the risk of system failures.
    - **Geographical Flexibility**: Distributed systems can span multiple locations, allowing resources to be distributed geographically, enabling collaboration and providing disaster recovery capabilities.
3. **Key Concepts**:
    
    - **Parallel Processing**: The simultaneous execution of multiple <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">tasks or subtasks across different machines or processors</mark> to achieve higher performance.
    - **Message Passing**: Communication between different nodes or machines in a distributed system <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">using message passing protocols or communication libraries</mark>.
    - **Distributed File Systems**: <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">File systems</mark> designed to store and manage data across multiple machines, providing access transparency and fault tolerance.
    - **Distributed Coordination**: Mechanisms for <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">synchronizing and coordinating</mark> the actions of distributed components, ensuring consistency and correctness.
    - **Distributed Algorithms**: Algorithms designed to solve problems in a distributed environment, addressing challenges such as coordination, synchronization, and resource allocation.
4. **Challenges**:
    
    - **Concurrency and Synchronization**: Managing concurrent access to shared resources and ensuring consistency in a distributed system can be complex.
    - **Fault Tolerance**: Handling failures, both hardware and software, in a distributed environment while maintaining system availability.
    - **Data Consistency**: Ensuring that data remains consistent across multiple machines despite concurrent updates and network delays.
    - **Load Balancing**: Distributing the workload evenly among nodes to maximize resource utilization and avoid bottlenecks.
    - **Security**: Protecting data and ensuring secure communication across distributed systems, preventing unauthorized access and data breaches.
5. **Examples and Applications**:
    
    - **Distributed Computing Frameworks**: Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark, and Apache Flink are widely used frameworks for distributed data processing and analytics.
    - **Distributed Databases**: Systems like Apache Cassandra, MongoDB, and Google Spanner enable the storage and retrieval of large-scale data across multiple nodes.
    - **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)**: CDNs distribute content across multiple servers worldwide, improving the performance of delivering web content to end-users.
    - **Blockchain**: Blockchain technology uses distributed consensus algorithms to maintain a decentralized and secure ledger for cryptocurrencies and other applications.
    - **Internet of Things (IoT)**: IoT systems often rely on distributed computing to process and analyze data collected from numerous connected devices.
