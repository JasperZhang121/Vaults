1. Distributed Systems and Consensus:
    
    - Distributed systems consist of multiple nodes that communicate and collaborate to achieve a common goal.
    - Consensus is a fundamental problem in distributed systems, involving <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">reaching an agreement among nodes on a shared value or decision</mark>.
2. Consensus Algorithms:
    
    - Consensus algorithms are used to ensure that all nodes in a distributed system agree on a specific value, even in the presence of failures or network delays.
    - Some well-known consensus algorithms include Paxos, Raft, and Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT).
3. Paxos:
    
    - Paxos is a consensus algorithm that allows a distributed system to agree on a single value, even if some nodes fail or the network experiences delays or message loss.
    - It works by a proposer suggesting a value, which is then accepted by a majority of nodes through a series of communication rounds.
    - Paxos ensures safety (all correct nodes agree on the same value) and liveness (progress is made even in the presence of failures).
4. Raft:
    
    - Raft is another consensus algorithm designed for understandability and ease of implementation.
    - It divides the roles in a distributed system into three categories: leader, follower, and candidate.
    - The leader handles client requests, while followers replicate the leader's log and respond to client requests.
    - Raft uses leader election, log replication, and commit mechanisms to achieve consensus.
5. Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT):
    
    - Byzantine Fault Tolerance addresses the consensus problem in the presence of malicious or faulty nodes.
    - BFT algorithms ensure that correct nodes can agree on a value even if some nodes exhibit arbitrary and conflicting behaviors.
    - Examples of BFT algorithms include Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) and Tendermint.
6. Fault-Tolerant Replication:
    
    - Distributed systems often rely on fault-tolerant replication techniques to ensure consistency and availability.
    - Replication involves maintaining multiple copies of data across different nodes to tolerate failures.
    - Techniques like primary-backup replication and multi-version concurrency control (MVCC) ensure fault tolerance and data consistency.
7. Distributed Mutual Exclusion:
    
    - Distributed mutual exclusion ensures that only one node at a time can access a shared resource or execute a critical section of code.
    - Algorithms like the Lamport's distributed mutual exclusion algorithm and Ricart-Agrawala algorithm enable distributed processes to acquire exclusive access without conflicting with each other.
8. Distributed Snapshotting:
    
    - Distributed snapshotting algorithms allow the capture of consistent snapshots of the entire distributed system.
    - These algorithms ensure that all processes agree on the state of the system at a specific point in time, even while the system continues to operate.
9. Clock Synchronization:
    
    - Clock synchronization algorithms aim to align the clocks of distributed nodes to ensure a common notion of time.
    - Clock synchronization is crucial for coordinating events, ordering messages, and performing distributed computations accurately.
10. Consensus in Blockchain:
    
    - Consensus algorithms play a vital role in blockchain systems, enabling nodes to agree on a shared ledger state.
    - Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS), and Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) are commonly used consensus mechanisms in blockchain.
    - These mechanisms address the double-spending problem and ensure the integrity and security of the blockchain.
