1. Centralized Architecture:
    
    - In a centralized architecture, there is a single central node or server that acts as the authority and handles all the processing and data storage tasks.
    - <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Clients or user devices communicate with the central node to access resources and perform tasks</mark>.
    - The central node manages and controls all activities within the system.
    - This model simplifies management and coordination but can become a single point of failure and may limit scalability due to the reliance on a single node.
2. Decentralized Architecture:
    
    - Decentralized architectures distribute processing and data storage across multiple nodes without a central authority.
    - Nodes <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">communicate directly with each other</mark> and collaborate to achieve system goals.
    - Decision-making is distributed, and each node has some autonomy.
    - This model provides fault tolerance, as there is no single point of failure.
    - Examples of decentralized architectures include peer-to-peer networks and blockchain systems.
3. Client-Server Architecture:
    
    - The client-server architecture is a <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">widely used</mark> model in distributed systems.
    - It consists of clients that request services or resources and servers that provide those services.
    - <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Clients initiate requests, and servers respond accordingly</mark>.
    - Servers are responsible for managing and providing access to shared resources, while clients consume these resources.
    - This model allows for scalability, as additional servers can be added to handle increasing client demand.
    - Communication between clients and servers is typically based on request-response patterns.
4. Two-Tier Architecture:
    
    - Two-tier architecture divides the system into two layers: the <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">client layer and the server layer</mark>.
    - The client layer handles user interfaces and interactions, such as displaying information and capturing user input.
    - The server layer is responsible for data storage and processing.
    - Clients communicate directly with the server layer to access and manipulate data.
    - This architecture is commonly used in web applications, where the client layer is responsible for presenting information to users, and the server layer manages the business logic and data.
5. Three-Tier Architecture:
    
    - Three-tier architecture adds <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">an intermediate application layer between the client and server layers</mark>.
    - The client layer handles the user interface, allowing users to interact with the system.
    - The application layer contains the business logic and handles processing tasks.
    - The server layer manages data storage and retrieval.
    - Each layer has a distinct set of responsibilities and interacts with the adjacent layers using well-defined interfaces and protocols.
    - This architecture separates concerns, promotes modularity, and allows for scalability, as each layer can be scaled independently.
6. Hybrid Architectures:
    
    - Hybrid architectures combine different models and technologies to leverage their strengths and address specific requirements.
    - They may use a combination of centralized and decentralized components or a mix of cloud-based and on-premises resources.
    - Hybrid architectures aim to <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">achieve a balance between performance, scalability, fault tolerance, and cost-efficiency</mark>.
    - By combining the benefits of different architectures, hybrid models provide flexibility and adaptability to changing system demands and resource availability.
7. Event-Driven Architecture (EDA):
    
    - Event-driven architecture focuses on the flow of events or messages between components.
    - Events, which represent significant occurrences or changes in the system, are generated by different nodes or components.
    - Interested components or subscribers consume these events and react accordingly.
    - Event-driven architecture enables loose coupling, scalability, and responsiveness, making it suitable for real-time systems, Internet of Things (IoT), and event-driven applications.
    - Event-driven systems often use messaging systems, publish-subscribe patterns, or event streaming platforms to facilitate event communication.
8. Microservices Architecture:
    
    - Microservices architecture decomposes a system into a collection of small, independent services.
    - Each service focuses on a specific business capability and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
    - Services communicate with each other through lightweight protocols, such as REST or messaging.
    - This architecture promotes agility, scalability, and ease of maintenance by allowing teams to develop and deploy services independently.
    - Microservices architectures are commonly used in cloud-based systems, where services are deployed in containers or as serverless functions.
