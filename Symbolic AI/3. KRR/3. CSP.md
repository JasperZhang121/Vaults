A constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) is a computational problem that involves finding a solution to a set of constraints that restrict the possible values of variables in a problem domain. The goal of a CSP is to find a valid assignment of values to variables that satisfies all the constraints. CSPs are used in a variety of fields, such as artificial intelligence, operations research, and computer science. Some examples of CSPs include scheduling problems, routing problems, and puzzle-solving problems like Sudoku.
