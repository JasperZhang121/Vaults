A constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) is a computational problem that involves finding a solution to a set of constraints that restrict the possible values of variables in a problem domain. The goal of a CSP is to find a valid assignment of values to variables that satisfies all the constraints. CSPs are used in a variety of fields, such as artificial intelligence, operations research, and computer science. Some examples of CSPs include scheduling problems, routing problems, and puzzle-solving problems like Sudoku.

```python
function pureBacktracking(csp):
    return backtrack({}, csp)

function backtrack(assignment, csp):
    if assignment is complete:
        return assignment
    var = selectUnassignedVariable(csp, assignment)
    for value in orderDomainValues(var, assignment, csp):
        if isConsistent(var, value, assignment, csp):
            assignment[var] = value
            inferences = inference(var, value, assignment, csp)
            if inferences is not failure:
                assignment = assignment + inferences
                result = backtrack(assignment, csp)
                if result is not failure:
                    return result
            del assignment[var]
            undoInferences(inferences, assignment, csp)
    return failure
```
