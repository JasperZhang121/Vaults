### Quantifiers in first-order logic:

1.  <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Universal</mark> Instantiation (UI): If ∀x P(x) is true, then P(a) is true for any individual a in the domain of discourse.
    
2.  <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Existential</mark> Generalization (EG): If P(a) is true for some individual a in the domain of discourse, then ∃x P(x) is true.
    
3.  Universal Generalization (UG): If P(a) is true for any individual a in the domain of discourse, then ∀x P(x) is true.
    
4.  Existential Instantiation (EI): If ∃x P(x) is true, then we can introduce a new individual constant a and replace x with a in P(x) to obtain P(a).
    
5.  Quantifier Negation Rules:
    

-   ¬∀x P(x) is equivalent to ∃x ¬P(x)
-   ¬∃x P(x) is equivalent to ∀x ¬P(x)

6.  Quantifier Exchange Rule:

-   ∀x∃y P(x,y) is equivalent to ∃y∀x P(x,y)

7.  Skolemization: Eliminating existential quantifiers by introducing Skolem functions or constants.
    
8.  Quantifier Distribution: Distributing a quantifier over a conjunction or disjunction, using the following rules:
    

-   ∀x (P(x) ∧ Q(x)) is equivalent to (∀x P(x)) ∧ (∀x Q(x))
-   ∃x (P(x) ∧ Q(x)) is equivalent to (∃x P(x)) ∧ (∃x Q(x))
-   ∀x (P(x) ∨ Q(x)) is equivalent to (∀x P(x)) ∨ (∀x Q(x))
-   ∃x (P(x) ∨ Q(x)) is equivalent to (∃x P(x)) ∨ (∃x Q(x))
