Knowledge representation and reasoning (KRR) in Symbolic AI refers to the process of representing and manipulating knowledge in a way that is suitable for <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">automated reasoning</mark>. The goal of KRR is to create a formal representation of the world that can be used to reason about complex problems and make decisions.

Symbolic AI approaches KRR by representing knowledge using symbols, such as logical propositions or rules, and manipulating those symbols using logical inference rules to derive new knowledge. This allows for a more structured and systematic way of reasoning than other AI approaches, such as machine learning, which rely on statistical patterns in data.

Some common methods used in KRR include:

-   Propositional logic: a formal language for representing and manipulating logical propositions.
-   First-order logic: an extension of propositional logic that includes variables, quantifiers, and functions, allowing for more complex representations of knowledge.
-   Description logics: a family of logic-based knowledge representation languages that are particularly useful for representing knowledge about objects and their properties.
-   Rule-based systems: a way of representing knowledge in the form of production rules, which specify how to infer new knowledge from existing knowledge.

KRR has many applications in areas such as natural language processing, expert systems, and intelligent agents. By representing and reasoning about knowledge in a structured and systematic way, KRR provides a powerful tool for automated decision-making and problem-solving in complex domains.

# Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR)

- KRR is a subfield of AI that focuses on how <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">knowledge can be represented, manipulated, and used to reason about the world</mark>.

- The goal of KRR is to develop formalisms that enable knowledge to be expressed in a way that can be understood and processed by computers.

- KRR plays an important role in various AI applications, such as expert systems, natural language processing, and intelligent agents.

# SAT

- SAT stands for <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">propositional satisfiability</mark>, which is a classic problem in computer science that involves determining whether a given Boolean formula can be made true by assigning values to its variables.

- SAT is a central problem in many areas of computer science, including logic, complexity theory, and artificial intelligence.

- SAT solvers are widely used in many applications, such as software verification, automated planning, and electronic design automation.


### Example of using KRR and SAT in AI:

Consider a simple knowledge base about animals:

-   A dog is a mammal.
-   A cat is a mammal.
-   A bird is not a mammal.
-   A mammal has fur.

We can represent this <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">knowledge base</mark> using first-order logic and predicates. For example, we can define the following predicates:

-   mammal(x): x is a mammal
-   dog(x): x is a dog
-   cat(x): x is a cat
-   bird(x): x is a bird
-   fur(x): x has fur

Using these predicates, we can represent the knowledge base as follows:

-   ∀x (dog(x) → mammal(x))
-   ∀x (cat(x) → mammal(x))
-   ∀x (bird(x) → ¬mammal(x))
-   ∀x (mammal(x) → fur(x))

We can use a KRR system to reason about this knowledge base. For example, we can use inference rules to derive new knowledge. One inference rule is modus ponens, which states that if we know "p → q" and "p", then we can infer "q". Using modus ponens, we can infer that a dog has fur:

-   "dog(x) → mammal(x)" and "dog(fido)" imply "mammal(fido)"
-   "mammal(fido) → fur(fido)" implies "fur(fido)"

We can also use a SAT solver to check if a given statement is entailed by the knowledge base. For example, we can ask whether a bird has fur. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">To do this, we can negate the statement "bird(x) → fur(x)" and check if it is satisfiable. If it is unsatisfiable, then the statement is entailed by the knowledge base. If it is satisfiable, then the statement is not entailed by the knowledge base. In this case, negating the statement gives us "bird(x) ∧ ¬fur(x)", which is satisfiable</mark>. Therefore, we can conclude that a bird does not have fur.

### Conjunction Normal Form (CNF) 

is a form of propositional logic where a formula is expressed as a conjunction (AND) of one or more clauses, where each clause is a disjunction (OR) of one or more literals. A literal is either a propositional variable or its negation.

For example, the formula (p OR q) AND (NOT p OR r) AND (NOT q OR NOT r) is in CNF form, where each clause is a disjunction of literals and the whole formula is a conjunction of these clauses.

CNF is an important form of propositional logic because any propositional formula can be converted to an equivalent formula in CNF. This makes it useful for automated theorem proving, model checking, and other applications of propositional logic.
