DPLL stands for Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland, which is a well-known algorithm used for solving the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Boolean satisfiability problem</mark> (SAT). The SAT problem is the problem of determining whether a given Boolean formula can be satisfied by assigning true or false values to its variables.

The DPLL algorithm is a <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">backtracking search algorithm</mark> that works by iteratively simplifying the input formula until a satisfying assignment is found or it is determined that no such assignment exists. At each step, the algorithm selects a variable and assigns it a value (true or false) and then simplifies the formula by <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">removing clauses that are satisfied by that assignment, as well as any literals that are contradictory to that assignment</mark>. This process is repeated until the formula is reduced to either a single clause (which is trivially satisfiable) or an unsatisfiable formula, in which case the algorithm backtracks to the most recent decision point and tries a different assignment.

One of the strengths of the DPLL algorithm is its ability to take advantage of the structure of the input formula and to <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">use heuristics to guide the search</mark>. For example, it can use unit propagation, which identifies clauses with only one unassigned literal and assigns that literal a value, and pure literal elimination, which identifies literals that appear only with a single polarity in the formula and assigns them the corresponding value. These techniques can help to reduce the size of the search space and make the algorithm more efficient.

The DPLL algorithm is widely used in automated reasoning and is a key component of many SAT solvers, which are used in a variety of applications such as circuit design, verification, planning, and scheduling.

The general form of the DPLL algorithm is as follows:

1.  Input: A set of propositional clauses
2.  Initialize an empty assignment set
3.  Repeat until a satisfying assignment is found or it is proven that no such assignment exists:
    1.  If all clauses are satisfied by the current assignment, return the assignment
    2.  If there exists an unsatisfied clause that contains only one literal, assign the corresponding variable to the truth value that makes the clause true
    3.  If there exists an unsatisfied clause that contains only literals that are already assigned false, backtrack by undoing the last decision and assigning the opposite truth value to the variable
    4.  If neither of the above cases apply, select an unassigned variable and assign it to true
4.  Return "unsatisfiable"

Example:
```
(¬p ∨ ¬q ∨ r)
(p ∨ ¬r)
(¬p ∨ q ∨ r)
(¬r ∨ s)
```

1.  Initialize an empty assignment set
2.  Select `p` and assign it to `true`
3.  Simplify the clauses:
    -   `(¬p ∨ ¬q ∨ r)` becomes `(¬q ∨ r)`
    -   `(p ∨ ¬r)` becomes `(true)`
    -   `(¬p ∨ q ∨ r)` becomes `(q ∨ r)`
    -   `(¬r ∨ s)` remains unchanged
4.  Select `q` and assign it to `true`
5.  Simplify the clauses:
    -   `(¬q ∨ r)` becomes `(r)`
    -   `(q ∨ r)` becomes `(true)`
    -   `(¬r ∨ s)` remains unchanged
6.  All clauses are satisfied by the current assignment, so return `{p:true, q:true, r:true}` as the satisfying assignment.
