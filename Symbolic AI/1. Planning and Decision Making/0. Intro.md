Planning and decision-making are fundamental tasks in Artificial Intelligence, which involve selecting actions to achieve a desired goal or maximize some utility function. Planning involves reasoning about future events and determining the sequence of actions required to achieve a goal, while decision-making involves selecting the best action to take in a given situation.

### Planning in Symbolic AI

Planning in Symbolic AI involves representing the world in terms of logical propositions and reasoning about the effects of actions. A planner uses a domain model to determine the preconditions and effects of each action, and a search algorithm to find a sequence of actions that achieves the goal.

Some popular planning algorithms in Symbolic AI include:

-   **STRIPS** (Stanford Research Institute Problem Solver): a classical planner that uses a forward search to find a sequence of actions that achieves the goal.
-   **Graphplan**: a planner that uses a backward search and a graph-based representation of the planning problem to generate a plan.
-   **SATPLAN**: a planner that converts the planning problem into a propositional satisfiability problem and uses a SAT solver to find a plan.

### Decision Making in Symbolic AI

Decision-making in Symbolic AI involves representing the world in terms of logical propositions and reasoning about the expected outcomes of different actions. A decision maker uses a utility function to evaluate the desirability of different outcomes, and selects the action that maximizes the expected utility.

Some popular decision-making algorithms in Symbolic AI include:

-   **Value iteration**: an algorithm for finding the optimal policy for a Markov decision process (MDP) by iteratively computing the optimal value function.
-   **Policy iteration**: an algorithm for finding the optimal policy for an MDP by iteratively improving an initial policy.
-   **Q-learning**: a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that learns the optimal policy by estimating the Q-value function.

### Applications of Planning and Decision Making in Symbolic AI

Planning and decision-making algorithms have a wide range of applications in Symbolic AI, including:

-   Robotics: planning and decision-making algorithms are used to control the actions of robots and autonomous systems.
-   Logistics: planning algorithms are used to optimize the scheduling and routing of resources in transportation and supply chain management.
-   Game AI: decision-making algorithms are used to create intelligent agents in games and simulations.
-   Natural language processing: planning and decision-making algorithms are used to generate coherent and fluent natural language texts.
