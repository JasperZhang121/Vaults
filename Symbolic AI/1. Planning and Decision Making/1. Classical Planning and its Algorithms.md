Classical planning is a branch of AI concerned with developing agents that can make a sequence of decisions to achieve a goal. It involves constructing a plan, a sequence of actions that will achieve a particular goal or set of goals. The plan is executed in the environment, and the agent observes the resulting state of the environment and updates its plan accordingly.

## Problem Formulation

Classical planning is typically formulated as a search problem, where the goal is to find a sequence of actions that will transform the initial state into a goal state. The problem can be defined as a tuple (S, A, T, I, G), where:

-   S is a set of states
-   A is a set of actions
-   T is a transition function that maps a state and an action to a new state
-   I is the initial state
-   G is the set of goal states

## Planning Algorithms

### Forward Search

Forward search is a simple and intuitive planning algorithm. It starts with the initial state and generates successor states by applying available actions. If a successor state is a goal state, the planning process terminates. Otherwise, the algorithm continues the search from the successor state.

### Backward Search

Backward search is a planning algorithm that starts with the goal state and works backward to the initial state. It generates predecessor states by applying available actions and checks if the predecessor state is the initial state. If it is, the planning process terminates. Otherwise, the algorithm continues the search from the predecessor state.

### Heuristic Search

Heuristic search algorithms, such as A* and IDA*, use heuristic functions to guide the search process. The heuristic function estimates the cost of reaching a goal state from a given state. The search algorithm then chooses the state with the lowest estimated cost and expands it.

### Graphplan

Graphplan is a classical planning algorithm that uses a propositional logic representation of the planning problem. It constructs a planning graph that represents the set of all possible states and actions in the planning problem. The planning graph is then used to find a valid plan.

### STRIPS

STRIPS is an early and influential planning algorithm that uses first-order logic to represent the planning problem. It works by generating a set of subgoals that must be achieved to reach the goal state. These subgoals are then decomposed into a sequence of actions that can achieve them. The process continues until the goal state is achieved.
