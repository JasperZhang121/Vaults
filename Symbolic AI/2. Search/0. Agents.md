### PEAS:

To design a rational agent, we must specify the task environment

Consider, e.g., the task of designing a driverless taxi:

• Performance measure: – safety, destination, profits, legality, comfort, … 
• Environment: – streets/freeways, traffic, pedestrians, weather, … 
• Actuators: – steering, accelerator, brake, horn, blinkers, … 
• Sensors: – GPS, video, accelerometers, gauges, engine sensors, …

### Properties of Task Environments 

• Fully vs partially observable – do the agent sensors give access to all relevant information about the environment state? 
• Deterministic vs stochastic – is the next state completely determined by the current state and executed action? 
• Known vs unknown – does the agent know the environment’s laws of physics?
• Episodic vs sequential – is the next decision independent of the previous ones? • Static vs dynamic – can the environment change whilst the agent is deliberating? – Semi-dynamic:only the performance score changes. 
• Discrete vs continuous – can time, states, actions, percepts be represented in a discrete way? 
• Single vs multi-agent – is a single agent making decisions, or do multiple agents need to compete or cooperate to maximise interdependent performance measures? 5 Properties of Task Environments
