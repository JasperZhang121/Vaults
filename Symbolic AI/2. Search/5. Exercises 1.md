## Properties of search strategies:

### 1.
>Depth-fifirst graph search is guaranteed to return a shortest solution.

False: Depth-first provides no optimality guarantee at all. (It is only complete in finite search spaces).

### 2.
>Breadth-first graph search is guaranteed to return a <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">shortest</mark> solution.

True. This is because frontier nodes are ranked by increasing order of depth. (The strategy expands all nodes whose depth is less than the depth of the shallowest goal node).

### 3.
> Uniform-cost graph search is guaranteed to return an <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">optimal</mark> solution.

True: This is because frontier nodes are ranked by increasing order of g(n). (The strategy expands all nodes such that g(n) ≤ C ∗ , and some nodes such that g(n) = C ∗ including one single goal node.)

### 4.
> Greedy graph search is guaranteed to return an optimal solution.

False: This is because it completely ignores the cost to reach frontier nodes from the initial state, and only looks into the future estimated cost to the goal.

### 5.
> Breadth-fifirst graph search is a special case of uniform-cost search.

True: This is because breadth-fifirst search behaves like uniform-cost search when <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">all step costs are identical</mark>.

### 6.
>A* graph search with an admissible heuristic is guaranteed to return an optimal solution.

True: Note that this is only true of the version with node re-expansion. (Consistency is a stronger property than admissibility which does not require node re-expansion.)


### 7.
> A* graph search is guaranteed to expand no more nodes than depth-first graph search.

False: In dense solution spaces, depth-fifirst could fifind a solution much faster than A*.

### 8.
> A* graph search with a consistent heuristic is guaranteed to expand no more nodes than uniform-cost graph search.

True: this is because uniform-cost amounts to A* with h = 0 which is the most uninformed heuristic. Uniform cost completely ignores the future cost to reach a goal. An alternative way to see this is to observe that uniform cost expand all nodes such that g < C∗ whilst A* only expand all nodes such that g < C∗ − h (with h ≥ 0).

### Search strategies

Consider the search space below, where S is the initial state and G1 and G2 both satisfy the goal test. Arcs are labelled with the cost of traversing them and the estimated cost to a goal is reported inside nodes.

For each of the following search strategies: breadth-fifirst, depth-fifirst, iterative deepening, uniform cost, greedy search, and A*, indicate the path found (if any) by graph-search and list, in order, all the states expanded — recall that a state is expanded when it is removed from the frontier. Everything else being equal, nodes should be removed from the frontier in<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;"> alphabetical order</mark>. Assume that regardless of the strategy, the goal-test is performed when a node is dequeued from the fontier. For breadth-fifirst and depth-fifirst search, assume that newly generated nodes are not added to the frontier if they have already been explored or are on the frontier.

- Depth-fifirst: fifinds S → A → B → D → G2. Expanded nodes: S(0), A(1), B(2), D(3), G2(4)

- Iterative deepending: fifinds S → C → G2. Expanded nodes: S(0), S(0), A(1), C(1), S(0), A(1), B(2),E(2), C(1), D(2), G2(2)

- Uniform cost: fifinds S → C → D → G2. Expanded nodes: S(0), A(2), C(2), B(3), D(3), G2(6)
