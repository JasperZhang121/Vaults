> BFS

#### BFS-a
```
A -- B -- C
|         |
D -- E -- F
```

Starting from node A, use BFS to find the shortest path to node F.

1.  List the order in which the nodes are expanded (i.e., added to the queue).
    
2.  How many nodes are expanded in total?
    
3.  What is the shortest path from A to F?

Answers:

1. A,B,D,C,E,F
2. 6
3. A->B->C->F

#### BFS-b

Start at node A and use BFS to find the shortest path to node H in the following graph:

```
       B -- D -- F -- H
      / \    \      /
     /   \    \    /
    A     C    E  G
```

Can you tell me the order in which nodes are expanded and how many nodes are expanded in total?

Answers:

Expanded nodes: A,B,C,D,E,F,H
Total expanded: 7
Shortest path: A->B->D->F->H


> Uniform-cost search 

### UCS-a

Start at node S and use uniform-cost search to find the shortest path to node G in the following graph:

```
      S
     / \
    A   B
   /|   |\
  C D   E F
      \ | \
        H G
```

Can you tell me the order in which nodes are expanded and how many nodes are expanded in total? Also, what is the shortest path from S to G?

Answer:

Expanded order: S,A,B,C,D,E,F,H,G
Total expanded: 9
Shortest path: S->B->E->G


### UCS-b
