Using example from [[5. Exercises 1]]

Consider the search space below, where S is the initial state and G1 and G2 both satisfy the goal test. Arcs are labelled with the cost of traversing them and the estimated cost to a goal is reported inside nodes.

### BFS
Expanded nodes (layers show in bracket, "/" meaning expanding this node): 
S(0)/, A(1)/, C(1)/, B(2), E(2), D(2), G2(2) => found 

The BFS algorithm finds the shortest path in terms of the number of edges or levels in the graph, not necessarily the shortest path in terms of distance or cost. Therefore, it can be used to find the shortest path in a uniform cost graph where all edges have the same cost, but not in a graph where the edge costs vary.
