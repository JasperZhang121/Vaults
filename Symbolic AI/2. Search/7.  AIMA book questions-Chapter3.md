3.3 Suppose two friends live in different cities on a map, such as the Romania map shown in Figure 3.2. On every turn, we can simultaneously move each friend to a neighbouring city on the map. The amount of time needed to move from city i to neighbour j is equal to the road distance d(i, j) between the cities, but on each turn the friend that arrives first must wait until the other one arrives (and calls the first on his/her cell phone) before the next turn can begin. We want the two friends to meet as quickly as possible.

1.  Write a detailed formulation for this search problem. (You will find it helpful to define some formal notation here.)

```
State space: States are all possible city pairs (i, j). The map is not the state space. Successor function: The successors of (i, j) are all pairs (x, y) such that Adjacent(x, i) and Adjacent(y, j).  

Goal: Be at (i, i) for some i.  

Step cost function: The cost to go from (i, j) to (x, y) is max(d(i, x), d(j, y)). (because the friend that arrives first must wait until the other one arrives)
```

2.  Let D(i, j) be the straight-line distance between cities i and j. Which of the following heuristic functions are admissible? (i) D(i, j); (ii) 2 Â· D(i, j); (iii) D(i, j)/2.

```
1.  In the best case, the friends head straight for each other in steps of equal size, reducing their separation by twice the time cost on each step. Hence (iii) is admissible.
```

4.  Are there completely connected maps for which no solution exists?

5.  Are there maps in which all solutions require one friend to visit the same city twice?
