### Problem formulation:

the process of defining a problem, identifying the resources available to solve it, and determining the goals that need to be achieved. In artificial intelligence, problem formulation is a crucial step in designing an intelligent agent that can reason and act effectively in a given environment.

The problem formulation process involves several steps:

1.  Defining the problem: The first step is to define the problem that needs to be solved. This involves identifying the task, the environment, and the goals of the agent.
    
2.  Identifying the resources: The next step is to identify the resources available to the agent. This includes the sensors that can be used to observe the environment and the actuators that can be used to change it.
    
3.  Identifying the state space: The state space is the set of all possible states that the agent can be in. This includes the initial state of the agent and the possible states that it can transition to based on its actions.
    
4.  Defining the actions: The actions are the set of all possible actions that the agent can take. These actions are typically defined in terms of the available actuators.
    
5.  Defining the goal: The final step is to define the goal of the agent. This involves specifying the desired state or outcome that the agent should achieve.

Once the problem has been formulated, the agent can begin to reason and act to achieve its goals. The process of problem formulation is an iterative one, and the agent may need to refine its understanding of the problem and its resources as it interacts with the environment.
