- A strategy is defined by picking the order of node expansion. 
- This is the order used for the priority queue implementing the frontier. 
- Uninformed strategies use only the information available in the definition of the problem: 
	- Breadth-first search 
	- Uniform-cost search 
	- Depth-first search 
	- Depth-limited search 
	- Iterative deepening search
- Complete
	- the algorithm is guaranteed to find a solution (if one exists) for any valid input. 
	- In other words, the algorithm will always terminate with a solution (if there is one), and it will not run indefinitely or get stuck in an infinite loop. 
	- Completeness is an important property for algorithms, especially for problems where finding a solution is critical (e.g. safety-critical systems).

### BFS: [[Breadth First Search]]

Breadth First Search (BFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that starts at the root node and explores all the neighboring nodes at the current depth level before moving on to the next level. BFS visits nodes in breadth-first order, meaning that all the nodes at a particular depth level are visited before moving on to the next depth level.

BFS is used to find the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">shortest path</mark> between two nodes or to visit all the nodes in a graph, given that the graph is connected. The algorithm is implemented using a queue data structure to keep track of the nodes to be visited. (FIFO)

Here is the step-by-step process of BFS: 

1.  Initialize an <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">empty queue</mark> and enqueue the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">root node</mark>.
2.  Mark the <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">root node as visited</mark>.
3.  Dequeue the next node from the queue and examine its adjacent nodes.
4.  For each <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">adjacent node</mark> that has not been visited, <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">mark it as visited and enqueue it</mark>.
5.  Repeat steps 3-4 until the queue is empty.

BFS can be implemented using both iterative and recursive approaches, but the iterative approach is more commonly used because it is more efficient in terms of memory usage.

BFS has a <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">time complexity</mark> of O(V+E), where <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph</mark>. The space complexity is also O(V+E) because it requires a queue and a visited array to keep track of the visited nodes.

n terms of time complexity, Breadth First Search has a <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">time complexity</mark> of <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">𝑂(𝑏^(𝑑+1))</mark>, where <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">𝑏 is the maximum branching factor</mark> of the search tree, and <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">𝑑 is the depth</mark> of the goal node from the start node. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Complete</mark>: Yes (if <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">𝑏 and 𝑑 are finite</mark>)

In terms of space complexity, BFS stores all generated nodes in a queue until they are expanded, which can consume a lot of memory. Therefore, the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">space complexity</mark> of BFS is <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">𝑂(𝑏^(𝑑+1))</mark>.

BFS is optimal if the path cost is a non-decreasing function of the depth of the node because BFS always expands the shallowest unexpanded node first, so it is guaranteed to find the optimal solution.

In the case of BFS, the <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">time complexity and space complexity are often the same</mark>. This is because BFS explores the tree level-by-level, and at each level, it adds all the nodes to the queue before visiting any of their children.

In summary, the time complexity of BFS is exponential in the worst case, and its space complexity can be quite high as it needs to keep track of all the generated nodes. However, <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">BFS guarantees to find the optimal solution if it exists</mark>.

### Uniform-cost search ([[Dijkstra]])

Uniform-cost search is a search algorithm used for finding the shortest path in a <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">weighted graph</mark>. It is an informed search algorithm that uses a <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">priority queue</mark> to explore the search space. In uniform-cost search, the priority of each node is determined by the cost of the path from the start node to that node. The algorithm starts at the initial state and explores the search space by <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">repeatedly selecting the node with the lowest cumulative cost</mark>.

The algorithm maintains <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">a set of visited nodes and a priority queue of unvisited nodes</mark>. The priority queue is implemented as a min-heap. Initially, the <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">start node is added to the priority queue with a priority of zero</mark>. At each iteration, the algorithm selects the node with the <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">lowest priority</mark> from the priority queue and expands it. The algorithm stops when the goal node is expanded or the priority queue is empty.

Uniform-cost search guarantees to find the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">optimal solution</mark> if the cost function satisfies the following conditions:

-   non-negative: the cost of each action is non-negative
-   consistent: the cost of moving from one state to another state plus the estimated cost of reaching the goal state from the second state is always greater than or equal to the estimated cost of reaching the goal state from the first state.

Time and Space Complexity:

-   Time: 𝑂(𝑏^𝑑log(𝑏^𝑑)), where 𝑏 is the branching factor and 𝑑 is the depth of the shallowest goal node.
-   Space: 𝑂(𝑏^𝑑), since it needs to store all the nodes in the memory until the goal node is reached.

### Depth-first search ([[Depth First Search]])

a search algorithm that explores the deepest paths first before backtracking to less deep nodes. In other words, it starts at the root node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

1. Initialize a stack and add the starting node to it.
2. While the stack is not empty:
   a. Pop the top node from the stack.
   b. If the node has not been visited, mark it as visited and expand its children.
   c. Add the unvisited children to the stack.

DFS has the following properties:

-   Time complexity: O(b^m), where b is the branching factor and m is the maximum depth of the search tree.
-   Space complexity: O(bm), because it needs to store the nodes on the current path from the root to the current node.
-   Completeness: DFS is not complete if the search space contains infinite paths, because it will get stuck exploring an infinite path and never return to explore other parts of the search space.
-   Optimality: DFS is not optimal because it may find a non-optimal solution if it reaches a dead end before finding the optimal solution. However, if the search space is a tree and the goal node is at a shallow depth, DFS can be optimal.
