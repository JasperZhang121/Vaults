- A strategy is defined by picking the order of node expansion. 
- This is the order used for the priority queue implementing the frontier. 
- Uninformed strategies use only the information available in the definition of the problem: 
	-  Breadth-first search 
	- Uniform-cost search 
	- Depth-first search 
	- Depth-limited search 
	- Iterative deepening search

### BFS: [[Breadth First Search]]

Breadth First Search (BFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that starts at the root node and explores all the neighboring nodes at the current depth level before moving on to the next level. BFS visits nodes in breadth-first order, meaning that all the nodes at a particular depth level are visited before moving on to the next depth level.

BFS is used to find the shortest path between two nodes or to visit all the nodes in a graph, given that the graph is connected. The algorithm is implemented using a queue data structure to keep track of the nodes to be visited. (FIFO)

Here is the step-by-step process of BFS: 

1.  Initialize an empty queue and enqueue the root node.
2.  Mark the root node as visited.
3.  Dequeue the next node from the queue and examine its adjacent nodes.
4.  For each adjacent node that has not been visited, mark it as visited and enqueue it.
5.  Repeat steps 3-4 until the queue is empty.

BFS can be implemented using both iterative and recursive approaches, but the iterative approach is more commonly used because it is more efficient in terms of memory usage.

BFS has a time complexity of O(V+E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph. The space complexity is also O(V+E) because it requires a queue and a visited array to keep track of the visited nodes.
