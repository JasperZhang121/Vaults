> True/False

(a) There exists a task environment (PEAS) in which every agent is rational. 
	TRUE: e.g., let the performance measure be zero for every history. 
	A rational agent is one that takes action in order to <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">maximize its expected performance measure</mark>, given its current perceptual inputs and internal state. In other words, a rational agent is one that chooses the best action in each situation based on its knowledge and understanding of the environment.
	Now, consider an environment where <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">the performance measure is always zero</mark> for every history. In this case, every action taken by an agent will result in the same performance measure, which is zero. Therefore, any action that the agent takes will be optimal in terms of maximizing the performance measure. Since the agent is always taking the optimal action, it can be said that the agent is rational in this environment.

(b) Suppose agent A selects its action uniformly at random from the set of possible actions. There exists a deterministic, fully observable task environment in which A is rational. 
	TRUE: see (a). Many other environments have this property too. 

(c) No logical agent can behave rationally in partially observable environment. 
	FALSE: a logical agent can track the environment by inferring a description of the set of possible states, as in the wumpus world, and basing reflex rules on this description. 


(d) ∀ x, y: x = y is <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">satisfiable</mark>. 
	TRUE: satisfied by a model with exactly one object. 
	A formula is said to be satisfiable if there exists at least one interpretation or model under which the formula is true.


(e) If θ unifies the atomic sentences α and β, then α |= Subst(θ, β). 
	TRUE: If θ unifies α and β, then Subst(θ, β) ≡ Subst(θ, α), whcih is entailed by α for any θ. 
	
(f) In any finite state space, random-restart hillclimbing is an optimal algorithm. 
	TRUE (or maybe FALSE): it will eventually find the optimal solution, if necessary by generating it at random. But it has no way of knowing it has found the optimal solution, so strictly speaking it does not “return” it unless the time bound is finite—but in that case, it may not find it. The description in the book says that it returns the first goal it finds, which is obviously suboptimal; but one would not write the algorithm this way if optimal or near-optimal solutions were desired. We decided to give everyone full credit for this question.

>Search Suppose there are <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">two friends</mark> living in different cities on a map, such as the Romania map shown in Figure 3.2 of AIMA2e. On every turn, we can move each friend simultaneously to a neighboring city on the map. The amount of time needed to move from city i to neighbor j is equal to the road distance d(i, j) between the cities, but on each turn the friend that arrives first must <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">wait until the other one arrives</mark> (and calls the first on his/her cell phone) before the next turn can begin. We want the two friends <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">to meet</mark> as quickly as possible. Let us formulate this as a search problem.

(a) What is the state space? (You will find it helpful to define some formal notation here.) 
	States are all possible <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">city pairs (i, j)</mark>. The map is not the state space. 

(b) What is the successor function? 
	The successors of (i, j) are all pairs <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">(x, y) such that Adjacent(x,i) and Adjacent(y, j)</mark>. 

(c) What is the goal? 
	Be at (i,i) for some i. 

(d) What is the step cost function? 
	The cost to go from (i, j) to (x, y) is max(d(i, x), d(j, y)). 

(e) (6) Let SLD(i, j) be the straight-line distance between any two cities i and j. Which, if any, of the following heuristic functions are admissible? (If none, write NONE.) (i) SLD(i, j) (ii) 2 · SLD(i, j) (iii) SLD(i, j)/2 
	In the best case, the friends head straight for each other in steps of equal size, reducing their separation by twice the time cost on each step. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Hence (iii) is admissible</mark>. 
	The reason why heuristic function (i) SLD(i, j) may not be admissible is that it does not take into account the fact that the two friends are moving simultaneously towards each other, and that <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">the distance between them decreases as they move towards each other. This means that the actual distance that they will need to travel to meet is less than the straight-line distance between their starting points</mark>.

(f) There are completely connected maps for which no solution exists. 
	TRUE: e.g., a map with two nodes connected by one link.

> Give a complete problem formulation for each of the following. Choose a formulation that is precise enough to be implemented.

(b) A 3-foot-tall monkey is in a room where some bananas are suspended from the 8-foot ceiling. He would like to get the bananas. The room contains two stackable, movable, climbable 3-foot-high crates.
-  Goal test: Monkey has bananas.  
- Successor function: Hop on crate; Hop off crate; Push crate from one spot to another; Walk from one spot to another; grab bananas (if standing on crate). 
- Cost function: Number of actions.

(c) You have a program that outputs the message “illegal input record” when fed a certain file of input records. You know that processing of each record is independent of the other records. You want to discover what record is illegal.

- Goal test: considering a single record, and it gives “illegal input” message.  
- Successor function: run again on the first half of the records; run again on the second half of the records.  
- Cost function: Number of runs.  

we can start by <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">dividing the file into two equal parts and processing the middle record</mark>. If the program outputs the message "illegal input record" for that record, we know that the illegal record must be in the first half of the file, so we <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">repeat the process</mark> on that half. If the program outputs the message for the middle record of the second half, we know that the illegal record must be in the second half, so we repeat the process on that half. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">We continue this process of dividing the remaining portion of the file in half and processing the middle record until we have identified the illegal record.</mark>

Note: This is a contingency problem; you need to see whether a run gives an error message or not to decide what to do next.

>Consider the problem of finding the shortest path between two points on a plane that has convex polygonal obstacles as shown in Figure 3.31. This is an idealization of the problem that a robot has to solve to navigate in a crowded environment.

(a)  Suppose the state space consists of <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">all positions (x, y)</mark> in the plane. How many states are there? How many paths are there to the goal?
	If we consider all (x, y) points, then there are an infinite number of states, and of paths.

(b) Explain briefly why the shortest path from one polygon vertex to any other in the scene must consist of straight-line segments joining some of the vertices of the polygons. Define a good state space now. How large is this state space?

(For this problem, we consider the start and goal points to be vertices.) The shortest distance between two points is a straight line, and if it is not possible to travel in a straight line because some obstacle is in the way, then the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">next shortest distance is a sequence of line segments, end-to-end, that deviate from the straight line by as little as possible</mark>. So the first segment of this sequence must go from the start point to a tangent point on an obstacle – any path that gave the obstacle a wider girth would be longer. Because the obstacles are polygonal, the tangent points must be at vertices of the obstacles, and hence the entire path must go from vertex to vertex. So now the state space is the set of vertices, of which there are 35 in Figure 3.31.

>The missionaries and cannibals problem is usually stated as follows. <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Three mission- aries and three cannibals</mark> are on one side of a river, along with a boat that can hold one or two people. Find a way to get everyone to the other side without ever leaving a group of mis- sionaries in one place outnumbered by the cannibals in that place. This problem is famous in AI because it was the subject of the first paper that approached problem formulation from an analytical viewpoint (Amarel, 1968).

(a) Formulate the problem precisely, making only those distinctions necessary to ensure a valid solution. Draw a diagram of the complete state space.

Here is one possible representation: A state is a six-tuple of integers listing the number of missionaries, cannibals, and boats on the first side, and then the second side of the river. The goal is a state with 3 missionaries and 3 cannibals on the second side. The cost function is one per action, and the successors of a state are all the states that move 1 or 2 people and 1 boat from one side to another.

(c) Why do you think people have a hard time solving this puzzle, given that the state space is so simple?

It is not obvious that almost all moves are either illegal or revert to the previous state. There is a feeling of a large branching factor, and no clear way to proceed.

>Define in your own words the following terms: state, state space, search tree, search node, goal, action, transition model, and branching factor.

<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">A state is a situation that an agent can find itself in</mark>. We distinguish two types of states: world states (the actual concrete situations in the real world) and representational states (the abstract descriptions of the real world that are used by the agent in deliberating about what to do).

A <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">state space</mark> is <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">a graph whose nodes are the set of all states</mark>, and whose links are actions that transform one state into another.

A <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">search tree</mark> is a tree (a graph with no undirected loops) in which the root node is the start state and the set of children for each node consists of the states reachable by taking any action.

A search node is a node in the search tree. 
A goal is a state that the agent is trying to reach. 
An action is something that the agent can choose to do.  
A successor function described the agent’s options: <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">given a state, it returns a set of (action, state) pairs</mark>, where each state is the state reachable by taking the action. The <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">branching factor</mark> in a search tree is the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">number of actions</mark> available to the agent.


### 7.
>What’s the difference between a world state, a state description, and a search node? Why is this distinction useful?

A <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">world state is how reality is or could be</mark>. In one world state we’re in Arad, in another we’re in Bucharest. The world state also includes which street we’re on, what’s currently on the radio, and the price of tea in China. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">A state description is an agent’s internal description of a world state</mark>. Examples are In(Arad) and In(Bucharest). These descriptions are necessarily approximate, recording only some aspect of the state.

We need to distinguish between world states and state descriptions because <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">state description are lossy abstractions of the world state</mark>, because the agent could be mistaken about how the world is, because the agent might want to imagine things that aren’t true but it could make true, and because the agent cares about the world not its internal representation of it.

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Search nodes are generated during search</mark>, representing a state the search process knows how to reach. They contain additional information aside from the state description, such as the sequence of actions used to reach this state. This distinction is useful because we may generate different search nodes which have the same state, and because search nodes contain more information than a state representation.

>Prove that GRAPH-SEARCH satisfies the graph separation property illustrated in Fig- ure 3.9. (Hint: Begin by showing that the property holds at the start, then show that if it holds before an iteration of the algorithm, it holds afterwards.) Describe a search algorithm that violates the property.

The graph separation property states that “every path from the initial state to an unex- plored state has to pass through a state in the frontier.”

At the start of the search, the frontier holds the initial state; hence, trivially, every path from the initial state to an unexplored state includes a node in the frontier (the initial state itself).

Now, we assume that the property holds at the beginning of an arbitrary iteration of the GRAPH-SEARCH algorithm in Figure 3.7. We assume that the iteration completes, i.e., the frontier is not empty and the selected leaf node n is not a goal state. At the end of the iteration, n has been removed from the frontier and its successors (if not already explored or in the frontier) placed in the frontier. Consider any path from the initial state to an unexplored state; by the induction hypothesis such a path (at the beginning of the iteration) includes at least one frontier node; except when n is the only such node, the separation property automatically holds. Hence, we focus on paths passing through n (and no other frontier node). By definition, the next node n′ along the path from n must be a successor of n that (by the preceding sentence) is already not in the frontier. Furthermore, n′ cannot be in the explored set, since by assumption there is a path from n′ to an unexplored node not passing through the frontier, which would violate the separation property as every explored node is connected to the initial state by explored nodes (see lemma below for proof this is always possible). Hence, n′ is not in the explored set, hence it will be added to the frontier; then the path will include a frontier node and the separation property is restored.

The property is violated by algorithms that move nodes from the frontier into the ex-plored set before all of their successors have been generated, as well as by those that fail to add some of the successors to the frontier. Note that it is not necessary to generate all suc- cessors of a node at once before expanding another node, as long as partially expanded nodes remain in the frontier.

Lemma: Every explored node is connected to the initial state by a path of explored nodes.

Proof: This is true initially, since the initial state is connected to itself. Since we never remove nodes from the explored region, we only need to check new nodes we add to the explored list on an expansion. Let n be such a new explored node. This is previously on the frontier, so it is a neighbor of a node n′ previously explored (i.e., its parent). n′ is, by hypothesis is connected to the initial state by a path of explored nodes. This path with n appended is a path of explored nodes connecting n′ to the initial state.

>Which of the following are true and which are false? Explain your answers.

(a) Depth-first search always expands at least as many nodes as A∗ search with an admissible heuristic.
	False: a lucky DFS might expand exactly d nodes to reach the goal. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">A∗ largely dominates any graph-search algorithm that is guaranteed to find optimal solutions</mark>.

(b) h(n) = 0 is an admissible heuristic for the 8-puzzle. 
	True: h(n) = 0 is always an admissible heuristic, since costs are nonnegative.
	
(c) A∗ is of no use in robotics because percepts, states, and actions are continuous.
	True: A* search is often used in robotics; <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">the space can be discretized or skeletonized</mark>.

(d) Breadth-first search is complete even if zero step costs are allowed.
	True: depth of the solution matters for breadth-first search, not cost.

(e) Assume that a rook can move on a chessboard any number of squares in a straight line, vertically or horizontally, but cannot jump over other pieces. Manhattan distance is an admissible heuristic for the problem of moving the rook from square A to square B in the smallest number of moves.
	False: a rook can move across the board in move one, although the Manhattan distance from start to finish is 8.
