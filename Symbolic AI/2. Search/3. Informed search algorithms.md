**Evaluation function:**
- Evaluation function f (n) = g(n) + h(n)  
-  estimate of “desirability”, usually problem-specific.  
- g(n) = cost so far to reach n  
- h(n) = estimated cost from n to the closest goal (heuristic) 
- f (n) = estimated total cost of path through n to goal
-> The lower f (n), the more desirable n is

### Greedy Search

• Evaluation function f (n) = h(n) (entirely heuristic) = estimate of cost from n to the closest goal
• E.g., hSLD(n) = straight-line distance from n to goal
• Greedy search expands the node that appears to be closest to goal

**Properties:**
-   Complete: No. It can get stuck in loops
    -   Complete in finite space with repeated-state checking
-   Time: O(b^m), but a good heuristic can give dramatic improvement
-   Space: O(b^m)
-   Optimal: No
