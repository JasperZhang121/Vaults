- Adversarial search problems involve two or more agents competing against each other.

- The agents take turns making moves, and each agent tries to maximize their own utility or minimize their opponent's utility.

- Adversarial search problems are often used in games like chess, checkers, and Go, but can also be applied in other domains like cybersecurity.

- The minimax algorithm is a popular algorithm used for solving adversarial search problems. It assumes that both players play optimally and tries to minimize the maximum possible loss.

- The minimax algorithm can be improved by using alpha-beta pruning, which is a technique for reducing the number of nodes explored in the search tree.

- Adversarial search problems with incomplete information are more difficult to solve, as the agents do not have complete information about the state of the game.

- Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is a popular algorithm used for solving adversarial search problems with incomplete information. It works by repeatedly simulating games and using the results to guide the search towards more promising moves.

- MCTS has been successfully applied in games like poker and Go, where the state of the game is not fully observable.
