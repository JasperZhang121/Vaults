- Adversarial search problems involve two or more agents competing against each other.

- The agents take turns making moves, and each agent tries to maximize their own utility or minimize their opponent's utility.

- Adversarial search problems are often used in games like chess, checkers, and Go, but can also be applied in other domains like cybersecurity.

- The minimax algorithm is a popular algorithm used for solving adversarial search problems. It assumes that both players play optimally and tries to minimize the maximum possible loss.

- The minimax algorithm can be improved by using alpha-beta pruning, which is a technique for reducing the number of nodes explored in the search tree.

- Adversarial search problems with incomplete information are more difficult to solve, as the agents do not have complete information about the state of the game.

- Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is a popular algorithm used for solving adversarial search problems with incomplete information. It works by repeatedly simulating games and using the results to guide the search towards more promising moves.

- MCTS has been successfully applied in games like poker and Go, where the state of the game is not fully observable.

### A game in AI can be represented as a tuple (S, A, P, R, O, T), where:

-   S is the set of all possible game states
-   A is the set of all possible actions that can be taken in each state
-   P: S × A → S is a transition function that takes a state and an action and returns the resulting state
-   R: S × A × S → ℤ is a reward function that takes a state, an action, and a resulting state and returns a numeric reward
-   O is the set of all possible outcomes of the game (e.g., win, lose, draw)
-   T is a function that maps each outcome in O to the corresponding terminal states in S

In addition, a game in AI is often assumed to be:

-   deterministic: the next state is fully determined by the current state and action
-   turn-taking: each player takes turns making a move
-   two-player: there are only two players
-   zero-sum: the total reward for one player is equal and opposite to the total reward for the other player
-   of perfect information: all players have complete knowledge of the game state at all times.
