## Properties of search strategies:

### 1.
>Depth-first graph search is guaranteed to return a shortest solution.

False: Depth-first provides no optimality guarantee at all. (It is only complete in finite search spaces).

### 2.
>Breadth-first graph search is guaranteed to return a <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">shortest</mark> solution.

True. This is because frontier nodes are ranked by increasing order of depth. (The strategy expands all nodes whose depth is less than the depth of the shallowest goal node).

### 3.
> Uniform-cost graph search is guaranteed to return an <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">optimal</mark> solution.

True: This is because frontier nodes are ranked by increasing order of g(n). (The strategy expands all nodes such that g(n) ≤ C ∗ , and some nodes such that g(n) = C ∗ including one single goal node.)

### 4.
> Greedy graph search is guaranteed to return an optimal solution.

False: This is because it completely ignores the cost to reach frontier nodes from the initial state, and only looks into the future estimated cost to the goal.

### 5.
> Breadth-first graph search is a special case of uniform-cost search.

True: This is because breadth-first search behaves like uniform-cost search when <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">all step costs are identical</mark>.

### 6.
>A* graph search with an admissible heuristic is guaranteed to return an optimal solution.

True: Note that this is only true of the version with node re-expansion. (Consistency is a stronger property than admissibility which does not require node re-expansion.)


### 7.
> A* graph search is guaranteed to expand no more nodes than depth-first graph search.

False: In dense solution spaces, depth-first could find a solution much faster than A*.

### 8.
> A* graph search with a consistent heuristic is guaranteed to expand no more nodes than uniform-cost graph search.

True: this is because uniform-cost amounts to A* with h = 0 which is the most uninformed heuristic. Uniform cost completely ignores the future cost to reach a goal. An alternative way to see this is to observe that uniform cost expand all nodes such that g < C∗ whilst A* only expand all nodes such that g < C∗ − h (with h ≥ 0).

### Search strategies

Consider the search space below, where S is the initial state and G1 and G2 both satisfy the goal test. Arcs are labelled with the cost of traversing them and the estimated cost to a goal is reported inside nodes.

For each of the following search strategies: breadth-first, depth-first, iterative deepening, uniform cost, greedy search, and A*, indicate the path found (if any) by graph-search and list, in order, all the states expanded — recall that a state is expanded when it is removed from the frontier. Everything else being equal, nodes should be removed from the frontier in<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;"> alphabetical order</mark>. Assume that regardless of the strategy, the goal-test is performed when a node is dequeued from the frontier. For breadth-first and depth-first search, assume that newly generated nodes are not added to the frontier if they have already been explored or are on the frontier.

- Breadth-first: finds S → C → G2. Expanded nodes: S(0), A(1), C(1), B(2), D(2), E(2), G2(2)

- Depth-first: finds S → A → B → D → G2. Expanded nodes: S(0), A(1), B(2), D(3), G2(4)

- Iterative deepening: finds S → C → G2. Expanded nodes: S(0), S(0), A(1), C(1), S(0), A(1), B(2),E(2), C(1), D(2), G2(2)

- Uniform cost: finds S → C → D → G2. Expanded nodes: S(0), A(2), C(2), B(3), D(3), G2(6)

- Greedy: ﬁnds S→A→B→G1. Expanded nodes: S(5),A(2),B(1),G1(0)

- A star finds S → C → D → G2. Expanded nodes: S(0+5=5), A(2+2=4), B(3+1=4), D(4+1=5), C(2+4=6), D(3+1=4), G2(6+0=6)

### Graph Search algorithm

List all the issues in the following implementation of Graph Search, and explain their impact on completeness and optimality of the various strategies.

```scala

function Graph-Search(problem, frontier)
    explored = new Set()
    frontier = Insert(Make-Node(Initial-State[problem]), frontier)

    while true
        if frontier is empty
            return failure

        node = Remove-Front(frontier)

        if Goal-Test(problem, State[node])
            return node

        frontier = InsertNodes(Expand(node, problem), frontier)


function InsertNodes(nodes, frontier)
    for n in nodes
        add n to frontier

        for m in explored ∪ frontier
            if State[m] = State[n]
                Path-Cost[m] = Path-Cost[n]
                Parent[m] = Parent[n]
                Action[m] = Action[n]
                Depth[m] = Depth[n]
    return frontier
```

There are four issues with the above implementation.
1. In the Graph-Search function, nodes that do not match the goal-test should be added to the<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;"> explored list</mark>. Otherwise, nodes labelled by the same state will be expanded multiple times, as in tree-search. For strategies such as depth-first search or greedy search, this can lead to incompleteness when there are loops in the search space.
2. One of the main principles of Graph Search is that at most one node labelled by a given state is on the frontier or the explored list at any one time. At the beginning of the InsertNodes function, successor node n should not systematically be added to the frontier. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">A node n should only be added at that point if no node m on the frontier or in the explored list is labelled by the same state as n</mark>. Otherwise we could compromise both optimality and completeness.
3. When a node m, is found on the frontier or in the explored list that is labelled by the same state as n, the various fields of m should only <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">be updated if n represents a better path to that state, that is if</mark> g(n) < g(m) . Otherwise again optimality is compromised with strategies such as A* and even with uniform cost search.
4. Even if the above problems are fixed, the algorithm will only return the optimal solution if the heuristic is consistent. If the heuristic is only admissible then a node on the explored list should be re-opened when a better path to the state labelling that node is found. With a consistent heuristic, that case cannot happen because the first path to a state that is found (and which is put on the explored list) is the shortest path to that state.
