ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) is a statistical method used to test the differences among means of two or more groups. It is used to determine whether there is a significant variation between the group means or if the differences between groups can be attributed to random chance. The ANOVA test can be one-way or two-way, depending on the number of independent variables being analyzed.

One-way ANOVA is used when there is only one independent variable (factor), and the dependent variable is continuous. Two-way ANOVA is used when there are two independent variables (factors), and the dependent variable is continuous. In both cases, ANOVA tests the null hypothesis that all group means are equal against the alternative hypothesis that at least one group mean is different.
