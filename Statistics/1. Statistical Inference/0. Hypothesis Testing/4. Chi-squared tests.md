Chi-squared tests are a family of statistical tests used to evaluate the association between two categorical variables. The test is called a chi-squared test because the test statistic follows a chi-squared distribution. There are three main types of chi-squared tests:

1.  Goodness-of-fit test: It is used to determine whether an observed frequency distribution fits a theoretical distribution. The test compares the observed frequencies with the expected frequencies to evaluate whether they are significantly different. This test is commonly used in quality control to test whether the output of a process conforms to a specified distribution.
    
2.  Test of independence: It is used to determine whether there is a significant association between two categorical variables. The test measures whether the frequency distribution of one variable is related to the frequency distribution of the other variable. For example, a researcher might want to test whether there is a significant relationship between gender and political party affiliation.
    
3.  Test of homogeneity: It is used to determine whether there is a significant difference between the proportions of different categories in two or more groups. The test is similar to the test of independence, but it is used when the variables being compared are measured on the same group of subjects. For example, a researcher might want to test whether there is a significant difference in the proportion of smokers among different age groups.
