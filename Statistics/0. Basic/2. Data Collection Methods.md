Data collection is the process of gathering information from various sources. In statistics, data collection methods are divided into two categories: sampling methods and data collection methods.

## Sampling Methods

Sampling methods are used to collect data from a subset of a population. The following are some of the commonly used sampling methods:

1.  Simple Random Sampling: It is a method of selecting a random sample from a population, where each member has an equal chance of being selected.
    
2.  Stratified Sampling: This method involves dividing the population into subgroups or strata and then selecting a random sample from each stratum.
    
3.  Cluster Sampling: In this method, the population is divided into clusters, and a random sample of clusters is selected. All members of the selected clusters are included in the sample.
    
4.  Systematic Sampling: This method involves selecting a random starting point and then selecting every nth member of the population.
    

## Data Collection Methods

Data collection methods are divided into two categories:

1.  Surveys: Surveys are used to collect data from a sample of the population. Surveys can be conducted through various methods, such as online surveys, phone interviews, or in-person interviews.
    
2.  Experiments and Observational Studies: These methods are used to collect data from a population. Experiments are conducted by manipulating one or more variables to see how they affect the outcome. Observational studies involve observing and recording data without manipulating any variables.
