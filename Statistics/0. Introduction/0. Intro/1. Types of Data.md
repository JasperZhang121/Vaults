In statistics, data can be broadly classified into two types:

### 1. Categorical Data

Categorical data represents descriptive information that cannot be measured or counted but can be categorized based on a particular characteristic. It is also known as qualitative data.

Examples:

-   Gender (male/female)
-   Marital status (married/single/divorced)
-   Type of car (SUV/sedan/hatchback)

Categorical data can be further classified as nominal or ordinal data.

#### Nominal Data

Nominal data consists of categories that do not have an inherent order or ranking.

Examples:

-   Colors (red/blue/green/yellow)
-   Types of fruit (apple/banana/mango)
-   Country of birth (USA/UK/Canada)

#### Ordinal Data

Ordinal data consists of categories that can be ranked or ordered based on some criteria.

Examples:

-   Education level (high school/associate's degree/bachelor's degree/master's degree/doctorate)
-   Income level (low/middle/high)
-   Satisfaction level (poor/fair/good/excellent)


### 2. Numerical Data

Numerical data represents quantitative information that can be measured or counted. It is also known as quantitative data.

Examples:

-   Age (in years)
-   Weight (in pounds)
-   Temperature (in degrees Celsius)

Numerical data can be further classified as discrete or continuous data.

#### Discrete Data

Discrete data consists of finite or countable values.

Examples:

-   Number of children in a family (1, 2, 3, ...)
-   Number of goals scored in a soccer match (0, 1, 2, ...)

#### Continuous Data

Continuous data consists of an infinite number of possible values within a certain range.

Examples:

-   Height (in inches)
-   Time taken to complete a task (in seconds)
-   Amount of rainfall (in inches)
