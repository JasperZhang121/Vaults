The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is a fundamental concept in statistics that describes the behavior of sample means when the sample size is sufficiently large. It states that regardless of the underlying population distribution, the distribution of sample means approximates a normal distribution.

The CLT is important because it allows us to make inferences about a population based on a sample, even when we don't know the underlying population distribution. The theorem applies to any population distribution, including skewed or heavy-tailed distributions.

The CLT has three main components:

1.  **Random Sampling**: The sample must be chosen randomly from the population, without any bias or influence.
    
2.  **Sample Size**: The sample size should be sufficiently large (typically n â‰¥ 30) to ensure that the sample means follow a normal distribution.
    
3.  **Independence**: The sample observations must be independent of each other.
    

The CLT has important implications for statistical inference, hypothesis testing, and confidence intervals. It allows us to use the normal distribution to make probabilistic statements about the population mean and to test hypotheses about population parameters.
