A probability density function (PDF) is a function that describes the relative likelihood for a continuous random variable to take on a given value. The PDF is often denoted by f(x), where x is the random variable, and integrates to 1 over the range of possible values of x.

More specifically, the probability density function of a continuous random variable X is a function f(x) such that for any two values a and b, where a < b:

$P(a < X < b) = ∫ a to b f(x) dx$

where the integral symbol (∫) represents the area under the curve of the function f(x) between a and b.

The PDF is useful in probability and statistics because it can be used to calculate the probability of a random variable taking on a value in a certain interval or range, by integrating the PDF over that interval or range.
