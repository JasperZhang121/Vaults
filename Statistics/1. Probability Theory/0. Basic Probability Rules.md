Probability is the measure of the likelihood of an event occurring. In statistics, we use probability to make predictions and draw inferences about data.

## Terminology

Before diving into the basic probability rules, it's important to understand some basic terminology:

-   **Experiment**: The process that produces the outcomes.
-   **Outcome**: The result of an experiment.
-   **Event**: One or more outcomes of an experiment.
-   **Sample Space**: The set of all possible outcomes of an experiment.

## Basic Probability Rules

### Rule 1: Probability is between 0 and 1

The probability of any event happening is always between 0 and 1, where 0 means that the event is impossible and 1 means that the event is certain to happen.

### Rule 2: Probability of a Complement Event

The complement of an event is the event that the original event did not occur. The probability of the complement of an event is equal to one minus the probability of the original event. That is:

P(A') = 1 - P(A)

### Rule 3: Addition Rule

The addition rule is used to find the probability of the union of two events, A and B. That is, the probability of either event A or event B happening. The formula for the addition rule is:

P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)

Where P(A and B) is the probability of both events A and B happening at the same time.

### Rule 4: Multiplication Rule

The multiplication rule is used to find the probability of the intersection of two events, A and B. That is, the probability of both events A and B happening. The formula for the multiplication rule is:

P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B|A)

Where P(B|A) is the probability of event B happening given that event A has already occurred.
