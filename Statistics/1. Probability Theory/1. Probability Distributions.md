A probability distribution is a function that describes the likelihood of obtaining different possible values for a random variable. Probability distributions can be classified into two types:

1.  Discrete probability distributions: These are distributions where the random variable takes on a countable number of possible values. Examples include the binomial distribution, Poisson distribution, and geometric distribution.
    
2.  Continuous probability distributions: These are distributions where the random variable can take on any value within a continuous range. Examples include the normal distribution, exponential distribution, and beta distribution.
    

## Common probability distributions

### Binomial distribution

The binomial distribution models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent trials, where each trial has the same probability of success.

-   **Notation:** $X \sim B(n,p)$, where $n$ is the number of trials and $p$ is the probability of success in each trial.
-   **Probability mass function (PMF):** $P(X = k) = \binom{n}{k}p^k(1-p)^{n-k}$, where $k$ is the number of successes.

### Poisson distribution

The Poisson distribution models the number of occurrences of a rare event in a fixed amount of time.

-   **Notation:** $X \sim P(\lambda)$, where $\lambda$ is the average rate of occurrence.
-   **PMF:** $P(X = k) = \frac{\lambda^k e^{-\lambda}}{k!}$, where $k$ is the number of occurrences.

### Normal distribution

The normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution, is a continuous probability distribution that is widely used in statistics to model real-valued random variables.

-   **Notation:** $X \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$, where $\mu$ is the mean and $\sigma^2$ is the variance.
-   **Probability density function (PDF):** $f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma}e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}$

### Exponential distribution

The exponential distribution models the time between successive events in a Poisson process.

-   **Notation:** $X \sim Exp(\lambda)$, where $\lambda$ is the rate parameter.
-   **PDF:** $f(x) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x}$

### Beta distribution

The beta distribution is a continuous probability distribution that is used to model probabilities or proportions.

-   **Notation:** $X \sim Beta(\alpha, \beta)$, where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are shape parameters.
-   **PDF:** $f(x) = \frac{x^{\alpha-1}(1-x)^{\beta-1}}{B(\alpha, \beta)}$, where $B(\alpha, \beta)$ is the beta function.
