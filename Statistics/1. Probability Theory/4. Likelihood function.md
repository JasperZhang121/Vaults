1.  Normal likelihood function:

The likelihood function for a set of n observations $x1, x2, ..., xn$ that are assumed to be independently and identically distributed (iid) as $N(μ, σ^2)$ is:

$$L(μ, σ^2|x1, x2, ..., xn) = (2πσ^2)^(-n/2) * exp(-∑(xi - μ)^2 / (2σ^2))$$

where μ is the mean and σ^2 is the variance of the normal distribution.

2.  Bernoulli likelihood function:

The likelihood function for a set of n observations x1, x2, ..., xn that are assumed to be iid as Bernoulli(p) is:

$$L(p|x1, x2, ..., xn) = p^(∑xi) * (1-p)^(n-∑xi)$$

where p is the probability of success (i.e., the parameter of the Bernoulli distribution).

3.  Poisson likelihood function:

The likelihood function for a set of n observations x1, x2, ..., xn that are assumed to be iid as Poisson(λ) is:

$$L(λ|x1, x2, ..., xn) = exp(-nλ) * λ^(∑xi) / (∏xi!)$$

where λ is the rate parameter of the Poisson distribution.

4.  Exponential likelihood function:

The likelihood function for a set of n observations x1, x2, ..., xn that are assumed to be iid as Exponential(β) is:

$$L(β|x1, x2, ..., xn) = β^(-n) * exp(-∑xi / β)$$

where β is the rate parameter of the Exponential distribution.
