Mean Squared Error is a commonly used metric to evaluate the performance of regression models.

The MSE measures the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values of the target variable. Specifically, the MSE is calculated as the sum of the squared differences between the predicted and actual values, divided by the total number of data points:

$$MSE = (1/n) * âˆ‘(i=1 to n) (y_pred,i - y_true,i)^2$$

where n is the number of data points, $y_pred$,i is the predicted value for the i-th data point, and $y_true$,i is the true (observed) value for the i-th data point.

The MSE is a non-negative value, where lower values indicate better model performance. It is easy to interpret because it is in the same units as the target variable, and it is sensitive to both large and small errors in the predictions.

One drawback of the MSE is that it penalizes large errors more than small errors, due to the squaring of the differences. This can make the MSE sensitive to outliers in the data. To overcome this, alternative metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Huber loss may be used, which provide less emphasis on large errors.
