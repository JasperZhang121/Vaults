In [statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics "Statistics"), **linear regression** is a [linear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linearity "Linearity") approach for modelling the relationship between a [scalar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_(mathematics) "Scalar (mathematics)") response and one or more explanatory variables (also known as [dependent and independent variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables "Dependent and independent variables")). The case of one explanatory variable is called _[simple linear regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_linear_regression "Simple linear regression")_; for more than one, the process is called **multiple linear regression**.

Examples:

```python

# import and prepare
import pandas as pd
data=pd.read_excel('example.xlsx')
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# create linear regression model
lr_model = LinearRegression()

# set training set
x = np.array(x)
y = np.array(y)
x = x.reshape(-1,1)
y = y.reshape(-1,1)

# train 
lr_model.fit(x,y)

# y_predict
y_predi = lr_model.predict(x)
```


### Details:

-   Linear Regression models the relationship between <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">one dependent variable and multiple explanatory variables</mark>.
-   The input to the model includes independent, explanatory, and predictor variables, while the output is a dependent, target, or response variable.
-   Regression provides a way to predict a continuous variable given other variables, which are typically also continuous.
-   Ordinal independent or dependent variables can be mapped to numeric values, and nominal variables, including binary, can also be mapped to numeric values, but this requires careful assessment of their effect on results.
-   Regression is different from classification, which predicts categorical class labels.
-   Types of relationships considered in regression include deterministic and statistical relationships.
-   A deterministic relationship is one where the relationship between explanatory and dependent variables is perfect.
-   A statistical relationship is one where the relationship between explanatory and dependent variables is not perfect.
