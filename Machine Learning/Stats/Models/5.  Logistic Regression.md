## Precision

Precision is defined as the number of true positive results divided by the number of true positive results plus the number of false positive results.

$$ Precision = \frac{True\ Positives}{True\ Positives + False\ Positives} $$

## Recall

Recall is defined as the number of true positive results divided by the number of true positive results plus the number of false negative results.

$$ Recall = \frac{True\ Positives}{True\ Positives + False\ Negatives} $$

## F1 Score

F1 Score is a metric that calculates the harmonic mean between precision and recall. It is often used as a single metric to summarize the overall performance of a binary classifier system.

$$ F1 = 2 * \frac{Precision * Recall}{Precision + Recall} $$

Where Precision is the ratio of true positive predictions to all positive predictions, and Recall is the ratio of true positive predictions to all actual positive cases.
