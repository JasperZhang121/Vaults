Neural networks are a type of machine learning model that are based on the <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">structure and function of the human brain</mark>. They consist of a set of connected nodes, where each node is an input, output, or hidden layer, and each connection between nodes has a weight associated with it. During training, the weights are adjusted to allow the network to correctly output the desired output for a given input. The classic training algorithm for neural networks is called backpropagation.

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a type of neural network that are especially well-suited for image recognition and other problems where the input has a spatial structure. They use specific architectures and connection patterns to learn features at different scales and locations in the input.

Strengths of neural networks as a classifier include their high tolerance to noisy data, ability to classify untrained patterns, and suitability for continuous-valued inputs and outputs. They have been successful on a wide range of real-world data, such as hand-written letters, images, and voice. Neural network algorithms are inherently parallel and can take advantage of modern hardware to speed up training and inference. Techniques have also been developed to extract rules from trained neural networks.

Weaknesses of neural networks include their long training time and the need to determine a number of parameters empirically, such as network topology or structure. They also tend to overfit when there are a large number of nodes, which implies a large number of weights to be learned. Neural networks are generally difficult to interpret, as the learned weights and hidden units have no clear symbolic meaning, and they are often referred to as "black box" models.
