The expected value tells us a single number that we can use to represent our random variable, which is the average value. It's important to also measure risk, or how close to the expected value we're actually likely to get. For this we use use _variance_, which can quantify the difference between, say, playing the game above with a fair coin, and simply being handed \$0.50. The variance of a random variable is defined as

$$ Var(X) = E\left([X - E(X)]^2 \right) $$

It is also sometimes written as $\sigma^2(X)$, and $\sigma$ (the positive square root of the variance) is called the _standard deviation_. This is often more useful because it is in the same units as the original data, so it is directly comprable.
