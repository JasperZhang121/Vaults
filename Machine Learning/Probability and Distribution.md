Learning the model parameters using adversarial samples is referred to as adversarial training

Adversarial Example:
A person wearing an adversarial patch is not detected by a person detector model.

### Discrete Probabilities

<br/>
Joint probability: 

If discrete random variables X and Y are defined on the same sample space S, then their _**joint probability mass function**_ **(joint pmf)** is given by  

p(x,y)=P(X=x  and  Y=y)

where (x,y) is a pair of possible values for the pair of random variables (X,Y), and p(x,y) satisfies the following conditions:

-   0≤p(x,y)≤1
-   ∑∑(x,y) p(x,y)=1
-   P((X,Y)∈A))=∑∑(x,y)∈A p(x,y)

<br/>
Marginal probabilities:
The marginal probability that X = x irrespective of the value of Y is written as p(x)
If we consider only the instances where X = x, then the fraction of instances (conditional probability) for which Y = y is written as p(y|x).

<br/>
Conditinal probabilities:
The fraction of a row or column in a particular cell.

### Continuous Probabilities

Probability density function:
In [probability theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_theory "Probability theory"), a **probability density function** (**PDF**), or **density** of a [continuous random variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_random_variable "Continuous random variable"), is a [function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics) "Function (mathematics)") whose value at any given sample (or point) in the [sample space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_space "Sample space") (the set of possible values taken by the random variable) can be interpreted as providing a _relative likelihood_ that the value of the random variable would be equal to that sample.

The Gaussian distribution is the most well-studied probability distribution for continuous-valued random variables. It is also referred to as the normal distribution. The special case of the Gaussian with zero mean and identity covariance, is referred to as the standard normal distribution.
