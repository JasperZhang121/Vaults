1. Framing: The data link layer encapsulates network layer data into <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">frames or packets</mark>. It adds a header and a trailer to the data, delineating the boundaries of each frame. This framing allows for the identification and synchronization of the transmitted data.
    
2. Physical Addressing: The data link layer assigns unique physical addresses to network devices, known as <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">Media Access Control (MAC)</mark> addresses. MAC addresses are used to identify the source and destination devices within the same network. This addressing enables the delivery of frames to the intended recipient.
    
3. Error Detection and Correction: The data link layer implements error detection mechanisms to ensure data integrity during transmission. It employs techniques such as checksums or cyclic redundancy checks (CRC) to detect errors in the received frames. When errors are detected, the data link layer can request retransmission or take corrective measures.
    
4. Flow Control: The data link layer manages the flow of data between the sender and receiver to prevent overwhelming the receiving device. It regulates the rate of data transmission, ensuring that the sender does not inundate the receiver with more data than it can handle. Flow control mechanisms prevent data loss and congestion.
    
5. Access Control: In shared media networks, the data link layer implements access control mechanisms to determine which devices can access the network at a given time. It prevents collisions and manages the contention for the shared medium. Access control protocols, such as Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) or Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA), are employed to coordinate access among multiple devices.
