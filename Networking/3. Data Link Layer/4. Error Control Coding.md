Error control coding, also known as error correction coding, belongs to the field of channel coding. The basic principle is to introduce redundant code symbols (parity symbols) into the information symbol sequence according to a certain relationship. This allows the decoder to use this relationship to detect or correct possible errors.

Error Control Techniques

1. Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) - The encoder <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">sends codes capable of detecting errors</mark>, and the receiver <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">requests retransmission</mark> until a correct transmission is received.
2. Forward Error Correction (FEC) - The encoder sends codes capable of correcting errors, and the <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">receiver automatically corrects</mark> the errors <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">without requiring retransmission</mark>.
3. Error Detection and Discard - Similar to ARQ, but instead of requesting retransmission, the <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">receiver simply discards the incorrect data</mark>.
4. Feedback Verification - The received information is sent <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">back to the sender unchanged</mark> for comparison. If they are not the same, the sender retransmits the data.
