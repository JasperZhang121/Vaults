**Units:**

-   b/s (bits per second)
-   kb/s (kilobits per second)
-   Mb/s (megabits per second)
-   Gb/s (gigabits per second)
-   Tb/s (terabits per second)

1 kb/s = 10^3 b/s 1 Mb/s = 10^6 b/s 1 Gb/s = 10^3 Mb/s = 10^6 kb/s = 10^9 b/s

**Bandwidth:** A measure of the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">data transfer rate or capacity of a given network</mark>, typically measured in bits per second (bps). The bandwidth of a network determines how much data can be transmitted over a given period of time. A network with a higher bandwidth can transmit more data than a network with a lower bandwidth.

**Link:** A communication channel that connects two or more devices for the purpose of data transmission. A link can be wired, such as an Ethernet cable, or wireless, such as a Wi-Fi or Bluetooth connection.

**Throughput:** The amount of <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">data successfully moved from one place to another in a given time period</mark>, typically measured in bits per second (bps). Throughput can be affected by factors such as network congestion, latency, and packet loss. High throughput is desirable, as it indicates that data is being transmitted quickly and efficiently through the network.
