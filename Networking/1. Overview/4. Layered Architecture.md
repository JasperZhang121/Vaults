### Importance of Computer Network Layered Architecture:

-   The layered architecture’s major goal is to split the design into smaller, manageable parts, which allows for easier maintenance and scalability.
-   Each <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">lower layer of the network contributes its services to the layer above it</mark>, resulting in a complete set of services for managing communications and running applications.
-   The layered architecture provides modularity and explicit interfaces, allowing subsystems to interact with one another in a well-defined manner. This makes it easier to develop and maintain complex network systems.
-   The layered architecture ensures layer independence by offering services from the lowest to the highest layer without specifying how the services are implemented. As a result, <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">any changes made to one layer have no effect on the other layers</mark>.
-   The number of layers, functions, and contents of each layer may differ from one network to another, but the objective of each layer is to offer the service from a lower to a higher layer while hiding the details of how the services are performed from the layers above.

In summary, the layered architecture is an important design pattern for computer networks that provides several benefits, such as <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">modularity, scalability, and layer independence</mark>. By dividing the network into distinct layers, each with its own set of services and interfaces, network administrators can more easily manage complex systems and adapt to changing network requirements.

### Fundamental Components of Layered Architecture:

Services, protocols, and interfaces are the fundamental components of a layered architecture.

#### 1. Service:

A service is a collection of activities provided by a layer to a higher layer. Each layer provides a set of services to the layer above it, which are used to facilitate communication and data transfer between devices in the network.

#### 2. Protocol:

A protocol is a collection of rules that a layer employs to share data with a peer entity. These rules primarily address the contents and order of the messages used. Protocols define how data is formatted, transmitted, and received between devices in the network.

#### 3. Interface:

An interface is the means through which a message is transmitted from one layer to another. Each layer provides a well-defined interface that specifies the services it offers to the layer above it and the services it expects to receive from the layer below it.

In a layered architecture, each layer communicates with the corresponding layer on another device, and the rules employed in the interaction are referred to as a layer-n protocol. The combination of services, protocols, and interfaces at each layer of the network stack forms a complete set of tools for managing communications and running applications.

### Features of Layered Architecture:

-   In the case of layered architecture, no data is transmitted from one machine’s layer n to another machine’s layer n. Instead, until the lowest layer is reached, each layer transmits the data to the one directly below it.
-   The physical channel via which real communication takes place is located underneath layer 1.
-   Unmanageable activities are split into smaller, more manageable jobs in a layered architecture.
-   Data is sent from the upper layer to the bottom layer via an interface. A layered design provides a clear interface so that only the most important information is communicated across levels. It also assures that one layer’s implementation may be readily changed by another.
