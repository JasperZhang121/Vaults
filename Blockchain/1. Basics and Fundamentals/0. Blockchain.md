### **Definition**
Blockchain is a distributed database or ledger that is shared among the nodes of a computer network.

### **Key Characteristics**:
  - **Decentralization**: No central authority controls the network.
  - **Transparency**: <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">All transactions are visible to everyone in the network</mark>.
  - **Immutability**: Once recorded, the data in any given block <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">cannot be altered without altering all subsequent blocks</mark>.

### How Blockchain Works
1. **Transaction**: Every transaction is recorded in a block.
2. **Block Creation**: Once a transaction is confirmed, it is grouped into a block.
3. **Block Validation**:
    - Nodes or "miners" validate transactions and blocks through consensus algorithms (e.g., Proof of Work, Proof of Stake).
4. **Chain Formation**: Validated blocks are added to the existing blockchain in <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">a linear, chronological order</mark>.
5. **Transaction Finality**: Once added to the blockchain, the transaction is immutable and becomes part of the public ledger.

### Types
- **Public Blockchain**: Open to anyone (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum).
- **Private Blockchain**: Access is restricted to certain users (e.g., Hyperledger, Corda).
- **Consortium Blockchain**: Controlled by a group of organizations (e.g., R3).

### Applications
- **Cryptocurrencies**: Digital or virtual currency uses cryptography for security (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum).
- **Smart Contracts**: <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller</mark> being directly written into lines of code.
- **Supply Chain Management**: Enhances the traceability and accountability of the supply chain.
- **Voting Systems**: Increases transparency and reduces the potential for election fraud.

### Challenges and Considerations
- **Scalability**: Handling a large number of transactions efficiently.
- **Security**: Protecting against cyber attacks and fraud.
- **Regulation**: Navigating legal and regulatory frameworks.

### Future Prospects
- **Integration with other technologies**: AI, IoT, etc.
- **New business models**: Decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), etc.
