### Blocks
- **Definition**: A block is a container data structure that aggregates transactions for inclusion in the public ledger, the blockchain.
- **Components**:
  - **Block Header**: Contains metadata, including a reference to the previous block (hash), timestamp, and a nonce (number used once).
  - **Transaction List**: Batch of transactions validated and included in the block.

```python
from hashlib import sha256
from datetime import datetime

class Block():
  def __init__(self, data, previous_block_hash):
    self.timestamp = datetime.utcnow()
    self.data = data
    self.prev_block_hash = previous_block_hash
    self.calculate_valid_hash()

  def is_hash_valid(self, hash):
        return (hash.startswith('0' * 3))

  def calculate_valid_hash(self):
      hash = ''
      nonce = 0

      while (not self.is_hash_valid(hash)):
          temp = self.to_string() + str(nonce)
          hash = sha256(temp.encode()).hexdigest()
          nonce += 1

      self.hash = hash

  def to_string(self):
    return "{0}\t{1}\t{2}".format(self.data, self.timestamp, self.prev_block_hash)
```

### Chains
- **Definition**: A blockchain is a sequentially linked list of blocks, each referencing its predecessor, forming a chain.
- **Immutable Ledger**: Once a block is added to the chain, altering its content requires changing all subsequent blocks, making it tamper-resistant.

```python
from block import Block

class Blockchain():
    def __init__(self):
        self.blocks =[]
        self.set_genesis_block()
    
    def set_genesis_block(self):
        data = "Genesis\t"
        prev_hash = '0'*64
        genesis_block = Block(data, prev_hash)
        self.blocks.append(genesis_block)
    
    def get_last_hash(self):
        last_block = self.blocks[-1]
        last_hash = last_block.hash
        return (last_hash)

    def add_new_block(self, data):
        prev_hash = self.get_last_hash()
        new_block = Block(data, prev_hash)
        self.blocks.append(new_block)

    def get_blocks(self):
        return (self.blocks)
```

### Nodes
- **Definition**: Nodes are individual computers that connect to the blockchain network, each maintaining a copy of the ledger.
- **Types**:
  - **Full Nodes**: Store a complete copy of the blockchain and validate transactions and blocks.
  - **Light Nodes**: Store only essential information and rely on full nodes for additional data.

### Consensus Mechanisms
- **Purpose**: Ensure all nodes agree on the ledger's state, even in the presence of faulty or malicious participants.
- **Types**:
  - **Proof of Work (PoW)**: Requires nodes to solve complex mathematical problems, which consumes computational resources, to add new blocks (e.g., Bitcoin).
  - **Proof of Stake (PoS)**: Gives block validation rights to nodes based on the number of tokens they hold and are willing to "stake" as collateral.
  - **Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)**: Token holders vote on a select number of delegates who validate transactions and create blocks.
  - **Proof of Authority (PoA)**: Trusted nodes, known as validators, are given the right to create and validate new blocks.
