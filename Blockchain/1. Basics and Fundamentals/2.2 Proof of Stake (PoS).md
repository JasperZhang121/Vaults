Proof of Stake (PoS) was first proposed in 2013 and implemented in the Peercoin system. It is similar to the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">shareholder mechanism in real life, where individuals with more shares are more likely to gain the right to keep the ledger (and are more inclined to maintain the normal operation of the network)</mark>.

## Process
The typical process involves staking (tokens, assets, reputation, or any valuable item) to <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">bet on a legitimate block becoming the new block</mark>. The earnings consist of interest on the staked capital and transaction fees. The more the stake provided as proof (e.g., through currency transfer records), the greater the probability of obtaining ledger-keeping rights. Legitimate ledger-keepers earn profits.

## PoS vs. PoW
PoS aims to address the issue of massive resource wastage in PoW systems, garnering widespread attention. Malicious participants face the risk of forfeiture of their stakes, leading to economic loss.

## Security and Influence
Generally, in PoS, controlling more than one-third of the network's resources is necessary to influence the outcome. This is analogous to a voting scenario where the third voter's decision is crucial in a three-person vote.

## Improvements and Algorithms
- **Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)**: In DPoS, shareholders vote to elect a board of directors, and only the board members have the authority to delegate ledger-keeping. These algorithms have been validated in practice, though they lack theoretical proof.
- **Ouroboros Protocol**: In August 2017, scholars like Aggelos Kiayias from the University of Edinburgh and the University of Connecticut introduced the Ouroboros blockchain consensus protocol in their paper "Ouroboros: A Provably Secure Proof-of-Stake Blockchain Protocol". This protocol achieves an approximate <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Nash equilibrium</mark> of honest behavior and is considered the first provably secure PoS protocol.
