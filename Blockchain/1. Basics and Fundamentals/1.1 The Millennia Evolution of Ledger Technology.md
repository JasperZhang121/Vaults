### Ledger Technology
If Financial Technology (Fintech) is considered a crucial pillar supporting social civilization, Ledger Technology, or bookkeeping technology, is the cornerstone of this pillar.

From international trade to personal consumption, the seemingly ordinary yet complex task of bookkeeping is indispensable. Both capital flow and asset transactions rely on banks and trading institutions to maintain their bookkeeping systems accurately.

It's not an exaggeration to say that the entire development of human civilization has accompanied the continuous evolution of ledger technology.

Currently, there is little research on the evolutionary patterns of ledger technology, leading to limited public understanding of it. In recent years, blockchain-based distributed ledger technology has rapidly emerged and been swiftly applied. Despite this, few can clearly articulate the relationship between blockchain and bookkeeping problems. What issues does blockchain solve, and why has it had such a significant impact in the finance sector?

According to general technological evolution, the historical development of ledger technology can be divided into four stages: <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">single-entry ledger, double-entry ledger, digital ledger, and distributed ledger</mark>. The periods and characteristics of each stage are shown in the following table.

| Stage | Period | Main Characteristics |
|-------|--------|----------------------|
| **Stage 1: Single-Entry Ledger** | c. 3500 BC - 15th century | Use of primitive single-entry bookkeeping |
| **Stage 2: Double-Entry Ledger** | 15th century - mid-20th century | Appearance and application of modern double-entry bookkeeping |
| **Stage 3: Digital Ledger** | Mid-20th century - early 21st century | Evolution from physical medium ledgers to digital ledgers |
| **Stage 4: Distributed Ledger** | 2009 - present | Emergence of ideas and technologies related to blockchain-based distributed ledgers |

### The Evolution

#### Stage 1: Single-Entry Ledger
In the early stages of human civilization, there was already a need for bookkeeping and related activities.

The earliest known ledger is the "Kushim clay tablet," unearthed in 1929 on the lower right bank of the Euphrates in Iraq. It dates back to c. 3500 - 3000 BC in the city of Uruk, a Sumerian city in southwestern Mesopotamia. The tablet is interpreted to record "37 months of barley received, totaling 29,086 units, approved by Kushim."

The Kushim clay tablet is also the oldest known written human record. Apart from the fleeting Sumerian civilization, early civilizations in ancient China, Egypt, Greece, and Rome all have archaeological discoveries related to bookkeeping.

The method of recording transactions individually, known as "single-entry bookkeeping," involved a ledger called a "single-entry ledger."

This method continued to be used for a long time, even until today, whether recorded on clay tablets, ropes, or later paper ledgers. Although the physical mediums changed, the core method remained consistent.

Single-entry bookkeeping is <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">naturally easy to use and suitable for small-scale, simple accounting</mark>. However, it shows many problems when facing large-scale transactions, especially those involving multiple entities.

- First, it is prone to errors. Taking the Kushim ledger as an example, if there are many barley storage and removal transactions, <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">it is challenging to confirm whether the ledger entries match the actual situations; even if discrepancies are found, it is hard to pinpoint which record is problematic</mark>.

- Second, it is susceptible to tampering. Since there is only one ledger kept by the bookkeeper, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">if the bookkeeper is dishonest, they could easily modify existing records to steal barley, and others would find it difficult to detect any tampering</mark>.

As commercial activities became more common, transaction scales grew, and more parties became involved (especially with the separation of owners and operators), single-entry bookkeeping could no longer meet the increasing demands for accounting accuracy. Thus, the "double-entry bookkeeping" method, representing modern accounting thought, emerged.

#### Stage 2: Double-Entry Ledger
The 14th century in Italy marked the gateway to global trade, attracting merchants, scholars, artists, and craftsmen from around the world, heralding the era of the Renaissance. Over the next three centuries, Europe experienced a surge of innovations in business, culture, arts, and technology, significantly impacting the entire world. Notable among these were:

- **The Reformation**: Martin Luther criticized many of the Christian church's failings, proposing that religion should not have a hierarchical system, meaning <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">everyone is equal before religion without the need for any intermediaries or mediators</mark>;

- **Heliocentric Cosmology**: From geocentrism to heliocentrism and eventually to the formation of a cosmological view, humanity finally recognized that Earth is not the "center" of the universe. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Any position could be considered the center, and being at the center is neither special nor important</mark>;

- **Double-Entry Bookkeeping**: The unprecedented prosperity of commercial activities nurtured a more advanced method of bookkeeping. <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Double-entry bookkeeping split single-center records into multiple accounts, significantly enhancing the reliability of the accounts</mark>. If problems were discovered, it was easier to trace their origins. The corresponding ledger is called a "double-entry ledger."

These achievements, although in different fields like culture, astronomy, and finance, shared a consistent and harmonious core idea, which is quite astonishing.

The earliest written records of double-entry bookkeeping appeared in 1494, when the famous Italian mathematician Luca Pacioli introduced the principles and applications of arithmetic, the measurement systems of different regions in Italy, commercial bookkeeping methods, and the foundations of geometry in his work "Summa de arithmetica, geometria, Proportioni et proportionalita (Summary of Arithmetic, Geometry, Proportion, and Proportionality)." Of course, the emergence of double-entry bookkeeping is the result of centuries of commercial activity and mathematical development. As early as 1202, the mathematician Fibonacci from Pisa, Italy, introduced Eastern mathematical concepts in "The Book of Calculation," including decimal Arabic numerals and fractions, and explained how to use these mathematical tools for bookkeeping and calculating interest. These greatly promoted the development of the financial industry.

**Double-entry bookkeeping** has evolved to include various methods such as <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">increase-decrease bookkeeping, payment-receipt bookkeeping, and debit-credit bookkeeping</mark>. Currently, the most commonly used is debit-credit bookkeeping, based on the accounting identity (Assets = Liabilities + Equity), ensuring that each transaction is recorded according to this equation. Double-entry bookkeeping quickly became widely used and became a fundamental part of modern accounting. Luca Pacioli is also known as the "Father of Accounting."

The principle of double-entry bookkeeping is not complex. Since the essence of a transaction is the transfer of value from a source to a target, each transaction can be recorded separately in the credit (source) and debit (target) accounts, and the total amounts of the debit and credit should always be equal (i.e., conserved).

If Kushim had known about double-entry bookkeeping, when barley was stored, it would have been recorded in both the "Barley Inventory Account" and the "Accounts Receivable for Barley," and the recorded amounts would have matched. If an audit was conducted, different accounts could be analyzed to check if their results match. Thus, double-entry bookkeeping makes it easy to trace the origins and verify the accuracy of transactions. In fact, Bitcoin's transaction model also draws from the idea of double-entry bookkeeping.

Although double-entry bookkeeping solved the credibility issues of local ledgers held by individual bookkeepers, it still could not address the problem of trust among multiple parties. For example, how can investors be sure that the accounts of the companies they invest in are not falsified? Which ledger should be considered accurate in a trade dispute between two parties? These questions would only be answered centuries later.

Note: Debit means debt, indicating a transfer to the account; Credit means credit, indicating a transfer out of the account.

#### Stage 3: Digital Ledger
If the 20th century's ten greatest inventions were to be ranked, the digital computer would definitely make the list. It created a new cyberspace beyond the physical world, bringing tremendous changes to all aspects of human society.

One of the earliest uses of computers was for statistical processing related to accounting. In 1951, the world's first commercial computer, UNIVAC, was used by the U.S. Census Bureau.

Using computers not only improved the efficiency of large-scale bookkeeping but also avoided errors in manual operations. To better manage statistical data, specialized database technology was invented. <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">From the earliest network databases and hierarchical databases to the groundbreaking relational databases, and then to big data and NoSQL technologies that emerged after the internet, all these were fundamentally related to bookkeeping issues</mark>.

In this stage, there wasn't much innovation in bookkeeping methods themselves, but the advent of digital media revolutionized the scale, speed, and complexity of ledgers. These developments laid the technical foundation for various digital services, including e-commerce and internet finance.

#### Stage 4: Distributed Ledger
Although double-entry bookkeeping recorded the origins and details of transactions and was less prone to errors, it was fundamentally a centralized model.

The centralized model of bookkeeping systems was convenient to use, but there were still many problems: <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">if data was lost, it could not be recovered</mark>; in situations involving multiple trading parties, <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">maintaining separate ledgers for each party made reconciliation difficult if inconsistencies arose</mark>.

Therefore, it was natural to think of using the concept of distributed systems to implement a distributed ledger (Distributed Ledger): <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">maintained by multiple trading parties, a shared distributed ledger could trace transactions through different stages</mark>; with distributed technology, further enhancements in the scale, efficiency, reliability, and compliance of bookkeeping could be achieved.

However, in a distributed setting, how to prevent a participant from maliciously altering or destroying records? Who should decide to record transactions in the ledger? These questions had not been well resolved until then.

In January 2009, the Bitcoin network, based on blockchain structure, quietly emerged, integrating modern cryptography and distributed network technology. In the following years, the Bitcoin network reliably supported massive amounts of transfer transactions in a purely distributed scenario. This made people realize that blockchain, a seemingly simple data structure, perfectly met the basic needs of distributed bookkeeping, and thus, distributed ledger technologies based on the blockchain structure began to emerge en masse. Because these technologies often use the blockchain structure as their core ledger structure, they are often collectively referred to as blockchain technology.

Starting in 2014, experts in the finance and tech sectors began to pay attention to blockchain technology and actively promoted the implementation of distributed ledger applications. During this process, the demand for open, advanced distributed ledger platforms became increasingly urgent.

At the end of 2015, thirty <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">leading companies in the finance and tech sectors (including IBM, Accenture, Intel, J.P.Morgan, DTCC, SWIFT, Cisco, etc.) jointly launched the Hyperledger open-source project</mark>, managed by the neutral Linux Foundation. Following the Apache v2 license (business-friendly), the project aims to create an open-source, enterprise-focused distributed ledger technology ecosystem. Around the core demands of enterprise distributed ledgers, the Hyperledger community has grown to include 16 major projects and over 280 global corporate members, supporting numerous application cases.

Currently, various innovative solutions based on distributed ledger technology have been implemented in fields such as <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">finance, supply chain, and healthcare</mark>. However, I believe that, analogous to the development of the internet, distributed ledger technology is still in its early stages, with many issues yet to be resolved, including <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">permission management, privacy protection, performance optimization, and interoperability</mark>. Future technological breakthroughs in these areas will greatly expand the application scenarios and forms of distributed ledger technology, ultimately realizing a business collaboration network that transfers "value".
