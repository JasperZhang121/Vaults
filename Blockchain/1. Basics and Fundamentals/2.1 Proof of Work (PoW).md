Proof of Work (PoW) involves computing to guess a number, known as a nonce, such that the hash value of the content, when appended with transaction data, meets a specified upper limit. This concept originates from hashcash and requires extensive computation, ensuring that only a few legitimate proposals emerge within a set period.

## Mechanism
- **Legitimate Proposals**: Proposers who can make <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">a legitimate proposal demonstrate that they have expended a certain amount of work</mark>.
- **Broadcasting and Validation**: Legitimate proposals are broadcast across the network. <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Users validate these proposals and continue computing puzzles based on the longest chain</mark>.
- **Chain Forks**: The system might experience forks, but ultimately one chain becomes the <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">longest and is accepted</mark>.

###  Example: Bitcoin network
First, a user initiates a transaction through the Bitcoin client, and the message is broadcast to the Bitcoin network waiting for confirmation. Nodes in the network <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">bundle the received transactions awaiting confirmation</mark>, add information such as the hash value of the previous block header, and form a block structure. Then, they attempt to <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">find a nonce string</mark> (a random string) to place in the block, so that the hash result of the block structure <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">meets certain conditions</mark> (such as being less than a specific value). This process of calculating the nonce string is commonly known as 'mining.' The search for the nonce string requires a certain amount of computational power.

Once a node finds a nonce string that meets the conditions, the <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">block is "legally" formed and becomes a candidate block</mark>. The node then broadcasts it across the network. <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Other nodes receive the candidate block and verify it</mark>. Upon finding it valid, they recognize this block as a new legal block and add it to their own locally maintained blockchain structure. <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">When most nodes have accepted the block, it means that the block has been accepted by the network, and the transactions included in the block are thus confirmed</mark>.

There are two key steps here: one is achieving consensus on a batch of transactions (creating a legal block structure); the other is adding the new block to the chain structure, being recognized by the network, ensuring it cannot be altered in the future. Of course, there are many additional details in the implementation.

## Hash Problems
- **Irreversibility**: Hash problems are irreversible, with <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">no effective solution other than brute force computation</mark>.
- **Nonce and Computational Power**: Obtaining the required nonce suggests that the corresponding computational power was expended. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">The more computational power one has, the higher the probability of solving the problem first</mark>.
- **51% Attack**: Controlling over half of the network's computational power can probabilistically dictate the blockchain's direction, leading to the possibility of a 51% attack.
	1. **Double Spending**: The attacker can spend the same digital currency twice. They do this by <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">reversing a transaction</mark> after it has been confirmed, making it appear as though the original transaction never happened. This is achieved by <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not including the transaction in the blocks they mine or by re-mining previously mined blocks</mark>.
	2. **Blockchain Reorganization**: The attacker can create a private fork of the blockchain, starting from a point before their transactions of interest. By <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">eventually publishing a longer and more difficult chain</mark>, they can replace the original chain. This can reverse transactions that were previously considered secure.
	3. **Censorship**: With majority control, the attacker could potentially <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">block certain transactions from being included in blocks</mark>. This can be used to censor specific users or organizations, disrupting their ability to participate in the blockchain network.
	4. **Loss of Trust and Security**: Such attacks can undermine the integrity and trust in the blockchain, as the decentralization and security are compromised. This might lead to a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">decrease in user adoption and a fall in the value of the blockchain's associated cryptocurrency</mark>.

## Economic Costs and Game Theory
- **Economic Costs**: Participants in the PoW computation contest face significant costs, including hardware, electricity, and maintenance.
- **Sunk Costs**: If no participant becomes the first to calculate the legitimate nonce value, these costs are sunk, deterring malicious disruptions.
- **Incentives and Longest Chain**: The system incentivizes rational participants to contribute to the longest chain, enhancing its robustness and resistance to attacks.

## Longest Chain Mechanism
- **Supermarket Analogy**: The longest chain mechanism is <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">similar to choosing the longest queue in a supermarket to ensure legitimacy and order</mark>.
- **Attack Resistance**: The longest chain mechanism enhances attack resistance, although it results in computational resources being wasted on non-longest chains.

## Improvements and Protocols
- **GHOST Protocol**: Introduces a tree structure based on the longest chain to improve transaction performance.
- **Conflux Algorithm**: Aims to scale Nakamoto Consensus to thousands of transactions per second, enhancing efficiency and throughput.
