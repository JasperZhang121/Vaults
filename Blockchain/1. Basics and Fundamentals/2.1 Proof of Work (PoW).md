Proof of Work (PoW) involves computing to guess a number, known as a nonce, such that the hash value of the content, when appended with transaction data, meets a specified upper limit. This concept originates from hashcash and requires extensive computation, ensuring that only a few legitimate proposals emerge within a set period.

## Mechanism
- **Legitimate Proposals**: Proposers who can make <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">a legitimate proposal demonstrate that they have expended a certain amount of work</mark>.
- **Broadcasting and Validation**: Legitimate proposals are broadcast across the network. <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Users validate these proposals and continue computing puzzles based on the longest chain</mark>.
- **Chain Forks**: The system might experience forks, but ultimately one chain becomes the <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">longest and is accepted</mark>.

## Hash Problems
- **Irreversibility**: Hash problems are irreversible, with no effective solution other than brute force computation.
- **Nonce and Computational Power**: Obtaining the required nonce suggests that the corresponding computational power was expended. The more computational power one has, the higher the probability of solving the problem first.
- **51% Attack**: Controlling over half of the network's computational power can probabilistically dictate the blockchain's direction, leading to the possibility of a 51% attack.

## Economic Costs and Game Theory
- **Economic Costs**: Participants in the PoW computation contest face significant costs, including hardware, electricity, and maintenance.
- **Sunk Costs**: If no participant becomes the first to calculate the legitimate nonce value, these costs are sunk, deterring malicious disruptions.
- **Incentives and Longest Chain**: The system incentivizes rational participants to contribute to the longest chain, enhancing its robustness and resistance to attacks.

## Longest Chain Mechanism
- **Supermarket Analogy**: The longest chain mechanism is similar to choosing the longest queue in a supermarket to ensure legitimacy and order.
- **Attack Resistance**: The longest chain mechanism enhances attack resistance, although it results in computational resources being wasted on non-longest chains.

## Improvements and Protocols
- **GHOST Protocol**: Introduces a tree structure based on the longest chain to improve transaction performance.
- **Conflux Algorithm**: Aims to scale Nakamoto Consensus to thousands of transactions per second, enhancing efficiency and throughput.
