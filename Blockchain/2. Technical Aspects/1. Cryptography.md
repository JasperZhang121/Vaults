### Definition
Cryptography is the practice of secure communication in the presence of third parties. In blockchain, it is used to secure transactions, control the creation of new blocks, and ensure the integrity and security of data.

### Cryptographic Hash Functions
- **Purpose**: Hash functions convert input data of any size into a fixed-size string of text, usually a hash value.
- **Properties**:
  - **Deterministic**: The same input will always produce the same hash.
  - **Quick Computation**: Hashes are fast to compute for any given input.
  - **Pre-image Resistance**: Given a hash, it is computationally infeasible to find the original input.
  - **Small Changes in Input Alter the Hash**: Even a minor change in input drastically changes the hash.
- **Role in Blockchain**:
  - Used to create a unique identifier for each block (block hash).
  - Ensures the integrity and immutability of the blockchain.

### Public Key Cryptography (Asymmetric Cryptography)
- **Mechanism**: Uses a pair of keys, <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">a public key and a private key, for encryption and decryption</mark>.
- **Public Key**: Known to everyone and used to encrypt messages or verify signatures.
- **Private Key**: Kept secret by the owner and used to decrypt messages or sign transactions.
- **Role in Blockchain**:
  - Enables secure transactions between parties.
  - Provides the foundation for digital signatures, which verify the authenticity of transactions.

### Digital Signatures
- **Function**: Digital signatures are used to verify the authenticity of a message or document.
- **Process**:
  - A user <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">signs a transaction with their private key, generating a digital signature</mark>.
  - Others can <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">verify this signature using the user’s public key, confirming the transaction’s origin and integrity</mark>.
- **Role in Blockchain**:
  - Ensure that transactions are authorized by the sender.
  - Prevent tampering with the transaction after it is signed.

### Cryptographic Keys and Wallets
- **Wallet**: A digital wallet stores a user’s private and public keys, allowing them to send and receive cryptocurrencies.
- **Key Management**: The security of a blockchain system heavily relies on how well private keys are protected and managed.

### Cryptography and Consensus
- **Use in Consensus Mechanisms**: Cryptography is integral to various consensus mechanisms like Proof of Work and Proof of Stake, ensuring secure and fair block validation and addition to the blockchain.
