### Transaction Creation

- **Initiation**: A user initiates a transaction by creating a digital request. This request includes the sender's and receiver's blockchain addresses, the amount to be transferred, and a transaction fee that incentivizes miners or validators to process the transaction.
- **Digital Signing**: To ensure the transaction is secure and cannot be tampered with, the sender <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">signs it using their private key</mark>. This signature verifies the sender's identity and ensures that only they can initiate transactions from their account.

### Transaction Broadcasting
- **Network Distribution**: Once signed, the transaction is broadcast to the entire blockchain network. This is done via the peer-to-peer network that all blockchain nodes are part of.
- **Verification Process**: Upon receiving the transaction, nodes in the network validate it. They <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">check the digital signature against the sender's public key and ensure that the sender has enough balance</mark> to complete the transaction.

### Block Formation
- **Mempool**: After verification, transactions wait in <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">a pool of unconfirmed transactions</mark>, known as the mempool. Each node maintains its own version of this pool.
- **Block Creation**: <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Miners or validators select transactions from the mempool to form a new block</mark>. The selection process may depend on transaction fees; typically, higher fee transactions have a better chance of being included in the next block.

### Block Validation
- **Consensus Mechanism**: Nodes in the network use a consensus mechanism to agree on the next block to be added to the blockchain. This mechanism ensures that only valid blocks are added to the chain.
  - **Proof of Work (PoW)**: In this system, miners compete to solve a complex cryptographic puzzle. The first to solve the puzzle gets the right to add the new block to the blockchain. [[2.1 Proof of Work (PoW)]]
  - **Proof of Stake (PoS)**: Validators are chosen to create a new block based on the number of tokens they hold and are willing to "stake" or lock up as a form of security deposit. [[2.2 Proof of Stake (PoS)]]

### Chain Addition
- **Appending Blocks**: Once a block is validated, it is appended to the end of the blockchain. This block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, thus linking the blocks in a chain.
- **Network Consensus**: The new blockchain, with the newly added block, is then propagated across the network. Each node updates its copy of the blockchain to reflect the addition.

### Finality and Transparency

- **Immutability**: The blockchain design ensures that <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">once a block is added to the chain, it cannot be altered or deleted</mark>. This immutability is secured by the cryptographic linkage between blocks.
- **Public Ledger**: The <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">blockchain serves as a public ledger</mark>, allowing <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">anyone to view the entire history of transactions</mark>. This transparency helps build trust among users and ensures the integrity of the blockchain.
