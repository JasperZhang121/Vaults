### Introduction to Ethereum
- **Definition**: Ethereum is an open-source, blockchain-based platform that enables the creation of smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps).
- **Founding**: Proposed in late 2013 by Vitalik Buterin and development began in early 2014, with the network going live on July 30, 2015.

### Key Features of Ethereum
- **Smart Contracts**: Self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code, automatically enforced without intermediaries.
- **Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)**: A powerful, Turing-complete virtual machine that enables the execution of smart contracts.
- **Ether (ETH)**: The native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network, used to pay for transaction fees and computational services.

### Ethereum 1.0 vs Ethereum 2.0
- **Ethereum 1.0**:
  - Operates on a Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism.
  - Known for high gas fees and network congestion during peak times.
- **Ethereum 2.0**:
  - Transition to Proof of Stake (PoS) to increase scalability, reduce energy consumption, and improve transaction speed.
  - Implementation of sharding to distribute the computational and storage workload across multiple groups of nodes.

### Development on Ethereum
- **DApps**: Developers can build decentralized applications on the Ethereum platform across various sectors like finance, arts, and governance.
- **Tokens**: Facilitates the creation of new cryptocurrencies and tokens through Ethereum standards like ERC-20 (for fungible tokens) and ERC-721 (for non-fungible tokens or NFTs).

### Challenges and Solutions
- **Scalability**: Historically, Ethereum has faced scalability issues, handling only around 15 transactions per second (tps).
- **Network Upgrades**: Ongoing developments, including the transition to Ethereum 2.0, aim to address these issues through PoS and sharding.

### Ethereum's Role in Decentralized Finance (DeFi)
- **DeFi Ecosystem**: Ethereum is the leading platform for DeFi applications, offering decentralized financial services without traditional intermediaries.
- **Smart Contracts**: Enable complex financial transactions and programmable money through automated agreements.
