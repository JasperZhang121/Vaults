### **Definition**
Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency, without a central bank or single administrator, that can be sent from user to user on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network without the need for intermediaries.

### Key Characteristics of Bitcoin
- **Decentralization**: Operates on a decentralized network of computers where each participant (node) has equal authority and power.
- **Limited Supply**: <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Capped at 21 million coins to prevent inflation</mark>.
- **Anonymity and Transparency**: Transactions are recorded publicly, but the identities of the parties involved are encrypted.

### How Bitcoin Works
- **Transactions**: Made directly between users through cryptographic methods, verified by network nodes, and recorded in a public distributed ledger called the blockchain.
- **Mining**: The process by which new bitcoins are entered into circulation; it involves solving complex cryptographic puzzles to validate transactions and add them to the blockchain.

### Bitcoin Mining
- **Proof of Work (PoW)**: Consensus algorithm used in Bitcoin to ensure network security and validate transactions.
- **Block Reward**: Miners receive bitcoins as a reward for validating transactions and mining new blocks. This reward halves approximately every four years in an event known as the "halving."

### The Role of Bitcoin
- **Digital Gold**: Often referred to as digital gold due to its store of value and investment appeal.
- **Means of Payment**: Accepted by some merchants for goods and services, though its use as a currency is limited by volatility.

### Challenges and Criticisms
- **Scalability**: Bitcoin can process only a limited number of transactions per second, leading to potential delays and higher transaction fees during peak times.
- **Environmental Concerns**: The energy consumption of Bitcoin mining has raised environmental concerns due to its heavy use of electricity.

### Bitcoin's Significance
- **Market Leadership**: Remains the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and is considered the original cryptocurrency.
- **Cultural Impact**: Has spurred the development of thousands of other cryptocurrencies and introduced the world to the concept of blockchain.

## Mining

### The Genesis Block and Mining
- **Genesis Block**: The first block of the Bitcoin blockchain, mined by Satoshi Nakamoto.
- **Early Mining**: Initially focused on generating new bitcoins through the mining of blocks.

### How Mining Works
- **Transaction Verification**: Miners use computational power to verify transactions.
- **Block Creation**: Miners add verified transactions to new blocks on the blockchain.
- **Mining Reward**: Miners receive new bitcoins as a reward for their efforts.

### Mempool
- **Mempool Role**: Acts as a holding area for unconfirmed transactions.
- **Transaction Selection**: Miners pick transactions from the mempool based on fees.

### The Process of Mining
- **Validation and Mining**: Involves validating transactions and solving cryptographic hash problems.
- **Proof of Work**: Miners compete to find a solution to the hash problem, securing the blockchain.

### Competition in Mining
- **Miner Competition**: Miners vie for the block reward and transaction fees.
- **Computational Power**: Greater power increases chances of mining success.
- **Mining Pools**: Collaborative groups formed to increase chances of mining blocks.
- **Difficulty Adjustment**: Ensures consistent block time and fair competition.
