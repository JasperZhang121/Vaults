### Overview

The Chinese stock market is the stock market of the People's Republic of China. It was established as a pilot project in 1989 with the principle of "proceed if the trial goes well, stop if it doesn't."

In the stock market operations prior to 1995, the biggest negative news often involved reports that the stock market trial might be halted or the market could be shut down. However, following the "3.27 Treasury Bond Futures Incident," China’s futures market underwent a comprehensive rectification in 1995, and the stock market became a focus for support. This marked the beginning of a truly positive development phase for China's stock market, leading to a period of significant growth.

One of the most distinctive features of the Chinese stock market is that state-owned shares and corporate shares were not allowed to be traded when listed. Therefore, only circulating shares were traded on the market according to stock prices, while the index was weighted based on the total number of shares. This created the characteristic of "controlling more with less" in stock market operations.

### Trading Rules

#### T+1 Settlement, T+1 Delivery

This means that both parties in a trade complete the transfer of securities and payment on the following day after the transaction. In other words, the buyer receives the securities, and the seller receives the payment the day after the trade. Both the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges implement T+1 settlement for A-shares.

#### Price Fluctuation Limit

To curb excessive speculation and prevent the market from experiencing extreme volatility, stock exchanges set a daily limit on the range that securities prices can fluctuate. In the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges, the price limit is set at 10% based on the previous day's closing price. For ST stocks and S stocks (which have not completed share reform), the limit is 5%. After the pilot registration system on the Growth Enterprise Market (GEM), the price limit was adjusted to 20%.

#### P/E Ratio

A normal range for the **Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio** can vary depending on the industry, the broader market conditions, and the specific company. However, as a general guideline:

- **Normal Range**: Typically, a P/E ratio between **15 and 25** is considered normal for mature, stable companies.
  
- **Lower P/E** (below 15): This could indicate that the stock is undervalued or that the company is experiencing challenges or lower growth expectations.

- **Higher P/E** (above 25): This can suggest that the market expects high future growth, or it could indicate the stock is overvalued.

In the **Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio**, **earnings** refer to a company’s net income or profits, and the P/E ratio formula is as follows:
$$P/E \, Ratio = \frac{Price \, per \, Share}{Earnings \, per \, Share \, (EPS)}$$
Here’s how the **earnings** are calculated:

1. **Net Income (Earnings)**: This is the profit a company makes after all expenses, taxes, and costs have been subtracted from its revenue. It's usually found at the bottom of the income statement, hence the term "bottom line."

2. **Earnings Per Share (EPS)**: This is the net income available to common shareholders divided by the total number of **outstanding shares**. The formula for EPS is:
$$EPS = \frac{Net \, Income}{Total \, Outstanding \, Shares}$$
There are two types of **earnings** often used in P/E calculations:

- **Trailing Twelve Months (TTM) Earnings**: Uses the actual earnings over the last 12 months. This is most commonly used in the standard P/E ratio.
  
- **Forward Earnings**: Estimates future earnings (often for the next 12 months). This is used in the forward P/E ratio, which looks at future expectations of company profits.
##### Example:

- If a company's net income is $100 million and it has 50 million outstanding shares, the **EPS** would be:
$$EPS = \frac{100 \, million}{50 \, million} = 2$$
- If the stock price is $40, the **P/E ratio** would be:
$$P/E = \frac{40}{2} = 20$$
Thus, the earnings used in this context are the **earnings per share (EPS)**.
