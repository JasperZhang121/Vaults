### What are the different boards in China’s stock market?

In the Chinese stock market, there are multiple boards or segments, each catering to different types of companies and investors. Understanding the distinctions between these segments is important for both businesses looking to raise capital and investors making informed decisions. Let’s dive deeper into what each “板” (board) means and the differences between them.

### What does “板” refer to?

The term “板” essentially refers to a <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">trading market</mark>. China's capital markets are divided into on-market and off-market trading platforms. 

- **On-market**: This category includes the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">main boards, SME (Small and Medium-sized Enterprises) board, ChiNext (Growth Enterprise Market), and STAR Market</mark>. Companies listed on these boards are **publicly listed companies**.
  
- **Off-market**: The off-market section includes the New Third Board (全国中小企业股份转让系统), which deals with **non-listed companies**. 

### Understanding the boards

#### 1. **Main Board (主板)**
The Main Board is the most established segment and is often referred to as the **primary market**. It consists of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">large, well-established companies, usually with strong profitability and operational stability</mark>. The **Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE)** and the **Shenzhen Stock Exchange (SZSE)** both have Main Boards. Many of China’s most prominent companies, especially state-owned enterprises (SOEs), are listed here.

- **Key attributes**: 
  - High listing thresholds
  - Companies are generally larger and more mature
  - Represents a major segment of China’s stock market

#### 2. **SME Board (中小板)**
The SME Board is a segment within the <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Shenzhen Stock Exchange</mark> (SZSE), aimed at **small and medium-sized enterprises**. These companies tend to be more mature than those listed on ChiNext but are still smaller in scale than those on the Main Board.

- **Key attributes**: 
  - Focuses on stable, profitable small-to-mid-sized companies
  - Acts as a step between the ChiNext and Main Board

#### 3. **ChiNext (创业板)**
ChiNext, also known as the **Growth Enterprise Market (GEM)**, is China’s equivalent of NASDAQ. It primarily targets **high-tech, high-growth** companies, particularly <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">startups and innovative enterprises</mark>. Companies listed here tend to be smaller and are often in industries such as biotechnology, software, and alternative energy.

- **Key attributes**: 
  - Encourages innovation and supports emerging industries
  - Lower listing thresholds than the Main Board
  - Suitable for companies looking for rapid growth but facing higher risk

#### 4. **STAR Market (科创板)**
The STAR Market was introduced by the **Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE)** to promote technology-driven enterprises. It focuses on companies in **high-tech sectors**, especially those aligned with <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">China’s strategic goals</mark> such as semiconductor development, biotechnology, and AI. It also has a **registration-based IPO system**, which speeds up the listing process compared to traditional markets.

- **Key attributes**: 
  - Targets high-tech companies that align with national strategic interests
  - Supports breakthroughs in core technologies
  - Adopts a registration-based system for faster IPOs

#### 5. **New Third Board (新三板)**
The New Third Board, or **National Equities Exchange and Quotations (NEEQ)**, is a national trading platform aimed at **small and micro-enterprises**. Companies listed here are generally not eligible to be listed on the Main Board, SME Board, or ChiNext, but they can still raise funds and trade shares in a more regulated environment than pure private markets. 

- **Key attributes**: 
  - Caters to small, entrepreneurial companies
  - Provides financing and liquidity for companies not ready for larger boards
  - Off-market, meaning it operates outside traditional exchanges


### Key differences between these boards

#### 1. **Listing Requirements**
Each board has different thresholds for companies to meet in order to list their shares:

- **Main Board**: The highest listing requirements, including profitability and operational history.
- **SME Board**: Lower than the Main Board, but still requires companies to show profitability and stability.
- **ChiNext**: Lower requirements, focusing on potential growth rather than current profitability.
- **STAR Market**: Emphasizes companies with cutting-edge technology, but the registration system lowers the barrier to listing.
- **New Third Board**: Easiest to access, for smaller companies seeking capital but not yet mature enough for the larger boards.

#### 2. **Investment Requirements**
The accessibility for individual investors varies across boards:

- **Main Board & SME Board**: No significant requirements for retail investors.
- **ChiNext**: Requires a minimum of <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">2 years</mark> of stock trading experience, and the investor must hold at least <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">¥100,000</mark> ($15,000 USD) in assets in their trading account for the last 20 trading days.
- **STAR Market**: Higher threshold than ChiNext, requiring a minimum of <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">¥500,000</mark> ($75,000 USD) in assets.
- **New Third Board**: The strictest investment entry requirements, with investors needing <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">¥1,000,000</mark> ($150,000 USD) in assets.

#### 3. **Stock Codes**
Stock codes help investors identify which board a stock belongs to:

- **Main Board (SSE)**: 60XXXX
- **Main Board (SZSE)**: 000XXX
- **SME Board**: 002XXX and 003XXX
- **ChiNext**: 300XXX
- **STAR Market**: 688XXX
- **New Third Board**: 830XXX or 430XXX

#### 4. **Fluctuation Limits**
Different boards have varying rules about the daily stock price fluctuation limits:

- **Main Board & SME Board**: New stocks have a 44% fluctuation cap on the first trading day, with a 10% daily limit afterward.
- **ChiNext & STAR Market**: No fluctuation limits for the first 5 trading days, with a 20% daily cap afterward.
- **New Third Board**: No cap on the first trading day or during delisting periods, with a 30% daily fluctuation cap afterward.


### Key Points

- **Main Board**: Traditional large companies, with the highest listing and investment thresholds.
- **SME Board**: Smaller companies with steady profitability, lower listing thresholds than the Main Board.
- **ChiNext**: High-growth, high-tech startups, with lower barriers for innovation-driven businesses.
- **STAR Market**: Focuses on high-tech and innovative enterprises crucial to China’s development strategies.
- **New Third Board**: A platform for small businesses and startups not ready for larger exchanges but seeking financing.
