The Chinese securities market has a history of more than 120 years, dating back to 1870, and can be divided into three periods: the securities markets of Hong Kong, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Beiping from 1870 to 1949; the markets of Tianjin, Beijing, Hong Kong, and Taiwan from 1950 to 1980; and the markets of Shanghai, Shenzhen, Hong Kong, and Taiwan from 1981 to the present. These periods form three stages in the development of China's securities market.

### 1870–1949
The earliest stocks in Chinese history were issued by foreigners. After the Opium War in 1840, foreign businesses began establishing industrial and commercial enterprises in China and issuing stocks. The first foreign stock exchange was established by the British HSBC Bank, which set up its headquarters in Hong Kong on March 3, 1865, and opened a branch in Shanghai in April of the same year. Around 1870, brokers started buying and selling foreign stocks in China.

At the same time, influenced by the Self-Strengthening Movement, Chinese-owned joint-stock companies and Chinese-issued stocks also emerged. In 1872, Li Hongzhang and Sheng Xuanhuai established the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company in Shanghai and issued stock. In 1882, Shanghai saw the formation of its first securities market, with the creation of the Chinese "Pingtun Stock Company" and the foreign "Stock Brokers' Guild." These were China's earliest institutions specializing in stock trading. In 1891, foreign merchants established the Shanghai Stock Exchange, and in 1902, the Qing government founded the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce. In 1908, the first major stock speculation scandal occurred in China, involving the Rubber Stock Company, which led to significant financial losses for Chinese investors.

The 1911 Revolution, which overthrew the Qing Dynasty, created favorable conditions for the development of national capitalism in China. The First World War distracted imperial powers from controlling the Chinese market, allowing China's national industry and commerce to flourish. The number of joint-stock companies grew, and stock issuance increased, marking a new period in China's securities market.

In 1914, the Shanghai Stock and Commercial Exchange was established, and that December, the Beiyang government issued China's first securities trading regulations. At that time, the exchange had 12 members, and they traded government bonds, railroad bonds, company stocks, and foreign exchange. This was China's first modern securities exchange, fully operated by Chinese nationals.

In 1920, Sun Yat-sen and Yu Qiaqing applied to the Beiyang government to establish the Shanghai Securities and Commodities Exchange, which opened on July 1 of the same year. Meanwhile, the Shanghai Stock and Commercial Exchange was restructured into the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange under new regulations. By 1921, there were more than 200 securities and commodity exchanges in Shanghai alone, and similar exchanges were established in other major cities across China.

### 1950–1980
In 1949, the newly established People's Republic of China shut down most securities exchanges. However, two exchanges—one in Tianjin and one in Beijing—briefly operated in the early 1950s. In Hong Kong, the securities market began to grow steadily after 1949 as capital from mainland China flowed into the city. By 1962, Hong Kong had 65 listed companies, and by 1983, the total market value reached HK$173.45 billion.

In Taiwan, the securities market started in 1953 with the issuance of government bonds and the conversion of land from landlords to peasants through the sale of stock in public enterprises. Taiwan's first formal securities exchange was established in 1962, and the market experienced steady growth, though it remained small compared to international markets.

### 1980–1997

In October 1981, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange elected its first group of members. After three years, the original Hong Kong Stock Exchange, Far East Stock Exchange, Kam Ngan Stock Exchange, and Kowloon Stock Exchange ceased operations, and on April 2, 1986, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange officially opened. It held the exclusive right to establish, operate, and maintain the securities market in Hong Kong, marking a new era for the city's securities market. On September 22, 1986, Hong Kong was accepted as a full member of the International Federation of Stock Exchanges, stepping into the international financial market. At that time, Hong Kong had 258 listed companies and 330 types of securities, including 260 ordinary shares, 21 warrants, 7 corporate bonds, 1 government bond, 36 unit trusts, and 5 preferred shares. By 1987, the Hang Seng Index had reached nearly 4,000 points, but a global stock market crash, triggered by a sharp drop in the U.S. stock market, caused the Hang Seng Index to fall to 1,894.94 points on December 7, 1987. It recovered to 3,500 points by 1990. Despite various external influences in the 1990s, the Hong Kong stock market demonstrated strong resilience. The Hang Seng Index reached 12,000 points in 1992, and by January 1997, there were 550 listed companies in Hong Kong, with a total of 624 securities, including 16 funds, 36 warrants, 22 Chinese H-shares, and 9 industry categories such as conglomerates, shipping, hotels and restaurants, financial investment, real estate, retail and media, electronics and toys, industrials, and utilities.

In Taiwan, the stock market index fluctuated between 400 and 500 points in the early 1980s, but it climbed to 1,039.11 points by 1986. It then surged, reaching 4,673 points in 1987, 8,789 points in 1988, 10,773 points in 1989, and 12,495 points in 1990. However, the market crashed in 1990, dropping from 12,682 points in February to 2,485 points in October, a decline of 80%. By the end of the year, the index recovered to 4,530 points. At that time, 355 securities companies in Taiwan suffered varying degrees of losses.

One of the most notable developments from the 1980s to the 1990s was the establishment and growth of the Shenzhen and Shanghai stock markets. This led to the formation of four securities markets in China: Shenzhen, Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Taiwan.

In 1981, the Chinese government began issuing treasury bonds, and in July 1984, Beijing Tianqiao Co., Ltd. and Shanghai Feilo Acoustics Co., Ltd. publicly issued stocks with the approval of the People's Bank of China. This marked the initial phase of the securities market since China's reform and opening-up in 1979. By 1989, more than 6,000 companies across the country had issued stocks, with a cumulative total of 3.5 billion RMB. Over 100 companies were involved in regulated pilot stock issuance. In addition to stocks, the Shenyang Trust Investment Company pioneered bond trading and mortgage business on May 8, 1986. By 1988, 61 major and medium-sized cities had opened treasury bond circulation markets. In 1990, over 400 trading institutions across more than 100 cities offered treasury bond transfer services, and China issued over 210 billion RMB in securities, with a cumulative transaction volume of 31.8 billion RMB. On November 26, 1990, the Shanghai Stock Exchange was established, and in December, the Automated Quotation System (STAQ) was put into operation. On July 3, 1991, the Shenzhen Stock Exchange began operations, signaling the launch phase of China's securities market.

In September 1986, the Jingan branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Trust and Investment Company began over-the-counter stock trading, primarily involving Feilo Acoustics and Yanzhong Industrial Co., Ltd. In 1988, three securities companies, Haitong, Wanguo, and Zhenxing, were established in Shanghai, initially forming an over-the-counter securities market. By 1990, eight stocks, including Yanzhong Industrial, Vacuum Electronics, Feilo Acoustics, and Phoenix Chemical, were being traded on the Shanghai market. These stocks were known as the "old eight stocks." When the Shanghai Stock Exchange was established in 1991, apart from the old eight stocks, there were three types of 1989 inflation-linked government bonds, four treasury bonds from 1987 to 1991, six bonds from the Industrial and Commercial Bank, one bond each from the Bank of Communications and the Bank of China, and 14 corporate bonds such as those from Shanghai Petrochemical and Chlor-Alkali Chemical. The Shenzhen securities market, which started in 1987, had five publicly traded stocks by 1990, including stocks from Vanke and Shenzhen Development, and 12 securities companies with 16 business outlets. Unlike Shanghai, Shenzhen's main trading products were stocks, not bonds.

In May 1992, Shanghai and Shenzhen began formal, standardized stock trading. The composite indices of the two markets reached 1,429 points and 312 points, respectively, before falling back to 386 points and 164 points by November. By the end of 1992, the Shanghai Stock Exchange had 29 A-shares and 9 B-shares listed, while the Shenzhen Stock Exchange had 23 A-shares and 9 B-shares listed. By February 1993, the indices of the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets had risen to 1,558 points and 369 points, respectively, and many new stocks were listed. By the end of 1993, the Shanghai Stock Exchange had 107 A-shares, 22 B-shares, and 5 types of treasury bonds listed, while the Shenzhen Stock Exchange had 76 A-shares and 19 B-shares. On July 29, 1994, due to expansion pressures, the indices of the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets fell to 325 points and 94 points, respectively. In response, the management proposed three policies, including suspending new stock issuance. By September, the indices rebounded to 1,052 points and 210 points, respectively. By the end of 1994, the Shanghai Stock Exchange had 168 A-shares, 32 B-shares, 10 funds, 5 treasury bonds, and 10 futures listed. The Shenzhen Stock Exchange had 118 A-shares, 18 B-shares, 8 funds, and 15 treasury bond futures.

In early 1995, a large influx of funds into the treasury bond futures market caused the indices of the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets to drop to 524 points and 122 points, respectively. On May 18, the State Council announced the suspension of treasury bond futures trading and penalized violating securities firms, causing the indices to rise to 927 points and 175 points (component index 1,473 points) within three days. By the end of 1995, there were 460 listed securities on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets, with a cumulative annual transaction volume of 6.4 trillion RMB. The Shanghai Stock Exchange had 184 A-shares, 35 B-shares, 12 funds, 6 treasury bonds, 14 futures, and 8 treasury bond repos listed. The Shenzhen Stock Exchange had 127 A-shares, 34 B-shares, 10 funds, 6 treasury bonds, 14 futures, and 7 treasury bond repos listed.

In early 1996, the indices of the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets hovered around 522 points and 104 points, respectively. However, with the improvement of the macroeconomy, the return of Hong Kong in 1997, and the upcoming 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the indices of the two markets quickly rose. By December 11 and 12, they had reached 1,258 points (30-stock index 3,064 points) and 476 points (component index 4,522 points), respectively. By the end of 1996, the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets had 667 listed securities and an annual transaction volume of 41.61 trillion RMB. The Shanghai Stock Exchange had 287 A-shares, 42 B-shares, 15 funds, 9 treasury bonds, and 8 treasury bond repos listed, while the Shenzhen Stock Exchange had 227 A-shares, 43 B-shares, 10 funds, 9 treasury bonds, and 9 treasury bond repos listed.

By May 1997, the indices of the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets had reached 1,510 points (30-stock index 4,286 points) and 520 points (component index 6,130 points), respectively. By October 1, 1997, there were 361 A-shares and 48 B-shares listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, and 336 A-shares and 51 B-shares listed on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange. The development of the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets had garnered significant attention from the global financial community, especially after the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China proposed reforms through the development of a stock system, allowing the securities market to further realize its financing and capital-raising functions.
