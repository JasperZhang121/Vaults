### Auction

On July 1, 2006, the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges implemented an open call auction system. During the call auction period, the real-time market data, including reference prices, is continuously displayed. The call auction times for both the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges are from 9:15 AM to 9:25 AM, and from 2:57 PM to 3:00 PM. The real-time market data includes information such as stock code, stock name, previous closing price, reference opening price, virtual matching volume, and unmatched volume. From 9:15 AM to 9:20 AM, orders can be submitted and canceled; from 9:20 AM to 9:25 AM, orders can be submitted but not canceled.

The main purpose of the call auction is to determine the opening price. Afterward, the stock market enters the continuous trading phase, where continuous auctioning takes place. Buy and sell orders that were not executed during the call auction remain valid and are automatically carried into the continuous auction phase to wait for a suitable price for execution. Investors across the country continue to submit buy and sell orders, and the computer systems at the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges continuously match these valid orders for execution. Invalid orders, such as those exceeding the price fluctuation limits, are rejected (except for newly listed stocks on their first day).

Specifically, during the call auction, multiple orders or all orders within a specific time frame are aggregated. A transaction price is determined based on the principle of not exceeding the highest bid price and not falling below the lowest ask price. The price at which the maximum number of shares can be traded becomes the transaction price for all matched orders. 

The call auction occurs before the market officially opens. Investors input their stock prices based on the previous day's closing price and their predictions for the day's market during the call auction period. The system calculates the price that can generate the highest transaction volume, which becomes the call auction transaction price. After 9:25 AM, investors can see the transaction prices and volumes of the stocks involved in the call auction. If no transaction occurs for a stock due to mismatched buy and sell prices, the transaction price column for that stock remains empty after 9:25 AM. Additionally, if a company is temporarily halted due to news announcements or a shareholders' meeting, the transaction price column will also be empty during the call auction.

Because the call auction is conducted at the price that results in the highest transaction volume, regular investors can execute their orders as long as their bid price is above the actual transaction price. However, if they set their buy order at the upper price limit or sell at the lower limit, they are guaranteed a higher priority for execution. Therefore, small investors who wish to prioritize their orders during the call auction can submit a higher price to secure priority, though the final transaction price will still be the lower auction price. Since small investors generally do not trade large volumes, their orders typically do not significantly influence the call auction price for a stock.

### Meeting the Conditions

In a call auction, the computer trading system ranks all orders according to the principles of price priority and time priority. Based on this, it identifies a reference price that simultaneously meets the following three conditions:

1. **Maximum transaction volume**.
2. **All buy orders above the reference price and all sell orders below the reference price are fully satisfied** (i.e., executed).
3. **For orders at the reference price, either all buy or all sell orders are fully satisfied** (i.e., executed).

This reference price is then set as the transaction price. The entire process of determining the transaction price in a call auction is fully automated by the computer trading system, which displays the resulting transaction price.

There are a few key points to note:

1. Under the call auction method, the principles of price priority and time priority are reflected in the way the system ranks all buy and sell orders from highest to lowest price. For orders at the same price, the system ranks them based on the time the orders were received by the system.
   
2. If more than one price meets the three conditions during the call auction, the **Shanghai Stock Exchange** selects the price with the smallest unfulfilled order volume (the absolute difference between cumulative buy and cumulative sell orders). If two or more prices result in the same smallest unfulfilled volume, the middle price is chosen as the transaction price. The **Shenzhen Stock Exchange**, however, chooses the price closest to the previous closing price as the transaction price.

The phrase "selecting the price with the smallest unfulfilled volume" means that after transactions occur at the reference price, the remaining unexecuted order volume is minimized. In other words, the transaction price is determined by minimizing the absolute difference between cumulative buy and cumulative sell orders.


### Relevant Regulations

#### Declaration Rules
- Each trading day, from <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">9:15 to 9:25</mark> and from <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">14:57 to 15:00</mark>, the trading host accepts bidding orders.
- From 9:25 to 9:30 each trading day, the trading host only accepts orders but does not process buy, sell, or cancellation requests. The exchange may adjust the declaration time when necessary.

#### Order Cancellation Rules
- Before an order is executed, the trader has the right to modify or cancel the order. If the order has been partially executed, the executed portion cannot be canceled.
- The call auction phase refers primarily to the time period from <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">9:20 to 9:25</mark> on trading days. During this phase, neither the Shanghai nor the Shenzhen markets accept cancellations.
- It is important for investors to note that during other times when trading declarations are accepted, the rules in the Shanghai and Shenzhen markets differ. In Shanghai, unexecuted orders can be canceled during the order acceptance period:
  - From 9:15 to 9:20, the trading host can accept buy, sell, and cancellation orders, but no transactions or cancellations are processed.
  - From 9:20 to 9:25 and 14:57 to 15:00, the trading host does not accept cancellation orders for bidding.

#### Bidding Range
**Shanghai Market**:
- For securities without price fluctuation limits, valid declaration prices during the call auction must meet the following requirements:
  1. The stock trading declaration price cannot exceed 200% of the previous closing price and must not be lower than 50% of the previous closing price.
  2. For funds and bonds, the highest declaration price must not exceed 150% of the previous closing price and must not be lower than 70% of the previous closing price. There are no price limits for bond repurchase transactions during the call auction phase.

**Shenzhen Market**:
1. For securities with price fluctuation limits, the valid bidding range during the call auction matches the price fluctuation limit range.
2. For securities without price fluctuation limits, the valid bidding range is determined as follows:
   1. On the first day of a stock listing, the valid bidding range during the opening call auction is within 900% of the issue price. The valid range for continuous bidding and closing call auctions is within 10% of the most recent transaction price.
   2. For bonds on their first listing day, the valid bidding range during the opening call auction is within 30% of the issue price, and the valid range for continuous bidding and closing call auctions is within 10% of the most recent transaction price. For bonds not listed on their first day, the valid range during the opening call auction is within 10% of the previous closing price, and the valid range for continuous bidding and closing call auctions is within 10% of the most recent transaction price.
   3. For bond pledged repurchases not listed on their first day, the valid bidding range during the opening call auction is within 100% of the previous closing price, and the valid range for continuous bidding and closing call auctions is within 100% of the most recent transaction price.

#### System
The open call auction system refers to the method where real-time market information, such as reference prices, is disclosed during the call auction phase. According to the new trading rules, the open call auction is divided into two types: the **opening open call auction** and the **closing open call auction**, depending on the time of trading.

Call auction means that before the official market opens, investors who wish to participate in the market can input stock prices based on the previous day's closing price and their predictions for the day's market. The trading system calculates transaction volumes for each price level based on the principles of price priority and time priority, and the price with the highest transaction volume is set as the call auction price. This call auction price becomes the opening price for the stock, and the entire process is referred to as a **call auction**.

### Call Auction Demonstration

During the call auction for a stock, the buy and sell orders are shown in Table 1. The stock's previous closing price was 10.13 CNY.

#### Table 1: Buy and Sell Orders during Call Auction

| Buy Quantity (Lots) | Price (CNY) | Sell Quantity (Lots) |
|---------------------|-------------|----------------------|
| —                   | 10.50       | 100                  |

There are two price levels with the maximum executable volume of 300 lots: 10.10 CNY and 10.20 CNY. On the Shanghai Stock Exchange, the mid-price 10.15 CNY would be selected as the transaction price. On the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, the price closest to the previous closing price (10.13 CNY), which is 10.10 CNY, would be selected.

The order queue after the call auction is shown in Table 3.

### Auction Procedure

#### Step 1: Determine Valid Orders
In cases where there are price fluctuation limits, valid orders are determined as follows: based on the previous trading day's closing price and the allowable price fluctuation range for the security, the highest and lowest price limits for the day are calculated. The valid price range includes all price levels between the highest and lowest price limits for that security. <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Orders placed outside this range are considered invalid and will be automatically canceled</mark> by the system.

#### Step 2: Select the Transaction Price
Within the valid price range, the system selects the price that results in the maximum transaction volume for all orders. If there are two or more such prices, the following rules are used to select the transaction price:
1. All buy orders above the selected price and all sell orders below the selected price must be fully executed.
2. Orders at the selected price must be fully executed on one side (either all buy or all sell orders). If there are still multiple price levels that meet these conditions, the price closest to the previous day's closing price will be chosen as the transaction price.

#### Step 3: Centralized Matching
All buy orders are sorted by their limit prices from high to low, with <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">orders at the same price ranked by the time</mark> they entered the system. Similarly, all sell orders are sorted by their limit prices from low to high, with the same rule for time priority applied. Orders are matched sequentially, with the front-most buy and sell orders being paired first. Transactions are executed in the order of "price priority, time priority at the same price," and this process continues until the conditions for matching are no longer met—that is, when there are no buy orders with a limit price equal to or higher than the transaction price, or no sell orders with a limit price equal to or lower than the transaction price. All transactions are executed at the same transaction price.

#### Step 4: Market Information Disclosure
1. If no transaction volume occurs for the security, the system displays the opening price, latest transaction price, highest price, and lowest price, along with the transaction volume and transaction amount.
2. Among the remaining valid orders, the highest actual bid price is displayed as the bid price, and if no valid bid exists, the bid price field is shown as empty. Similarly, the lowest actual ask price is displayed as the ask price, and if no valid ask exists, the ask price field is shown as empty. Any unexecuted orders from the call auction are automatically carried over to the continuous auction phase.
