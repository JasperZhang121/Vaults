- **Primary Market:**
    
    - **Definition:** The part of the capital market where <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">new securities are issued to the public for the first time.</mark>
        
    - **Function:** Helps companies, governments, and other entities raise fresh capital from the public.
        
    - **Key Mechanisms:**
        
        1. **Initial Public Offering (IPO):**
            - A company's first sale of stock to the public.
            - **Example:** When Facebook went public in 2012, it conducted an IPO to sell shares of its stock for the first time to the public. This allowed Facebook to raise a significant amount of capital.
        2. **Rights Issue (or Rights Offering):**
            - Existing shareholders are given the right to purchase additional shares at a discounted price.
            - **Example:** A company that's already public may need more funds for expansion. Instead of selling shares to the general public, they can offer existing shareholders the chance to buy more shares at a discounted rate.
        3. **Private Placement:**
            - Selling securities directly to an institutional investor like a bank, mutual fund, or insurance company.
            - **Example:** If a company doesn't want to go public yet but needs funds, <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">it might sell shares or bonds directly to a pension fund or venture capital firm</mark>.
    - **Advantages:** Allows entities to access a wide pool of investors, diversify their ownership base, and get the capital without increasing their debt.
        
- **Secondary Market:**
    
    - **Definition:** A market where securities, previously issued in the primary market, are bought and sold.
        
    - **Function:** Provides a platform for investors to sell their investments and exit, thus ensuring liquidity. It also plays a role in price discovery based on the ongoing demand and supply of the securities.
        
    - **Key Mechanisms:**
        
        1. **Stock Exchanges:**
            - Organized and regulated markets where securities are bought and sold.
            - **Examples:**
                - **NYSE (New York Stock Exchange):** One of the world's largest stock exchanges. Blue-chip companies, like IBM and Coca-Cola, are listed here.
                - **Nasdaq:** Known for its electronic trading platform and has many tech companies listed, like Apple and Amazon.
        2. **Over-The-Counter (OTC) Market:**
            - A decentralized market where trading occurs directly between two parties without a central exchange.
            - **Example:** <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Smaller companies that may not meet the listing requirements</mark> of larger exchanges might trade in the OTC markets.
    - **Advantages:** Offers liquidity to investors, helps in price discovery based on real-time trading data, and provides opportunities for diverse investment strategies (like day trading or long-term investing).
