- **Overview of Capital Market:** The capital market is an integral segment of the financial system where both individuals and institutions participate to trade long-term financial instruments. Unlike short-term instruments traded in the money market, the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">capital market focuses on assets designed for long-term investment</mark>. These assets or securities can be debt-based, equity-based, or hybrid instruments. The capital market plays a pivotal role in the national economy, fostering capital formation and directing the flow of wealth between savers and those requiring funds for various endeavors, such as infrastructure projects, business expansions, and more.
    
- **Purpose and Function:**
    
    1. **Capital Formation:** One of the primary functions of the capital market is to facilitate the process of capital formation. This means it helps channel savings and investments in the economy in a way that funds are directed towards productive uses. When companies or governments need money for long-term projects, they can raise it by issuing securities in the capital market.
        
    2. **Liquidity Function:** While the focus of the capital market is on long-term securities, it also ensures that these securities can be quickly converted into cash if needed. This is particularly true in the secondary market, where securities are traded post their initial issuance.
        
    3. **Price Discovery:** The capital market provides a transparent platform where securities are bought and sold. Based on <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">supply and demand dynamics</mark>, it helps in determining the fair market price of these securities. This function is crucial as it provides signals to both companies and investors about the valuation of assets.
        
    4. **Risk Diversification:** Through <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">a wide variety of financial instruments and derivatives available in the capital market</mark>, investors can spread out and manage their risks. For instance, by diversifying investments across sectors or regions, the impact of a poor-performing asset can be mitigated.
        
    5. **Economic Barometer:** The health of the capital market, often gauged by the performance of key stock indices, can be an indicator of the overall economic health and investor sentiment. When the capital market is bullish, it often indicates positive sentiment about economic growth, and vice-versa.

- **Example**
	- **Capital Formation:**
	    
	    - **Example:** In the early 2010s, many renewable energy companies issued stocks and bonds in capital markets to finance the development and deployment of solar and wind energy technologies.
	- **Liquidity Function:**
	    
	    - **Example:** Consider an investor who bought Amazon stocks in the early 2000s. Over time, as the company grew, so did the stock's value. If the investor decides to buy a house in 2023, they can easily sell these stocks in the secondary market and convert them into cash.
	- **Price Discovery:**
	    
	    - **Example:** When Twitter went public in 2013, there was significant demand for its shares. The buying and selling activities on the first day and subsequent days helped determine its fair market price based on investor interest and sentiment.
	- **Risk Diversification:**
	    
	    - **Example:** An investor might choose to invest in a diversified mutual fund that has holdings in tech, pharmaceuticals, real estate, and international markets. If the tech sector faces a slump, the strong performance of the other sectors can offset losses, illustrating risk diversification.
	- **Economic Barometer:**
	    
	    - **Example:** In the financial crisis of 2008, stock indices like the Dow Jones and S&P 500 plummeted, indicating severe economic distress and negative investor sentiment. Conversely, in periods of economic boom, these indices often reach record highs, reflecting positive sentiment and economic health.
