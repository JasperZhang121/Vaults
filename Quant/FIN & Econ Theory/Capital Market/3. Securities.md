- **Equity Securities (Stocks):**
    
    - **Definition:** Instruments that signify ownership in a corporation and represent a proportionate claim on its assets and profits.
        
    - **Characteristics:**
        
        1. **Dividend Payments:** Companies may <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">distribute a portion of their profits to shareholders</mark> in the form of dividends. However, dividends are not guaranteed.
        2. **Voting Rights:** Common stockholders often have the right to vote on major corporate decisions.
        3. **Residual Claimant:** In case of liquidation, common stockholders have the right to company assets after all debts and other obligations are paid.
    - **Types:**
        
        1. **Common Stocks:** Standard equity shares that may provide dividends and carry voting rights.
        2. **Preferred Stocks:** These often come with a fixed dividend rate and have a higher claim on assets and earnings than common stocks. They typically <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">do not have voting rights</mark>.
    - **Example:** When an individual buys shares of Apple Inc., they become a part-owner of the company, sharing in its potential profits (through dividends) and growth (through appreciation in stock price).
        
- **Debt Securities (Bonds):**
    
    - **Definition:** Financial instruments indicating the issuer owes the holders a debt. Typically, the issuer is obligated to pay interest and return the principal amount at maturity.
        
    - **Characteristics:**
        
        1. **Fixed Income:** Bonds typically pay <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">a fixed interest, often termed as 'coupon'</mark>, at regular intervals.
        2. **Maturity Date:** The date on which the principal amount is returned to bondholders.
        3. **Credit Rating:** Agencies like Moody's and S&P provide ratings to bonds based on their <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">creditworthiness</mark>.
    - **Types:**
        
        1. **Corporate Bonds:** Issued by corporations to raise capital for business expansion or other needs.
        2. **Municipal Bonds:** Issued by municipalities, often tax-exempt.
        3. **Government Bonds:** Issued by national governments. In the U.S., these are called Treasuries.
    - **Example:** If a city wants to build a new bridge and needs financing, it might issue municipal bonds. Investors buying these bonds would receive regular interest payments and get back the principal amount at the end of the bond's term.
        
- **Derivative Securities:**
    
    - **Definition:** Financial instruments derived from other forms of assets like stocks, bonds, commodities, or even other derivatives.
        
    - **Characteristics:**
        
        1. **Leverage:** Small movements in the underlying asset can result in large profits or losses due to the leveraged nature of derivatives.
        2. **Speculation & Hedging:** Used for both speculative purposes (betting on price movements) and hedging (protecting against potential price movements).
    - **Types:**
        
        1. **Options:** Contracts <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">offering the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call option) or sell (put option)</mark> an asset at a predetermined price within a specific time frame.
        2. **Futures:** Standardized contracts <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">obligating the buyer to purchase, and the seller to sell, a specific quantity of an asset at a predetermined price</mark> on a specified future date.
    - **Example:** A farmer expects to harvest his crop in 3 months but fears a price drop. To secure a price now, he enters into a futures contract to sell his crop at a predetermined price in 3 months.

-  **Futures: Mechanics & Process:**
    
    1. **Initiating a Futures Position:** To enter into a futures contract, a trader doesn't need to pay the full value of the contract upfront. Instead, they're required to deposit a fraction of the total contract value, known as the **initial margin**. This acts as a good-faith deposit.
        
    2. **Marking to Market:** At the end of each trading day, the futures contract is marked to its market price, and the accounts of the parties in the contract are adjusted accordingly. If the market moves against a position, the holder will have a loss, and if the movement is beyond the initial margin, they might receive a **margin call** from the broker, requiring them to deposit additional money to bring the account back to the initial margin level. Conversely, if the market moves in favor, the account will show a profit.
        
    3. **Settlement:** Futures contracts can be settled in two ways:
        
        - **Physical Delivery:** The underlying asset of the futures contract is <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">actually delivered</mark> by the seller to the buyer. For example, in the case of agricultural commodities, the physical goods can be delivered.
            
        - **Cash Settlement:** Most futures contracts these days are cash-settled. T<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">he parties settle by paying (or receiving) the difference between the agreed-upon price and the market price at the contract's expiration</mark>.
            
    4. **Exiting a Position:** A trader can <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">exit their position before the expiration date by taking an offsetting position</mark>. For example, if a trader is in a long position (agreed to buy), they can offset by selling the same futures contract.
        
- **Risks & Considerations:**
    
    - **Leverage Risk:** Because of the margin system, futures trading is highly leveraged. A small price movement can lead to a significant profit or loss compared to the initial margin deposit.
        
    - **Liquidity Risk:** Some futures contracts might not be very liquid, leading to larger bid-ask spreads or difficulty in closing a position.
        
    - **Basis Risk:** This is the risk that arises from the difference between the spot price (current market price) and the futures price.
        
- **Example with Deposit Mechanism:** Suppose a trader enters into a futures contract to buy one gold bar (about 400 oz) in six months at $2,000 per ounce. The total value of the contract is $800,000 (400 oz x $2,000). The futures exchange might set an initial margin of 5%, so the trader deposits $40,000. If gold prices rise to $2,050 per ounce the next day, the trader gains $20,000 (50 x 400), which gets added to their margin account. Conversely, if the price drops to $1,950, their account would be debited $20,000. If this brings their margin below a certain threshold, say $30,000, they will receive a margin call and must deposit additional funds.

    2. **Put Option:** Grants the holder the right to sell the underlying asset.
        
- **Styles of Options:**
    
    1. **European Options:**
        - **Definition:** Can only be exercised at the expiration date, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not before</mark>.
        - **Advantages:** Typically <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">less expensive</mark> than American options because of the restriction on exercise timing.
        - **Use Cases:** These are often used in standardized markets and are common in index options.
    2. **American Options:**
        - **Definition:** Can be exercised any time <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">between the purchase date and the expiration date</mark>.

- **Valuation:** The value of an option is derived from various factors, including the price of the underlying asset, the strike price of the option, the time until expiration, the volatility of the underlying asset, and the risk-free interest rate. Various models, like the Black-Scholes model, are used to estimate option prices.
    
- **Usage:** Options can be used for various purposes, including hedging against price movements in the underlying asset, speculating on future price movements, or capturing potential dividends.
