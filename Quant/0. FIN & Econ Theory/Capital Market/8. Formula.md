### Valuation & Returns:
- **Simple Return**: Measures the change in value of an investment over a period of time, including dividends.
  - $$R = \frac{P_{\text{end}} - P_{\text{begin}} + \text{Dividends}}{P_{\text{begin}}}$$
  - Where:
    - $R$: Simple return
    - $P_{\text{begin}}$: Initial price of the investment
    - $P_{\text{end}}$: Final price of the investment
    - $\text{Dividends}$: Total dividends received

- **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate)**: Measures the mean annual growth rate of an investment over a specified period of time.
  - $$CAGR = \left( \frac{\text{Ending Value}}{\text{Beginning Value}} \right)^{\frac{1}{\text{Number of Years}}} - 1$$
  - Where:
    - $CAGR$: Compound annual growth rate
    - $\text{Ending Value}$: Value of investment at the end of the period
    - $\text{Beginning Value}$: Value of investment at the beginning of the period
    - $\text{Number of Years}$: Number of years over which the investment has grown

- **Dividend Discount Model**: Used to estimate the value of a stock based on the present value of its future dividends.
  - $$P_0 = \frac{D_1}{r - g}$$
  - Where:
    - $P_0$: Current stock price
    - $D_1$: Expected dividend per share next period
    - $r$: Required rate of return
    - $g$: Growth rate of dividends

### Risk & Volatility:
- **Variance**: Measures the dispersion of returns from its mean.
  - $$\sigma^2 = \frac{\sum(P_i - P_{\text{avg}})^2}{n}$$
  - Where:
    - $\sigma^2$: Variance
    - $P_i$: Individual prices
    - $P_{\text{avg}}$: Average price
    - $n$: Number of observations

- **Standard Deviation**: Square root of variance, representing the volatility of an investment.
  - $$\sigma = \sqrt{\sigma^2}$$

- **Beta**: Measures the volatility of a security or portfolio in relation to the market.
  - $$\beta = \frac{\text{Covariance(Stock Return, Market Return)}}{\text{Variance(Market Return)}}$$

### Bonds & Fixed Income Securities:
- **YTM (Yield to Maturity) for zero-coupon bonds**: The rate of return anticipated on a bond if held until maturity, assuming all coupon and principal payments are made as scheduled.
  - $$YTM = \left( \frac{\text{Face Value}}{\text{Current Price}} \right)^{\frac{1}{\text{Number of Years to Maturity}}} - 1$$

- **Current Yield**: The annual income (interest or dividends) divided by the current price of the security.
  - $$\text{Current Yield} = \frac{\text{Annual Coupon Payments}}{\text{Bond Price}}$$

### Cost of Capital:
- **WACC (Weighted Average Cost of Capital)**: The average rate of return a company is expected to pay to all its security holders to finance its assets.
  - $$WACC = w_d \times r_d \times (1-T_c) + w_p \times r_p + w_e \times r_e$$
  - Where:
    - $w_d, w_p, w_e$: Proportion of debt, preferred equity, and common equity in the capital structure
    - $r_d, r_p, r_e$: Cost of debt, preferred equity, and common equity
    - $T_c$: Corporate tax rate

### CAPM (Capital Asset Pricing Model):
- **Expected Return**: The return on a security or portfolio expected to compensate the investor for the level of risk undertaken.
  - $$E(R_i) = R_f + \beta_i \times (E(R_m) - R_f)$$
  - Where:
    - $E(R_i)$: Expected return on security or portfolio
    - $R_f$: Risk-free rate
    - $\beta_i$: Beta of the security or portfolio
    - $E(R_m)$: Expected return on the market portfolio
