1. **Covered Call:**
    
    - Selling a call option on an asset you own.
    - Used to generate additional income on a stock position.
    - Risk: You miss out on large upside if the stock surges beyond the strike price.
2. **Protective Put:**
    
    - Buying a put option on an asset you own.
    - Acts as an insurance policy, allowing you to sell the stock at a set price, even if it drops drastically.
    - Protects against downside risk.
3. **Bull Spread:**
    
    - Implemented by buying a call option at a particular strike price and selling another call option at a higher strike price (same expiration date).
    - Profits from moderately rising stock prices.
4. **Bear Spread:**
    
    - Buying a put at a higher strike price and selling another put at a lower strike price (same expiration).
    - Profits from moderately declining stock prices.
5. **Straddle:**
    
    - Buying a call and put option with the same strike price and expiration date.
    - Used when significant movement is expected but unsure of direction.
    - Profits if the stock makes a big move in either direction.
6. **Strangle:**
    
    - Similar to straddle but purchases out-of-the-money call and put options.
    - Cheaper than straddle but requires a bigger price movement to profit.
7. **Butterfly Spread:**
    
    - Combination of a bull spread and a bear spread.
    - Involves three strike prices. Buy a lower strike call, sell two middle strike calls, and buy an upper strike call.
    - Profits in a limited range but offers higher returns within that range.
8. **Iron Condor:**
    
    - Combination of a bull put spread and a bear call spread.
    - Four options: sell an out-of-the-money call, buy a farther out-of-the-money call, sell an out-of-the-money put, and buy a farther out-of-the-money put.
    - Profits in a limited price range. Often used when little movement is expected.
9. **Collar:**
    
    - Combining a covered call and a protective put.
    - Caps both potential profit and loss. Protects against downside but also limits upside potential.
10. **Calendar Spread (Horizontal Spread):**
    

- Buying a long-term option and selling a short-term option with the same strike price.
- Profits from time decay difference between short-term and long-term options.
