   - Buying a put at a higher strike price and selling another put at a lower strike price (same expiration).

### Straddle:
   - Buying a call and put option with the same strike price and expiration date.

   - Profits if the stock makes a big move in either direction.

   - Similar to a straddle but purchases out-of-the-money call and put options.
   - Cheaper than a straddle but requires a bigger price movement to profit.

### Butterfly Spread:
   - Combination of a bull spread and a bear spread.
   - Involves three strike prices. Buy a lower strike call, sell two middle strike calls, and buy an upper strike call.
   - Profits in a limited range but offers higher returns within that range.

### Iron Condor:
   - Combination of a bull put spread and a bear call spread.
   - Involves four options: sell an out-of-the-money call, buy a farther out-of-the-money call, sell an out-of-the-money put, and buy a farther out-of-the-money put.
   - Profits in a limited price range. Often used when little movement is expected.

### Collar:
   - Combining a covered call and a protective put.
   - Caps both potential profit and loss. Protects against downside but also limits upside potential.

### Calendar Spread (Horizontal Spread):
-  Buying a long-term option and selling a short-term option with the same strike price.
-  Profits from the time decay difference between short-term and long-term options.
