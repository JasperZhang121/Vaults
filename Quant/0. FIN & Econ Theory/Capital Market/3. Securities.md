### Equity Securities (Stocks):

- **Definition:** Instruments that signify <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">ownership in a corporation and represent a proportionate claim on its assets and profits</mark>.

- **Characteristics:**
  1. **Dividend Payments:** Companies may distribute a portion of their profits to shareholders in the form of dividends. However, dividends are <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">not guaranteed</mark>.
  2. **Voting Rights:** Common stockholders often have the right to <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">vote on major corporate decisions</mark>.
  3. **Residual Claimant:** In case of liquidation, common stockholders have the right to company <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">assets after all debts and other obligations are paid</mark>.

- **Types:**
  1. **Common Stocks:** Standard equity shares that may provide dividends and carry voting rights.
  2. **Preferred Stocks:** These often come with <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">a fixed dividend rate</mark> and have a <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">higher claim</mark> on assets and earnings than common stocks. They typically do not have voting rights.

- **Example:** When an individual buys shares of Apple Inc., they become a part-owner of the company, sharing in its potential profits (through dividends) and growth (through appreciation in stock price).

### Debt Securities (Bonds):

- **Definition:** Financial instruments indicating the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">issuer owes the holders a debt</mark>. Typically, the issuer is obligated to pay interest and return the principal amount at maturity.

- **Characteristics:**
  1. **Fixed Income:** Bonds typically pay a fixed interest, often termed as 'coupon', at regular intervals.
  2. **Maturity Date:** The date on which the principal amount is returned to bondholders.
  3. **Credit Rating:** Agencies like Moody's and S&P provide <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">ratings to bonds based on their creditworthiness</mark>.

- **Types:**
  1. **Corporate Bonds:** Issued by corporations to raise capital for business expansion or other needs.
  2. **Municipal Bonds:** Issued by municipalities, often tax-exempt.
  3. **Government Bonds:** Issued by national governments. In the U.S., these are called Treasuries.

- **Example:** If a city wants to build a new bridge and needs financing, it might issue municipal bonds. Investors buying these bonds would receive regular interest payments and get back the principal amount at the end of the bond's term.

### Derivative Securities:

- **Definition:** Financial instruments <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">derived from other forms of assets like stocks, bonds, commodities, or even other derivatives</mark>.

- **Characteristics:**
  1. **Leverage:** Small movements in the underlying asset can result in large profits or losses due to the leveraged nature of derivatives.
  2. **Speculation & Hedging:** Used for both <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">speculative</mark> purposes (betting on price movements) and <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">hedging</mark> (protecting against potential price movements).

- **Types:**
  1. **Options:** Contracts offering the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call option) or sell (put option) an asset <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">at a predetermined price within a specific time frame</mark>.
  2. **Futures:** Standardized contracts <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">obligating</mark> the buyer to purchase, and the seller to sell, a specific quantity of an asset at a predetermined price on a specified future date.

- **Example:** A farmer expects to harvest his crop in 3 months but fears a price drop. To secure a price now, he enters into a futures contract to sell his crop at a predetermined price in 3 months.

### Futures - Mechanics & Process:

1. **Initiating a Futures Position:**
   - To enter into a futures contract, a trader doesn't need to pay the full value of the contract upfront. Instead, they're required to <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">deposit a fraction of the total contract value, known as the initial margin</mark>. This acts as a good-faith deposit.

2. **Marking to Market:**
   - At the end of each trading day, the futures contract is marked to its market price, and the accounts of the parties in the contract are adjusted accordingly. If the market moves against a position, the holder will have a loss, and if the movement is beyond the initial margin, they might receive a margin call from the broker, requiring them to deposit additional money to bring the account back to the initial margin level. Conversely, if the market moves in favor, the account will show a profit.

3. **Settlement:**
   - Futures contracts can be settled in two ways:
     - **Physical Delivery:** The underlying asset of the futures contract is <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">actually delivered</mark> by the seller to the buyer.
     - **Cash Settlement:** Most futures contracts these days are cash-settled. The parties settle by paying (or receiving) the <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">difference between the agreed-upon price and the market price</mark> at the contract's expiration.

4. **Exiting a Position:**
   - A trader can exit their position before the expiration date by taking an offsetting position.

### Options

- **Definition:** An option is a derivative financial instrument that gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a predetermined price within or at a specified time.

- **Types of Options:**
  1. **Call Option:** Gives the holder the right to buy the underlying asset.
  2. **Put Option:** Grants the holder the right to sell the underlying asset.

- **Styles of Options:**
  - **European Options:** Can only be exercised at the expiration date, not before.
  - **American Options:** Can be exercised any time between the purchase date and the expiration date.
  - **Other Styles:** Including Bermudan options (exercisable on specific dates) and Asian options (payoff depends on the average price of the underlying asset over a certain period).

- **Valuation:** The value of an option is derived from various factors, including the price of the underlying asset, the strike price of the option, the time until expiration, the volatility of the underlying asset, and the risk-free interest rate. Various models, like the <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Black-Scholes model</mark>, are used to estimate option prices.

- **Usage:** Options can be used for various purposes, including hedging against price movements in the underlying asset, speculating on future price movements, or capturing potential dividends.

### Risks & Considerations:

- **Leverage Risk:** Because of the margin system, futures trading is highly leveraged. A small price movement can lead to a significant profit or loss compared to the initial margin deposit.
- **Liquidity Risk:** Some futures contracts might not be very liquid, leading to larger bid-ask spreads or difficulty in closing a position.
- **Basis Risk:** This is the risk that arises from the difference between the spot price (current market price) and the futures price.

### Example with Deposit Mechanism:

Suppose a trader enters into a futures contract to buy one gold bar (about 400 oz) in six months at $2,000 per ounce. The total value of the contract is $800,000 (400 oz x $2,000). The futures exchange might set an initial margin of 5%, so the trader deposits $40,000. If gold prices rise to $2,050 per ounce the next day, the trader gains $20,000 (50 x 400), which gets added to their margin account. Conversely, if the price drops to $1,950, their account would be debited $20,000. If this brings their margin below a certain threshold, say $30,000, they will receive a margin call and must deposit additional funds.
