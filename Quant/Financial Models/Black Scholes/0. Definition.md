The Black-Scholes model is a mathematical model used to estimate the fair price or theoretical value for a European call or put option, using inputs such as the current stock price, strike price, time to expiration, risk-free interest rate, and volatility. Here are the key components of the Black-Scholes model and how to implement it in Python.

## Model Assumptions

The Black-Scholes model is based on the following assumptions:

-   The underlying asset follows a geometric Brownian motion with constant drift and volatility.
-   There are no transaction costs or taxes.
-   The risk-free interest rate is constant and known.
-   The market is efficient and there are no arbitrage opportunities.

## Black-Scholes Formula

The Black-Scholes formula for a European call option is:

$$C(S, t) = S N(d_1) - Ke^{-r(T-t)}N(d_2)$$

where:

-   $C$ is the call option price
-   $S$ is the current stock price
-   $K$ is the strike price
-   $r$ is the risk-free interest rate
-   $T-t$ is the time to expiration
-   $N(\cdot)$ is the cumulative standard normal distribution function
-   $d_1 = \frac{\ln(S/K) + (r+\frac{\sigma^2}{2})(T-t)}{\sigma\sqrt{T-t}}$
-   $d_2 = d_1 - \sigma\sqrt{T-t}$

The formula for a European put option is similar, but with some changes to the equation.

## Python Implementation:


```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import norm

def black_scholes_call(S, K, T, r, sigma):
    d1 = (np.log(S/K) + (r + 0.5 * sigma**2) * T) / (sigma * np.sqrt(T))
    d2 = d1 - sigma * np.sqrt(T)
    call_price = S * norm.cdf(d1) - K * np.exp(-r * T) * norm.cdf(d2)
    return call_price

def black_scholes_put(S, K, T, r, sigma):
    d1 = (np.log(S/K) + (r + 0.5 * sigma**2) * T) / (sigma * np.sqrt(T))
    d2 = d1 - sigma * np.sqrt(T)
    put_price = K * np.exp(-r * T) * norm.cdf(-d2) - S * norm.cdf(-d1)
    return put_price
```
