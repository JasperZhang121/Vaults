### Overview
Futures are standardized contracts obligating the buyer to purchase, and the seller to sell, a specific quantity of an asset at a predetermined price on a specified future date. Futures are used for hedging against price changes or speculating on future price movements of various assets, including commodities, currencies, and financial instruments.

### Key Characteristics
- **Standardization**: Every futures contract specifies the quantity, quality, and delivery location for the asset.
- **Leverage**: Futures contracts require a margin deposit, rather than the full value of the underlying asset, allowing for significant leverage.
- **Mark-to-Market**: Futures positions are adjusted to the market value daily, with gains and losses credited or debited to the traders' accounts.

### Types of Futures Contracts
- **Commodity Futures**: Contracts based on physical goods like oil, gold, or agricultural products.
- **Financial Futures**: Include contracts for currencies, interest rates, and stock indices.

### Trading and Settlement
- **Futures Exchanges**: Such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), provide a platform for trading.
- **Clearing Houses**: Act as intermediaries to all trades, ensuring financial integrity by guaranteeing the performance of all contracts.

### Pricing Factors
- **Spot Price**: The current market price of the asset.
- **Cost of Carry**: Includes storage costs, financing costs, and benefits lost due to holding the contract instead of the asset (like dividends).
- **Expectations of Future Price Movements**: Tradersâ€™ expectations of future prices based on supply and demand forecasts.

### Strategies
- **Hedging**: Producers and consumers of commodities use futures to hedge against price movements.
- **Speculation**: Traders aim to profit from predicting future price movements.
- **Arbitrage**: The simultaneous purchase and sale of similar futures contracts in different markets to profit from price discrepancies
