### Overview
Forwards are private agreements between two parties to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined future date and price. Unlike futures, forwards are not standardized or traded on an exchange.

### Key Features
- **Customization**: Terms of the contract can be tailored to meet the needs of both parties.
- **Settlement**: Typically settled at the end of the contract, not marked to market daily.
- **Counterparty Risk**: Risk that the other party may default on their obligations.

### Benefits and Risks
- **Hedging**: Effective for managing risk in foreign exchange, commodities, and other markets.
- **Flexibility**: Custom terms can closely align with hedging needs.
- **Credit Risk**: Higher than with exchange-traded instruments due to the lack of a clearinghouse.
