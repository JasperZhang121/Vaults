### Call and Put Options
- **Call Options**: Give the holder the right to buy the underlying asset at the strike price.
- **Put Options**: Give the holder the right to sell the underlying asset at the strike price.

### Option Styles
- **American Options**: Can be exercised at any time before expiration.
- **European Options**: Can only be exercised on the expiration date itself.
- **Asian Options**: Payoff depends on the average price of the underlying asset over a certain period.
- **Binary Options**: Have an all-or-nothing payoff based on whether the underlying asset meets the strike price at expiration.
- **Barrier Options**: Become activated or deactivated if the underlying asset reaches a certain barrier.

### Exotic Options
- Exotic options offer more complex strategies than standard American or European options. Examples include Bermuda options (a hybrid between American and European), Lookback options (payoff depends on the maximum or minimum price of the underlying asset during the contract period), and Chooser options (the holder can choose whether the option is a call or a put at a certain point during its life).

### Valuation and Pricing Models

#### Black-Scholes Model (for European Options)
- **Formula**: $C = S_0N(d_1) - Ke^{-rt}N(d_2)$ for a call option, $$P = Ke^{-rt}N(-d_2) - S_0N(-d_1)$$ for a put option.
- **Where**:
  - \(C\) is the call option price, \(P\) is the put option price.
  - \(S_0\) is the current price of the underlying asset.
  - \(K\) is the strike price.
  - \(r\) is the risk-free interest rate.
  - \(t\) is the time to expiration.
  - $N(\cdot)$ is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution.
  - $d_1 = \frac{\ln(\frac{S_0}{K}) + (r + \frac{\sigma^2}{2})t}{\sigma\sqrt{t}}$, $d_2 = d_1 - \sigma\sqrt{t}$.
  - $\sigma$ is the volatility of the underlying asset's returns.

### Binomial Model (for American and European Options)
- This model uses a discrete-time lattice framework to model the possible paths the price of the underlying asset can take until the option's expiration.
- The valuation is performed through a process known as "backward induction," starting at expiration and working backward to the present to determine the option's price.

## Greeks
The "Greeks" measure different dimensions of risk in an options portfolio:

- **Delta (\(\Delta\))**: Measures the sensitivity of the option's price to a change in the price of the underlying asset.
- **Gamma (\(\Gamma\))**: Measures the rate of change in delta for a one-unit change in the price of the underlying asset.
- **Theta (\(\Theta\))**: Measures the sensitivity of the option's price to the passage of time.
- **Vega (\(\mathcal{V}\))**: Measures sensitivity to volatility.
- **Rho (\(\rho\))**: Measures sensitivity to the interest rate.
