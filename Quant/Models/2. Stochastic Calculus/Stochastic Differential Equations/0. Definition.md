Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) are mathematical models used to describe random phenomena that evolve continuously over time. They are commonly used in finance, physics, engineering, and other fields to model complex systems that exhibit random behavior.

In finance, SDEs are often used to model the movement of asset prices. One common application is the simulation of stock prices using the Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) model, which assumes that the log-returns of an asset follow a normal distribution with constant mean and variance over time.

## Simulating a GBM Process

To simulate a GBM process, you need to discretize the continuous-time process into discrete time intervals, then simulate the process for each interval using a random number generator. One common method is the Euler-Maruyama scheme, which is a first-order approximation of the SDE solution.

Here are the general steps for simulating a GBM process using the Euler-Maruyama scheme:

1.  Define the SDE for the asset price, which is given by:
$$ dS(t) = \mu S(t)dt + \sigma S(t)dW(t) $$

where $S(t)$ is the stock price at time $t$, $\mu$ is the drift rate, $\sigma$ is the volatility, $dt$ is the time step, and $dW(t)$ is a Wiener process (Brownian motion) with mean 0 and variance $dt$.

2.  Discretize the SDE using the Euler-Maruyama scheme, which approximates the solution as:
$$ S(t+dt) = S(t) + \mu S(t)dt + \sigma S(t)\sqrt{dt}Z $$

where $Z$ is a standard normal random variable.

3.  Generate a sequence of random numbers Z using a random number generator.
    
4.  Simulate the process for each time step by iteratively applying the Euler-Maruyama scheme. Starting with the initial stock price S(0), repeat the following steps for each time step:
    
    a. Calculate the new stock price S(t+dt) using the Euler-Maruyama scheme.
    
    b. Store the new stock price in an array.
    
5.  Repeat steps 3-4 to simulate multiple sample paths.
