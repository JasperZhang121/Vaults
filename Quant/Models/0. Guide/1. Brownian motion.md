Brownian motion is a stochastic process that is often used in mathematical finance to model the random fluctuations of asset prices and interest rates. The formula for Brownian motion can be written as:
$$dW(t) = dB(t)\sqrt{dt}$$

where $dB(t)$ is the increment in a standard Brownian motion process between time $t$ and $t+dt$, and $\sqrt{dt}$ is a scaling factor.


Brownian motion is characterized by two key properties:

1.  It is continuous, meaning that it does not have any sudden jumps or discontinuities.
2.  It is stochastic, meaning that it involves randomness or uncertainty.

These properties make Brownian motion a useful tool for modeling the behavior of financial markets and other systems that are subject to randomness.

One important application of Brownian motion is in the Black-Scholes model for pricing options, which is based on the assumption that asset prices follow a log-normal Brownian motion process. This model is widely used in the financial industry to value and hedge options, and has had a significant impact on the practice of quantitative finance.
