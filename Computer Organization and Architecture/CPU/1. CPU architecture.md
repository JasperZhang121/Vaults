A CPU (Central Processing Unit) typically contains several functional units, including:

1.  Control Unit (CU) - manages the overall operation of the CPU and coordinates the activities of the other units.
    
2.  Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) - performs arithmetic and logical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and bitwise operations.
    
3.  Register File - a small amount of fast storage within the CPU that holds data temporarily while the CPU processes it.
    
4.  Instruction Decoder - interprets the machine code instructions and generates the control signals that direct the operation of the other units.
    
5.  Cache Memory - a small, fast memory system within the CPU that stores frequently-used data and instructions to reduce the number of memory accesses required.
    
6.  Data Bus - a set of electrical pathways that carries data to and from the CPU and other parts of the system.
    
7.  Address Bus - a set of electrical pathways that carries memory addresses to and from the CPU and memory.
    
8.  Clock Circuit - generates a clock signal that controls the timing of the CPU's operations.
    

These functional units work together to execute the instructions of a computer program and perform the computation required by the program. The specific implementation of these units can vary depending on the CPU architecture, but they all serve the same basic purpose of processing data and executing instructions.
