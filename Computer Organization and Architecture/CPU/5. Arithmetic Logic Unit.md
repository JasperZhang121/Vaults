Inside a computer, there is an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), which is capable of performing logical operations (e.g. AND, OR, Ex-OR, Invert etc.) in addition to the arithmetic operations (e.g. Addition, Subtraction etc.). The control unit supplies the data required by the ALU from memory, or from input devices, and directs the ALU to perform a specific operation based on the instruction fetched from the memory. ALU is the “calculator” portion of the computer.
