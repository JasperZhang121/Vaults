#### Clock Speed

- Clock speed refers to the rate at which the CPU executes instructions and is measured in Hertz (Hz).
- It determines the number of instructions the CPU can process per second.
- Higher clock speeds generally result in faster performance.

#### Instruction Set

- The instruction set refers to the set of instructions that the CPU can execute.
- It defines the operations that the CPU can perform, such as arithmetic, logical, and data transfer operations.

#### Number of Cores

- The number of cores refers to the number of independent processing units within the CPU.
- Each core can execute instructions independently, allowing for parallel processing.
- CPUs with multiple cores can perform tasks simultaneously, improving overall performance.

#### Cache Size

- Cache size refers to the amount of fast memory available on the CPU for storing frequently accessed data and instructions.
- Larger cache sizes can lead to better performance by reducing the need to access slower main memory.

#### Thermal Design Power (TDP)

- TDP represents the maximum amount of power that the CPU can consume and the maximum amount of heat it can generate.
- It is an important parameter for system builders as it helps determine the cooling requirements for the CPU.

#### Architecture

- CPU architecture refers to the underlying design and organization of the CPU.
- Different architectures have different features, instruction sets, and performance characteristics.
- Common CPU architectures include x86, ARM, and PowerPC.

#### Pipelining

- Pipelining is a technique used in CPUs to improve instruction throughput.
- It divides the execution of instructions into stages, allowing multiple instructions to be processed simultaneously.
