The Front Side Bus (FSB) is a critical component in a computer system that enables communication between the CPU and other components. It serves as a data highway, facilitating the transfer of data, instructions, and control signals between the CPU and various parts of the system.

Key Points:

- The FSB connects the CPU to other components such as memory, chipset, and input/output devices.
- It carries different types of data and signals, including memory requests, data transfers, and control signals.
- The FSB operates at a specific frequency, known as the FSB clock speed, which determines the rate of data transfer.
- It plays a crucial role in coordinating the flow of data and instructions within the computer system.
- The FSB handles functions such as interrupt handling, power management, and system configuration.
- Modern computer architectures may use alternative technologies like Direct Media Interface (DMI) or QuickPath Interconnect (QPI) instead of a traditional FSB.'
