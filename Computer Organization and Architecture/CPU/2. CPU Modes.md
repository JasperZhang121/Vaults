There are several modes in which a CPU can operate:

-   **User mode**: In this mode, the CPU has limited access to system resources, it can only execute user-level applications, and it cannot access protected areas of memory or execute privileged instructions.
    
-   **Kernel mode**: In this mode, the CPU has full access to system resources, it can execute privileged instructions, access protected areas of memory, and interact with hardware devices. This mode is typically used by the operating system's core components and device drivers.
    
-   **Real mode**: This mode is available on x86 architecture-based processors and is a legacy mode. In this mode, the CPU operates in a 16-bit environment, and has access to all system memory without paging or memory protection.
    
-   **Protected mode**: This mode is also available on x86 architecture-based processors. It is a 32-bit mode that enables memory protection and paging, and provides more efficient use of memory and improved performance.
