### Word Length
- Refers to the number of bits that can be processed in a single instruction.
- Modern computers typically have word lengths of <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">32 bits or 64 bits</mark>.
- Longer word lengths (W) allow for larger data manipulation and precision in calculations.

### Data Path Bandwidth
- Represents the maximum amount of data that can be transferred between components per unit time.
- Measured in bits per second (**bps**) or bytes per second (**Bps**).
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Data Path Bandwidth (B) = Data Transfer Rate / Time
</mark>
### Main Memory Capacity
- Refers to the amount of data that can be <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">stored and accessed directly by the CPU</mark>.
- Commonly measured in gigabytes (GB) or terabytes (TB).

#### Throughput and Response Time
- Throughput (TP) is the number of tasks completed per unit time, indicating system efficiency.  $$TP = Tasks / Time$$
- Response time (RT) is the time taken to respond to a request, affecting user experience.  $$\text{RT} = \text{End Time} - \text{Start Time}$$
#### Clock Frequency and CPU Clock Cycle
- **Clock frequency** (f) is measured in Hertz (Hz) and represents the speed at which the CPU executes instructions.
- **CPU clock cycle** (T) is the time taken to complete one clock cycle. $$T = \frac{1}{f}$$
#### CPI (Cycles Per Instruction)
- Represents the average number of clock cycles required to execute an instruction.
- $$\text{CPI} = \frac{\text{Total Clock Cycles}}{\text{Total Instructions Executed}}$$
#### CPU Execution Time
- CPU Execution Time (T_cpu) = CPI * Number of Instructions * Clock Cycle Time
- $$\text{ET} = \text{CPI} \times \text{I} \times \text{T}$$
#### MIPS (Million Instructions Per Second)
$$\text{MIPS} = \frac{\text{Instructions Executed}}{\text{Execution Time} \times 10^6}$$

#### FLOPS (Floating-Point Operations Per Second)
$$\text{FLOPS} = \frac{\text{Floating-Point Operations}}{\text{Execution Time}}$$

### Benchmark Program
- A standardized program used to evaluate and compare performance.
- Helps identify strengths and weaknesses, guiding system improvements and optimizations.
