1.  Loading the code into memory: The operating system reads the code from disk and loads it into main memory.
    
2.  Fetching the first instruction: The CPU's control unit fetches the first instruction from memory and stores it in the instruction register.
    
3.  Decoding the instruction: The instruction decoder unit interprets the machine code instruction stored in the instruction register and generates the control signals that direct the operation of the other units.
    
4.  Fetching operands: If the instruction requires operands, the CPU fetches them from memory and stores them in the register file.
    
5.  Executing the instruction: The Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) of the CPU performs the computation required by the instruction, using the values stored in the register file.
    
6.  Storing results: If the instruction produces a result, the ALU stores it in the register file or in memory, depending on the instruction and the architecture of the CPU.
    
7.  Fetching the next instruction: The CPU's control unit fetches the next instruction from memory and repeats the process from step 3, continuing until all instructions have been executed.
    
8.  Returning results: If the code produces a result that needs to be returned to the operating system or to another part of the program, the result is stored in memory or in a register and made available for use.
    

This process occurs repeatedly and in parallel for multiple instructions, allowing the CPU to execute many instructions in a short amount of time and perform the computation required by the program. The specific details of the process can vary depending on the architecture of the CPU and the specific instruction set used by the machine, but this is the general idea of how a piece of code is run from disk to CPU and returned.
