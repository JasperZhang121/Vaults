### Carry Counting System and Mutual Conversion

#### Carry Counting Method
In arithmetic operations, a carry occurs when the result of an addition or another operation exceeds the capacity of the number representation. For example, in binary addition:

```
  1011
+ 0110
-------
 10001
```

Here, a carry occurs from the second column to the third column, resulting in the final carry-out bit.

#### Conversion Between Different Base Numbers
Converting numbers between different bases involves changing the representation of a number from one base to another. For instance, converting the decimal number 42 to binary:

```
Decimal 42 = Binary 101010
```

Another example is converting hexadecimal A3 to decimal:

```
Hexadecimal A3 = Decimal 163
```

#### True Values and Machine Numbers
True values are the actual numerical values represented by numbers. In contrast, machine numbers are the numerical values represented in a computer system, which may have <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">limited precision and range due to finite representation</mark>. For example, the true value of 1/3 is 0.3333..., but in a computer system, it might be represented as 0.3333 due to limited precision.

### BCD (Binary Coded Decimal)

#### Encoded Representation of Fixed-Point Numbers
BCD is a binary encoding scheme used to represent decimal numbers. Each decimal digit is represented by a 4-bit binary code. For example:

```
Decimal 9 = BCD 1001
Decimal 5 = BCD 0101
```

So, the BCD representation of the number 95 is 10010101.

### Fixed-Point Representation

#### Original Code

- Positive Numbers: Sign bit (0) + True Value. The sign bit is 0 for positive numbers.
- Negative Numbers: 2^n + |True Value|, where n is the order of magnitude of the True Value. If it's a decimal, n = 0. In other words, for decimals, it's represented as 1 + |True Value|.

```
True value: +10000101 -10101100
Original code: 010000101 110101100
```

#### One's Complement (Reverse)

- Positive Numbers: Same as the Original Code.
- Negative Numbers: Obtain the One's Complement by flipping all bits of the Original Code for negative numbers.

```
True value: +1010111 -1110101 -101010100
Reverse code: 01010111 10001010 1010101011
```
#### Two's Complement (Complement)

- Positive Numbers: Sign bit (0) + True Value. The sign bit is 0 for positive numbers.
- Negative Numbers: 2^n + 1 + True Value (equivalent to 2^n + 1 - |True Value|), where n is the order of magnitude of the True Value. For decimals, n = 0. That is, it's represented as 2 + True Value.

```
True value: +1010111 -1110101 -101010100
Complement code: 01010111 10001011 1010101100
```
#### Offset Binary (Frameshift)

- Used only for representing integers: 2^n + True Value.

```
True value: 10100 -10100
Frameshift: 1,10100 0,01100
```

### Mutual Conversions (Relationships)

#### Original Code - One's Complement

- Positive Numbers: Same representation.
- Negative Numbers: The sign bit remains unchanged, and the value part is inverted.

#### One's Complement - Two's Complement

- Positive Numbers: Same representation.
- Negative Numbers: The sign bit remains 1, the value bits are inverted, and 1 is added to the result.

#### Two's Complement - Offset Binary

- Only the sign bits of Two's Complement and Offset Binary are opposite, while the numerical bits remain exactly the same.

### Example 1: Positive Numbers

|Type|Value|
|---|---|
|True Value|+1011|
|Original Code|01011|
|One's Complement|01011|
|Two's Complement|01011|
|Offset Binary|11011|

### Example 2: Negative Numbers

|Type|Value|
|---|---|
|True Value|-1011|
|Original Code|11011|
|One's Complement|10100|
|Two's Complement|10101|
|Offset Binary|00101|

### Integer Representation

#### Unsigned Integer Representation
Unsigned integers represent non-negative whole numbers using a fixed number of bits. For example, an 8-bit unsigned integer can represent values from 0 to 255.

#### Signed Integer Representation
Signed integers represent both positive and negative whole numbers. Techniques include sign-magnitude representation, one's complement, and two's complement. For example, using 8 bits, the number -6 can be represented as:
- Sign-magnitude: 10000110
- One's complement: 11111001
- Two's complement: 11111010
