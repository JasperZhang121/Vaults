- RAM is the main memory of a computer system.
- It is a form of volatile memory that is easily read from and written to by the microprocessor.
- RAM is called random access because any address can be accessed at any time, unlike sequential access devices such as tapes or hard drives.

### Static RAM (SRAM)

- Static RAM is a type of RAM that uses internal flip-flops to store binary information.
- The stored data remains intact as long as power is provided to the unit.
- SRAM is fast and has shorter read and write cycles compared to other types of RAM.

### Dynamic RAM (DRAM)

- Dynamic RAM stores binary data in the form of electric charges on capacitors.
- The stored value on the capacitors tends to discharge over time, so the capacitors need to be regularly refreshed.
- DRAM is less expensive and provides higher memory density but requires more frequent refreshing compared to SRAM.

## Memory Management

- The operating system plays a crucial role in managing the main memory.
- It controls the allocation of memory to processes, manages the swapping of data between main memory and secondary storage, and ensures efficient utilization of memory resources.
- The memory management unit (MMU) translates logical addresses used by the CPU into physical addresses used by the main memory.
