### Series Machines
- Refers to a type of computer architecture where instructions are executed sequentially.
- Common in early computers and some embedded systems.

### Compatible
- Describes the ability of hardware or software to work together without issues.
- Compatibility ensures interoperability and smooth operation between different components or systems.

### Software Portability
- Refers to the ease with which software can be transferred or adapted to different environments or platforms.
- Portable software requires minimal modification to run on various systems, enhancing flexibility and usability.

### Firmware
- Refers to software that is embedded into hardware devices.
- Firmware provides low-level control and functionality to the hardware, such as booting processes, device drivers, and system configurations.
- Unlike software, firmware is typically stored in non-volatile memory and is not easily changed by the user.

### Virtualization
- Refers to the process of creating a virtual (rather than actual) version of something, such as a virtual machine (VM) that runs on a physical computer.
- Virtualization allows for better resource utilization, isolation of applications, and flexibility in managing computing resources.

### Cache Memory
- Cache memory is a small, high-speed memory located closer to the CPU than main memory.
- It stores frequently accessed data and instructions, reducing the time needed to access them from slower memory devices like RAM.

### Kernel
- The kernel is the core component of an operating system that manages system resources, such as memory, CPU, and devices.
- It provides essential services for running applications and acts as a bridge between software and hardware.

### RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks)
- RAID is a data storage technology that combines multiple physical disk drives into a single logical unit for redundancy, performance improvement, or both.
- Different RAID levels (e.g., RAID 0, RAID 1, RAID 5) offer varying levels of data protection and performance benefits.

### Firewall
- A firewall is a network security device or software that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.
- Firewalls help protect against unauthorized access, malware, and other cyber threats.

### API (Application Programming Interface)
- An API is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate and interact with each other.
- APIs define how software components should interact, making it easier to develop and integrate diverse systems.

### Scalability
- Scalability refers to the ability of a system, network, or software to handle increasing workload or demand while maintaining performance and reliability.
- Scalable systems can be easily expanded or upgraded to accommodate growth without significant impact on functionality.
