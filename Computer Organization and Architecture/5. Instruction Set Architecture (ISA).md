## Definition

-   Set of instructions that a CPU can execute
-   Each instruction performs a specific operation

## Types of instructions

1.  Data transfer instructions
2.  Arithmetic instructions
3.  Logical instructions
4.  Branch instructions
5.  Jump instructions
6.  System call instructions

## Encoding

-   Instructions are encoded in machine language
-   Opcode: instruction code
-   Operand: data used by instruction

## Instruction Format

-   Instruction format determines how instructions are encoded
-   Common formats:
    -   Fixed-length
    -   Variable-length
    -   Stack-based

## Importance

-   ISA determines the types of software that can run on a CPU
-   Differences in ISA can greatly affect performance and compatibility

## Data transfer instructions

-   **MOV (Move)**: Copies the value of one register or memory location to another register or memory location.
-   **LEA (Load Effective Address)**: Calculates the address of a memory location and stores it in a register.
-   **PUSH (Push)**: Decrements the stack pointer and stores a value on the top of the stack.
-   **POP (Pop)**: Retrieves a value from the top of the stack and increments the stack pointer.

## Arithmetic instructions

-   **ADD (Addition)**: Adds two values and stores the result in a register.
-   **SUB (Subtraction)**: Subtracts one value from another value and stores the result in a register.
-   **INC (Increment)**: Adds 1 to a register or memory location.
-   **DEC (Decrement)**: Subtracts 1 from a register or memory location.

## Logical instructions

-   **AND (Logical AND)**: Performs a bitwise AND operation between two values and stores the result in a register.
-   **OR (Logical OR)**: Performs a bitwise OR operation between two values and stores the result in a register.
-   **NOT (Logical NOT)**: Performs a bitwise NOT operation on a value and stores the result in a register.
-   **XOR (Logical XOR)**: Performs a bitwise XOR operation between two values and stores the result in a register.

## Control transfer instructions

-   **JMP (Jump)**: Transfers control to another part of the program, usually an address specified as an operand.
-   **CALL (Call)**: Saves the address of the next instruction on the stack and transfers control to another part of the program.
-   **RET (Return)**: Retrieves the return address from the stack and transfers control to that address.
-   **CMP (Compare)**: Compares two values and sets flags in the processor status register to indicate the result. Used in conjunction with conditional jump instructions.

## Miscellaneous instructions

-   **NOP (No operation)**: Performs no operation, used for padding or delaying program execution.
-   **HLT (Halt)**: Halts the processor, stopping program execution.
-   **INT (Interrupt)**: Triggers a software interrupt, allowing the program to interact with the operating system or other software.
