A CPU (Central Processing Unit) typically contains several functional units, including:

1.  Control Unit (CU) - manages the overall operation of the CPU and coordinates the activities of the other units.
    
2.  Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) - performs arithmetic and logical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and bitwise operations.
    
3.  Register File - a small amount of fast storage within the CPU that holds data temporarily while the CPU processes it.
    
4.  Instruction Decoder - interprets the machine code instructions and generates the control signals that direct the operation of the other units.
    
5.  Cache Memory - a small, fast memory system within the CPU that stores frequently-used data and instructions to reduce the number of memory accesses required.
    
6.  Data Bus - a set of electrical pathways that carries data to and from the CPU and other parts of the system.
    
7.  Address Bus - a set of electrical pathways that carries memory addresses to and from the CPU and memory.
    
8.  Clock Circuit - generates a clock signal that controls the timing of the CPU's operations.
    

These functional units work together to execute the instructions of a computer program and perform the computation required by the program. The specific implementation of these units can vary depending on the CPU architecture, but they all serve the same basic purpose of processing data and executing instructions.

## CPU Modes

There are several modes in which a CPU can operate:

-   **User mode**: In this mode, the CPU has limited access to system resources, it can only execute user-level applications, and it cannot access protected areas of memory or execute privileged instructions.
    
-   **Kernel mode**: In this mode, the CPU has full access to system resources, it can execute privileged instructions, access protected areas of memory, and interact with hardware devices. This mode is typically used by the operating system's core components and device drivers.
    
-   **Real mode**: This mode is available on x86 architecture-based processors and is a legacy mode. In this mode, the CPU operates in a 16-bit environment, and has access to all system memory without paging or memory protection.
    
-   **Protected mode**: This mode is also available on x86 architecture-based processors. It is a 32-bit mode that enables memory protection and paging, and provides more efficient use of memory and improved performance.

## The operating system operates in kernel mode when performing the following tasks:

1. Interacting with hardware devices such as disk drives, network interfaces, and keyboard/mouse.

2. Allocating and managing system resources, such as memory and processing time.

3. Providing system services such as file and process management.

4. Enforcing security and access control, such as user authentication and permissions.

5. Implementing system-level APIs and libraries, such as those for process management, file I/O, and inter-process communication.

6. Handling interrupt and exception handling, such as managing hardware faults or traps.

7. Implementing system-level debugging and tracing, such as providing kernel-level logs and debugging facilities.

These tasks require a high level of control and access to system resources, so they are typically performed in kernel mode.

## The CPU switches from user mode to kernel mode in the following scenarios:

1.  System Calls: When a user-level process makes a system call, the CPU switches to kernel mode to execute the requested system service.
    
2.  Interrupts: When an interrupt request is received by the CPU, it switches to kernel mode to handle the interrupt and then return to the previous mode.
    
3.  Exceptions: When an exception occurs, such as a divide-by-zero error or a page fault, the CPU switches to kernel mode to handle the exception and then return to the previous mode.
    
4.  Scheduling: When the operating system performs context switching, it switches from one process's user mode to another process's user mode, requiring the CPU to switch to kernel mode first.
    
5.  Hardware Interactions: When the operating system interacts with hardware devices, such as reading or writing data to a disk, the CPU switches to kernel mode to execute the necessary instructions.
