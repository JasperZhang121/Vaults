CMake is cross-platform free and open-source software for build automation, testing, packaging and installation of software by using a compiler-independent method. CMake is not a build system itself; it generates another system's build files.

----

**CMakeLists.txt**

Situation 1: Simgle Cpp
- require cmake version above 3.0
- name the project as EXAMPLE
- generate example_cmake

```Cmake

cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.0)

project(EXAMPLE)

add_executable(example_cmake example.cpp)

```


Situation 2: Multiple Cpp with head files

```shell
tree . 
```

|---CMakeLists.txt
|
|---HeadFolder
|           |--- headfile.h
|--- EXAMPLE.cpp
|---SOURCE
|           |---headfile.cpp


``` CMake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.0)

project(EXAMPLE)

include-directories(HEAD_FILE_FOLDER)

add_executable(example_cmake example.cpp SOURCE/HEAD_FILE.cpp)
```

**In terminal**:
