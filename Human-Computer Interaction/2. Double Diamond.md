A design framework that is often associated with Human-Centered Design (HCD) processes, including those used in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). It is a visual representation of the divergent and convergent stages of the design process, emphasizing the importance of exploring multiple solutions before narrowing down to the most effective one.

The Double Diamond model is divided into four key phases:

1. **Discover (Divergent):**
    
    - In the first diamond, the focus is on <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">gathering insights and understanding the problem space</mark>.
    - This phase involves empathizing with users, conducting user research, and defining the scope of the design challenge.
    - The goal is to identify user needs, pain points, and opportunities.
2. **Define (Convergent):**
    
    - After exploring the problem space, the second diamond narrows the focus to define a clear and well-defined problem statement.
    - The insights from the Discover phase are synthesized to identify the key issues that need to be addressed.
    - This phase involves creating personas, user journeys, and defining design requirements.
3. **Develop (Divergent):**
    
    - The third diamond represents the phase where designers diverge to explore a wide range of potential solutions to the defined problem.
    - Creative brainstorming, ideation sessions, and prototyping are some of the activities during this phase.
    - The goal is to come up with diverse design ideas and concepts.
4. **Deliver (Convergent):**
    
    - In the final diamond, the focus shifts to converging on the most promising and feasible solution.
    - Prototypes are tested, iterated, and refined based on user feedback.
    - The outcome is a well-designed solution that addresses the initial problem statement.

The Double Diamond model emphasizes the importance of both divergent thinking (exploring multiple options) and convergent thinking (narrowing down to the best solution) in the design process. It acknowledges that creativity and innovation thrive when designers explore a wide range of ideas before converging on the most appropriate one.

The model encourages an iterative approach, meaning that after reaching the "Deliver" phase, the process can go back to any previous phase if new insights or challenges arise during testing or evaluation. This iterative nature ensures that the design solution continually improves and remains user-centered throughout the development process.
