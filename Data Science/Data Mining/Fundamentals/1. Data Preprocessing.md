Data preprocessing is an important step in data mining. It involves cleaning, transforming, and integrating data to prepare it for analysis.

-   Data cleaning: Data cleaning involves identifying and correcting errors or inconsistencies in the data, such as missing values or outliers.
    
-   Data transformation: Data transformation involves converting the data into a format that can be easily analyzed. This may involve scaling or normalizing the data, or converting categorical data into numerical form.
    
-   Data integration: Data integration involves combining data from multiple sources into a single dataset for analysis.
