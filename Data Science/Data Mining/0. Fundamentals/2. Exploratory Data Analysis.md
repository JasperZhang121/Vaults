Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of exploring and summarizing a dataset to gain insights into its underlying structure, features, and patterns. EDA is an important step in data mining as it helps to identify relationships between variables, detect outliers, and understand the distribution of the data.

The main goals of EDA are:

-   **To summarize the main features of the data**: This includes computing summary statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation, and visualizing the data using histograms, box plots, and scatter plots.
    
-   **To detect patterns and relationships in the data**: This involves exploring the relationships between variables using correlation coefficients and visualizing the data using heatmaps, cluster analysis, and principal component analysis (PCA).
    
-   **To identify potential outliers or anomalies**: This involves using techniques such as scatter plots, box plots, and kernel density estimates to identify data points that are far from the central tendency of the data.
    
-   **To check assumptions**: EDA is used to verify assumptions about the data, such as normality, linearity, and independence.
    

EDA is an iterative process that involves multiple rounds of analysis and visualization. It helps to generate hypotheses about the data and identify potential areas for further investigation.
