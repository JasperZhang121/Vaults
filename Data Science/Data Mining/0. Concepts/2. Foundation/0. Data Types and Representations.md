Data is generally structured as **objects,** with each object described by some kind of **properties**, or **attributes**, or **features**,  of some real-world or abstract entity. Some of those attributes may include **relationships** to other objects.  

-   Example: a Medical database may include information about patient objects and treatment objects with relations connecting patients to the treatments they are given
-   Example: Attributes of a patient may include name, gender and birth date. Attributes of a treatment may include treatment name, responsible doctor,  and date.

The objects may alternatively be called _samples, examples, instances, data points, observations, rows, tuples, records,_ or _vectors._ The attributes may be called _fields, variables, dimensions, properties,_ or _features._ This will depend on the data model or data mining discipline you are working with, and you need to be comfortable with all of those names.
