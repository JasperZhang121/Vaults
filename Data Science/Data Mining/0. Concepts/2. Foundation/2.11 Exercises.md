> The function average() is

```
Algebraic because it is not distributive itself (i.e you cannot compute it from averages of data subsets) but it can be computed from the  2 distributive functions sum() and count(). Both of those can be computed by summing and (respectively) counting the sums and (respectively) counts of subsets of data.
