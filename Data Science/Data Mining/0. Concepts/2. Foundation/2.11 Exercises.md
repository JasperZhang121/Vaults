### 1.
>An attribute _favourite sport_ with values drawn from the set _{soccer, rugby, hockey, netball, tennis, other}_ is  likely to be of what attribute type?

```
Nominal attributes are categories, states, or “names of things”, with no expected ordering amongst the states.   Also discrete because it has only a finite or countably infinite set of values.

Nominal
Discrete

### 2.
>_Year_, (e.g. 1960, 1984, 2000, 2005),  according to the Gregorian calendar (i.e. the calendar we use every day), is a ratio-scaled attribute.

```
It  does not have a "true zero" and you cannot sensibly talk about the ratio like  2005/1984.

False
```


### 3.
> The function average() is

```
Algebraic because it is not distributive itself (i.e you cannot compute it from averages of data subsets) but it can be computed from the  2 distributive functions sum() and count(). Both of those can be computed by summing and (respectively) counting the sums and (respectively) counts of subsets of data. 

Algebraic

### 4.
> The approximate equality mean - mode ≈ 3 x (mean - median)

```
is a  rule-of thumb that works well for data with a single peak in the distribution and a spread that is not too asymmetric.
```


### 5.
> The inter-quartile range

```
is indicated by the length of the box on a box-plot diagram

is the difference between the third quartile and the first quartile

is useful to indicate the spread of the data
```


### 6.
> Standard deviation is the square root of _variance._

```
True
```


### 7.
> By Chebyshev's inequality,we know that  
> 	_At least (1 - 1/k2) x 100% of the observations are no more than k standard deviations from the mean._
> If  we set k to 2 , then this is a convenient explanation of how standard deviation measures dispersion.
> How would you explain standard deviation to someone who does not understand it using k=2?

```
at least 3/4 of the values are no more than 2 standard deviations from the mean
```


### 8.

In a dissimilarity matrix, the x-axis and y-axis represent the<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;"> objects or entities in the data set, not the attributes</mark>.

A dissimilarity matrix is a square matrix that shows the dissimilarity or distance between <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">pairs of objects</mark> in a data set. The diagonal of the matrix is usually zero, since the distance between an object and itself is zero. The upper and lower triangles of the matrix are symmetric, since the distance between object A and object B is the same as the distance between object B and object A.


### 9.
> The objects X and Y are described by nominal attributes. Using the simple matching technique, give the _dissimilarity_ of X and Y to 2 decimal places.
> X = (red, medium, medium, maths, north, green).
> Y = (red, large, medium, literature, west, red).

```
Nonmatches = 4. Attributes = 6

dis(X,Y) = 4/6 = 0.67

The correct answer is: 0.67
```


### 10.
> The _Jaccard co-efficient_ is also called **asymmetric binary similarity.**
> Calculate the Jaccard co-efficient for the following objects X and Y, where all  5 attributes are asymmetric and  "+" (i.e. _positive_)  values are considered significant.
> X = (+, -, - , -, +)
> Y = (+, +, -, -, -)

```
dis(X,Y) =  2/ (1+1+1) = 2/3

sim (X,Y) = 1-dis(X,Y) = 1/3

The correct answer is: 0.33
```
