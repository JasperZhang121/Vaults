A nominal attribute may have two or more states as values (if only two, then it is binary).

Let the number of states for a nominal attribute be $M$.

For convenience, we denote the states by integers $1,2,...,M$  but note that no ordering is implied here.

Method 1: Simple matching
Let $m$ be the number of matches  i.e. the number of attributes for which object $i$ and $j$ have the same value.
Let $p$ be the number of variables (i.e attributes for each object).
Then, define

$d(i,j) = \frac{p-m}{p}$

Similarity may then be defined as

$sim(i,j) = 1-d(i,j) = \frac{m}{p}$

Method 2: Map nominals to  a large number of binary attributes

Also called one-hot encoding.
Create a new binary attribute for each of the $M$ nominal values of the attribute.
e.g. for attribute Colour = {red, blue, green}, introduce  binary attributes Red, Blue and Green  and map an object with Colour = red to the corresponding object with attribute Red = 1, attribute Blue = 0 and attribute Green = 0.
Then use any method for the proximity of binary attributes.
