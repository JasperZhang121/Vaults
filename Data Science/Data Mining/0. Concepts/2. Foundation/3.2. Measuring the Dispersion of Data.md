# Range, Quartile, Variance, Standard Deviation, and Interquartile Range

**Range** is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset:

$$\text{Range} = \text{max}(x) - \text{min}(x)$$


**Quartiles** divide a dataset into four equal parts. The first quartile (Q1) is the 25th percentile, the second quartile (Q2) is the median, and the third quartile (Q3) is the 75th percentile.

**Interquartile Range (IQR)** is the difference between the third quartile and the first quartile:

$$\text{IQR} = Q3 - Q1$$

**Variance** measures how much the data deviate from the mean:

$$\text{Var}(X) = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (X_i - \mu)^2$$

where $\mu$ is the mean of the data.

**Standard Deviation** is the square root of the variance and measures the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values:

$$\text{SD}(X) = \sqrt{\text{Var}(X)}$$

-   Used very commonly to indicate data dispersion
-   A low standard deviation indicates that values tend to be close to the mean
-   Is cheap to compute
-   Measures deviation around the mean so should only be used when the mean is also used for centrality
-   σ = 0 only when all values are the same
-   An observation is unlikely to be more than several standard deviations from the mean.

-   Formally (**Chebyshev's inequality**),

**At least _(1 - 1/k2) x 100%_ of the observations are no more than _k_ standard deviations from the mean.**

`In the formula above, the so-called "n-1" method is used, due to the "n-1"  term in the denominator. You will often see standard deviation or variance alternatively written with "n", the size of the data, instead of  "n-1". Strictly, the "n-1" method is properly used for observational data that is understood to be a _sample_  (say, collected by a survey) selected from the complete population, and the standard deviation computed this way is an _estimation_ of the real standard deviation of the complete population, and this estimation minimises the expected error wrt the real standard deviation.  On the other hand, the  "n"  method computes exactly the standard deviation of the observations at hand which are then assumed to be the complete _population_ real data (say, collected by a population census). We use  the "n-1" form here under the assumption that we are interested in estimating the spread of the intended population, not just the sample to hand.  Of course, for very large data sets to which data mining is normally applied, the difference is too small to be a matter of concern.`

#### Five-number Summary and Boxplots

![[Five-number summary.png]]

-   **Five-number summary,** In order: **min, Q1, median=Q2, Q3, max**
-   Convenient summary of data dispersion
-   Illustrated in a **boxplot.**
-   Boxplots can be used to visually compare sets of compatible data.
-   Ends of the **box** are the quartiles; median is marked by a line; **whiskers** extend to min and max.

-   **Outlier**: usually, a value below  Q1 − 1.5 IQR or above Q3 + 1.5 IQR
    -   If there are outliers, then the whiskers commonly extend to 1.5 x IQR  (instead of min, max) and outliers are plotted individually.
    -   The "tailedness" or frequency of outliers compared to a central peak of the distribution in each direction is easily seen by the length of the whiskers and occurrence of individual outliers. A formal measure of tailedness called _kurtosis_ can be calculated instead.
