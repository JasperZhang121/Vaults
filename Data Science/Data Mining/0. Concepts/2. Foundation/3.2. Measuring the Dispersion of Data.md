# Range, Quartile, Variance, Standard Deviation, and Interquartile Range

**Range** is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset:

$$\text{Range} = \text{max}(x) - \text{min}(x)$$

**Quartiles** divide a dataset into four equal parts. The first quartile (Q1) is the 25th percentile, the second quartile (Q2) is the median, and the third quartile (Q3) is the 75th percentile.

**Variance** measures how much the data deviate from the mean:

$$\text{Var}(X) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (X_i - \mu)^2$$

where $\mu$ is the mean of the data.

**Standard Deviation** is the square root of the variance and measures the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values:

$$\text{SD}(X) = \sqrt{\text{Var}(X)}$$

**Interquartile Range (IQR)** is the difference between the third quartile and the first quartile:

$$\text{IQR} = Q3 - Q1$$
