## Similarity and Dissimilarity Measures

We need algorithmic ways to assess how alike or unlike objects are to others. For example, are some set of taxpayers similar in their characteristics of age, employment status and income?

### Similarity

- Numerical measure of how alike two data objects are
- Value is higher when objects are more alike
- Often falls in the range [0,1]

### Dissimilarity (e.g., distance)

- Numerical measure of how different two data objects are
- Lower when objects are more alike
- Minimum dissimilarity is often 0
- Upper limit varies
- Proximity refers to a similarity or dissimilarity

### Dissimilarity Matrix

- Common data structure used to represent dissimilarity amongst objects
- Used e.g. in main-memory based algorithms for clustering and nearest neighbour
- For n data points, an n x n matrix data structure that shows dissimilarity or distance d(i,j) for all pairs of n objects i, and j
- d(i,j) is close to 0 when objects i, and j are near to each other, i.e. the distance is small
- It is defined that d(i,j) = d(j,i) and d(i,i) = 0
- Therefore, the matrix is symmetric or triangular with zeros along the diagonal and duplicates (often not represented at all) in the upper right triangle
- Single mode or one-mode matrix because rows and columns represent the same things (i.e. objects)

### Similarity from Dissimilarity

- Similarity, sim(i,j) is often expressed as a function of dissimilarity, e.g. when d(i,j) is normalised to [0,1] we may have
  - sim(i,j) = 1 - d(i,j)

So far we have described proximity amongst pairs of objects, but each of those objects is comprised of values for attributes that may be of heterogeneous types. In the following, we show how distances may be calculated for each attribute type, and then how to combine attribute distances of mixed types to give an overall object distance.
