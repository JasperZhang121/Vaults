Normalization of numeric data is a process in which the numeric data is rescaled to fit within a specific range, typically between 0 and 1. This is done to eliminate the effect of differences in the scale of variables in the dataset, which can lead to inaccurate and biased results in data analysis.

Normalization is performed by subtracting the minimum value from each observation and then dividing it by the range of values. The range is calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the dataset.

For example, if we have a dataset of exam scores ranging from 50 to 100, we can normalize the scores as follows:

1.  Find the range: range = maximum score - minimum score = 100 - 50 = 50
    
2.  Subtract the minimum value from each score: new score = original score - minimum score
    
3.  Divide each new score by the range: normalized score = new score / range
    

After normalization, all scores will fall within the range of 0 and 1. This makes it easier to compare the scores across different variables or datasets.

There are different methods of normalization, such as min-max scaling, z-score normalization, and decimal scaling. The choice of method depends on the specific requirements of the data analysis and the characteristics of the dataset.
