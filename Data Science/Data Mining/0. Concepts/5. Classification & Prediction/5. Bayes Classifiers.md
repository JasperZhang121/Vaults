Bayesian classifiers are a family of probabilistic classifiers based on Bayes' theorem, which assumes that the probability of a particular class given an observation or input is proportional to the probability of that observation given the class. These classifiers are widely used in various fields, including natural language processing, machine learning, and computer vision.

The Bayes theorem states that:

$$P(c|x) = \frac{P(x|c) \cdot P(c)}{P(x)}$$

where:
- $P(c|x)$ is the probability of class $c$ given the observation $x$, $P(x|c)$ is the probability of observation $x$ given class $c$
- $P(c)$ is the prior probability of class $c$
- $P(x)$ is the probability of observation $x$.

To classify an observation or input x, the Bayesian classifier calculates the probability of each class given the observation x, and then selects the class with the highest probability as the predicted class.

Bayesian classifiers can be trained using a set of labeled training data, and can be used to classify new and unseen data. They are relatively simple and efficient, and can be used in a variety of classification tasks. However, they may not be suitable for complex classification problems with a large number of features or classes.

The Bayesian classifier is an incremental method, which means that it can adapt over time to gradual or incremental changes in labelled training data.
It is a "black box" method, which means that it is not easily interpretable by humans, although its relationship to its training data is straightforward to understand.

### Limitation

The Bayesian classifier has a limitation in that it <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">requires sufficient observations</mark> in the training data to obtain reliable posterior probabilities. If an observation in the testing data has a combination of attribute values that have not been seen in the training data, the classifier will assign a zero probability to it. This tendency toward zero probability increases as more attributes are incorporated into the model, as there needs to be at least one observation for every possible combination of attributes and target classes. The problem can be mitigated somewhat with naive Bayes that assumes class conditional independence, but the Laplacian correction is still needed when there is an attribute value that has not been seen in some class in the training data.
