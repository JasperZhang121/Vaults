Bayesian classifiers are a family of probabilistic classifiers based on Bayes' theorem, which assumes that the probability of a particular class given an observation or input is proportional to the probability of that observation given the class. These classifiers are widely used in various fields, including natural language processing, machine learning, and computer vision.

The Bayes theorem states that:

$$P(c|x) = \frac{P(x|c) \cdot P(c)}{P(x)}$$

where:
- $P(c|x)$ is the probability of class $c$ given the observation $x$, $P(x|c)$ is the probability of observation $x$ given class $c$
- $P(c)$ is the prior probability of class $c$
- $P(x)$ is the probability of observation $x$.

To classify an observation or input x, the Bayesian classifier calculates the probability of each class given the observation x, and then selects the class with the highest probability as the predicted class.

Bayesian classifiers can be trained using a set of labeled training data, and can be used to classify new and unseen data. They are relatively simple and efficient, and can be used in a variety of classification tasks. However, they may not be suitable for complex classification problems with a large number of features or classes.

The Bayesian classifier is an incremental method, which means that it can adapt over time to gradual or incremental changes in labelled training data.
It is a "black box" method, which means that it is not easily interpretable by humans, although its relationship to its training data is straightforward to understand.
