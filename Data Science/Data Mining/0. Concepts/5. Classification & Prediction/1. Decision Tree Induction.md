Decision tree induction is a popular machine learning method used for classification and regression problems. The process of decision tree induction involves creating a tree-like model that classifies data by <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">splitting it based on a set of attributes</mark>. At each level of the tree, the algorithm selects the attribute that best splits the data into classes, based on a criterion such as information gain or Gini impurity. This process is repeated recursively for each subset of data until a stopping criterion is met. The resulting tree can be used to classify new, unseen instances by following the path from the root to a leaf node, which indicates the class assignment.
