Handle missing attribute values
- Assign the most common value of the attribute
- Assign probability to each of the possible values

Attribute construction
- Create new attributes based on existing ones that are sparsely represented
- This reduces fragmentation, repetition, and replication

Continuous target variable
- In this case the tree is called a _regression tree_, the leaf node classes are represented by their mean values, and  the tree performs prediction (using that mean value) rather than classification.

Probabilistic classifier
- Instead of majority voting to assign a class label to a leaf node, the _proportion_ of training data objects of each class in the leaf node can be interpreted to as the _probability_ of the class, and this probability can be assigned to the classification  for unknown objects falling in that node at use-time.
