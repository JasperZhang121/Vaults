**IF-THEN rules for classification**

Rules are a good way of representing information or bits of knowledge. A rule-based classifier uses a set of IF-THEN rules for classification.

-   "IF" part
    -   Rule antecedent / precondition
    -   Condition consists of one or more attribute tests that are logically ANDed
-   "Then" part
	-   Rule consequent
	-   Contains a class prediction

**Rule Evaluation**

How to measure the quality of a single rule **R**? Use both _coverage_ and _accuracy._ The key thing to note is that the accuracy of a rule is in proportion to its coverage, not to the size of the dataset as a whole. 

-   _n_covers_ = number of tuples covered by **R,** i.e. that satisfy the antecedent of **R**
-   _n_correct_ = number of tuples correctly classified by **R** i.e that satisfy both the antecedent and the consequent
-   _D =_ training data set
-   **_coverage_**(**R**) = _n_covers_ /|_D_|
    -   the proportion of tuples that are covered by the rule 
-   **_accuracy_**(**R**) = _n_correct_ / _n_covers_

-   the proportion of covered tuples that are correctly labelled
-   in knowledge graph learning, is usually called _standard confidence_.  
    

Evaluation measures other than accuracy can be similarly adapted to using cover just as for accuracy here.
