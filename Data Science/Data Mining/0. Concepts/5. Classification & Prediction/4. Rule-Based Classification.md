**IF-THEN rules for classification**

Rules are a good way of representing information or bits of knowledge. A rule-based classifier uses a set of IF-THEN rules for classification.

-   "IF" part
    -   Rule antecedent / precondition
    -   Condition consists of one or more attribute tests that are logically ANDed
-   "Then" part
	-   Rule consequent
	-   Contains a class prediction

**Rule Evaluation**

How to measure the quality of a single rule **R**? Use both _coverage_ and _accuracy._ The key thing to note is that the accuracy of a rule is in proportion to its coverage, not to the size of the dataset as a whole. 

-   _n_covers_ = number of tuples covered by **R,** i.e. that satisfy the antecedent of **R**
-   _n_correct_ = number of tuples correctly classified by **R** i.e that satisfy both the antecedent and the consequent
-   _D =_ training data set
-   **_coverage_**(**R**) = _n_covers_ /|_D_|
    -   the proportion of tuples that are covered by the rule 
-   **_accuracy_**(**R**) = _n_correct_ / _n_covers_

-   the proportion of covered tuples that are correctly labelled
-   in knowledge graph learning, is usually called _standard confidence_.  


**Conflict Resolution**

If more than one rule is triggered, need conflict resolution

-   Size ordering: assign the highest priority to the triggering rules that has the “toughest” requirement
	-   i.e., with the most attribute tests
-   Rule ordering: prioritise the rules beforehand by class-based or rule-based
	-   Class-based ordering: prioritise classes beforehand. If a tuple is classified into multiple classes, choose a class by the class order.
	-   Rule-based ordering: the rules are organised into one long priority list, according to some measure of rule quality

**Default Rule**

A default rule can be applied if there is no rule satisfied by a tuple.
