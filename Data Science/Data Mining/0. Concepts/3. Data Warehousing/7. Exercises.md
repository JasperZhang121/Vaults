>In comparison with a traditional OLTP database, an OLAP data base is

- used for decision support
- historical rather than current and up-to-date
- needs to support complex queries

>OLAP servers are typically categorised according to one of three architectures with various cost/benefit tradeoffs.  Name the three architectures (in the uppercase acronym form) and state one benefit of each.

- ROLAP - uses familiar, scalable, relational technology
- MOLAP - efficient access to summarised data and efficient storage  of sparse data
- HOLAP - scalability of ROLAP and fast computation of MOLAP

more details
```
1.  MOLAP (Multidimensional OLAP): It stores data in a multidimensional cube format and provides fast query response times. The benefit of MOLAP is that it supports complex calculations and aggregations, which can be processed very quickly due to its storage format.
    
2.  ROLAP (Relational OLAP): It stores data in a traditional relational database management system (RDBMS) and provides good scalability and flexibility. The benefit of ROLAP is that it can handle large amounts of data, and can integrate with existing data warehouses and business intelligence systems.
    
3.  HOLAP (Hybrid OLAP): It is a combination of MOLAP and ROLAP and provides the benefits of both approaches. HOLAP allows users to store summary data in a multidimensional cube format, while the detailed data is stored in a relational database. The benefit of HOLAP is that it can handle both detailed and summary data efficiently, while providing flexibility and scalability

>An OLAP **roll-up** operation is likely to be used to:

- To look at more general, i.e., more summarised data


> A _slice_ differs from a _dice_ by:

- Anything that can be done with a slice can also be done with a dice.
- A dice allows an interval of a dimension to be selected, for example to to ignore extremities, but a slice requires only a single value for a dimension to be selected.
- A slice can select over a single dimension only, but a dice can select over multiple dimensions.
- A slice operation moves to a sub-cuboid that is a plane (ie, a cuboid with the dimension reduced by one) of the current cuboid without any change to the  measure values that remain.

> A **pivot** operation does not affect the data available in the cuboid under investigation.

```
True.
A pivot operation is a process in OLAP where the dimensions of a cube are rotated, allowing the user to view the data from a different perspective. This operation does not change the data available in the cube, but instead changes the way it is viewed. For example, if a user is viewing sales data by product and region, they can pivot the cube to view the same data by region and product. This does not affect the underlying data, only the way it is presented to the user.

> How many cuboids are generated from a base data cuboid with 11 dimensions, including the base and apex cuboids?

```
For a base data cuboid with 11 dimensions, there will be 2^11 cuboids, including the base and apex cuboids.

Therefore, the total number of cuboids generated will be 2^11 = 2048.

> Assuming the  10-D base cuboid as above, How many non-empty aggregate **cells** will be generated at the level **two** above the base in the lattice, i.e. for the **10x9/2=45  8-D** cuboids?


At this level each cuboid aggregates 2 dimensions.

In most of the 45 cuboids all 3 base cells will generate a cell : i.e 45 x 3 cells = 135

Now look at the  3 cuboids that aggregate 2 out of the first three dimensions  i.e. (*,*, 3,4,5..), (1,*,*, 4,5... ), (*,2,*,4,5,...)

Here there will only be 2 cells (not 3) in each because e.g. in the first of  these A and B collapse into 1 cell, so take off 1 x 3 = 3

So, get 45 x 3 - 3 = 132 non-empty aggregate cells.

```
When we aggregate these cells over two dimensions, there will be some cells that collapse into other cells. The number of cells that collapse would be the same as the number of pairs of dimensions that are aggregated. In this case, we are aggregating over 2 dimensions for each cuboid.

{A,B,*}  Aggregate over A,B. 
{A,*,C}  Aggregate over A,C. 
{B,*,C}  Aggregate over B,C. 

For Cuboid 1, we have the following three cells:
-   Cell 1: (a1, b2, *, *)
-   Cell 2: (a4, b5, *, *)
-   Cell 3: (a7, b8, *, *)

When we aggregate these cells over the first two dimensions (A and B), we get the following two cells:

-   Cell A: (a1, b2, *, *)
-   Cell B: (a4, b5, *, *)
-   Note that Cell 3 is not included because it collapses into Cell B.
