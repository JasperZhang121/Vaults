- needs to support complex queries

### 2.
>OLAP servers are typically categorised according to one of three architectures with various cost/benefit tradeoffs.  Name the three architectures (in the uppercase acronym form) and state one benefit of each.

- ROLAP - uses familiar, scalable, relational technology
- MOLAP - efficient access to summarised data and efficient storage  of sparse data
- HOLAP - scalability of ROLAP and fast computation of MOLAP

more details
```
1.  MOLAP (Multidimensional OLAP): It stores data in a multidimensional cube format and provides fast query response times. The benefit of MOLAP is that it supports complex calculations and aggregations, which can be processed very quickly due to its storage format.
    
2.  ROLAP (Relational OLAP): It stores data in a traditional relational database management system (RDBMS) and provides good scalability and flexibility. The benefit of ROLAP is that it can handle large amounts of data, and can integrate with existing data warehouses and business intelligence systems.
    
3.  HOLAP (Hybrid OLAP): It is a combination of MOLAP and ROLAP and provides the benefits of both approaches. HOLAP allows users to store summary data in a multidimensional cube format, while the detailed data is stored in a relational database. The benefit of HOLAP is that it can handle both detailed and summary data efficiently, while providing flexibility and scalability

### 3.
>An OLAP **roll-up** operation is likely to be used to:

- To look at more general, i.e., more summarised data

### 4.
> A _slice_ differs from a _dice_ by:

- Anything that can be done with a slice can also be done with a dice.
- A dice allows an interval of a dimension to be selected, for example to to ignore extremities, but a slice requires only a single value for a dimension to be selected.
- A slice can select over a single dimension only, but a dice can select over multiple dimensions.
- A slice operation moves to a sub-cuboid that is a plane (ie, a cuboid with the dimension reduced by one) of the current cuboid without any change to the  measure values that remain.

### 5.
> A **pivot** operation does not affect the data available in the cuboid under investigation.

```
True.
A pivot operation is a process in OLAP where the dimensions of a cube are rotated, allowing the user to view the data from a different perspective. This operation does not change the data available in the cube, but instead changes the way it is viewed. For example, if a user is viewing sales data by product and region, they can pivot the cube to view the same data by region and product. This does not affect the underlying data, only the way it is presented to the user.
```

### 6.
> How many cuboids are generated from a base data cuboid with 11 dimensions, including the base and apex cuboids?

```
For a base data cuboid with 11 dimensions, there will be 2^11 cuboids, including the base and apex cuboids.

Therefore, the total number of cuboids generated will be 2^11 = 2048.

### 8.
> Assuming the  10-D base cuboid as above, How many non-empty aggregate **cells** will be generated at the level **two** above the base in the lattice, i.e. for the **10x9/2=45  8-D** cuboids?


Step-by-step explanation:

1.  In the 45 cuboids that aggregate 2 dimensions, each of the 3 base cells generates a new cell. So, there are 45 x 3 = 135 cells.
    
2.  Among these 45 cuboids, there are 3 cuboids that aggregate 2 out of the first 3 dimensions. These cuboids are:
    
-   (* , * , 3, 4, 5, ..., 10)
-   (1, * , * , 4, 5, ..., 10)
-   (* , 2, * , 4, 5, ..., 10)

3.  In each of these 3 cuboids, only 2 cells are generated because aggregating over dimensions A and B collapses the cell (A, *, B, ...) into one cell. So, for these 3 cuboids, we subtract 3 (one cell from each base cell) from the total count of cells generated in step 1. This gives us 135 - 3 = 132 cells.
    
4.  Alternatively, we can count the number of cells generated by each cuboid and sum them up. For the 3 cuboids that aggregate 2 out of the first 3 dimensions, there are 2 cells each. For the remaining 42 cuboids, there are 3 cells each. So, the total number of cells is: 2 x 3 (for the first 3 cuboids) + 42 x 3 (for the remaining cuboids) = 6 + 126 = 132 cells.
    

Therefore, there are 132 non-empty aggregate cells in total.

```
When we aggregate these cells over two dimensions, there will be some cells that collapse into other cells. The number of cells that collapse would be the same as the number of pairs of dimensions that are aggregated. In this case, we are aggregating over 2 dimensions for each cuboid.

{A,B,*}  Aggregate over A,B. 
{A,*,C}  Aggregate over A,C. 
{B,*,C}  Aggregate over B,C. 
```

### 9.
>Assuming the 10-D base cuboid as above, we use the $*$ notation to indicate a cell with an aggregated dimension, for example, $(x_{1},_,x_{2})$ is a 2-D cell where the second dimension from the base is aggregated.
>A cell, $c$, is a closed cell if there exists no cell, $d$, such that $d$ is a specialization of cell $c$ (i.e., $d$ is obtained by replacing a $*$ in $c$ by a non-$*$ value) and $d$ has the same measure value as $c$. A closed cube is a data cube consisting of only closed cells. How many closed cells are in the full cube corresponding to the 10-D base cuboid above?

There are seven cells, as follows (here we assume the measure is count() where we show it)  
(1) (a1, d2, d3, d4, . . . , d9, d10) : 1,  
(2) (d1, b2, d3, d4, . . . , d9, d10) : 1,  
(3) (d1, d2, c3, d4, . . . , d9, d10) : 1,  
(4) (∗, ∗, d3, d4, . . . , d9, d10) : 2,  
(5) (∗, d2, ∗, d4, . . . , d9, d10) : 2,  
(6) (d1, ∗, ∗, d4, . . . , d9, d10) : 2, and  
(7) (∗, ∗, ∗, d4, . . . , d9, d10) : 3.

```
1.  (a1, d2, d3, d4, d5, d6, d7, d8, d9, d10) : 1 This is a 10-D cell with all dimensions specified, so it is trivially closed.
    
2.  (d1, b2, d3, d4, d5, d6, d7, d8, d9, d10) : 1 Similar to the first cell, this is a 10-D cell with all dimensions specified, so it is also trivially closed.
    
3.  (d1, d2, c3, d4, d5, d6, d7, d8, d9, d10) : 1 This is another 10-D cell with all dimensions specified, so it is also trivially closed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
tips:
When we aggregate one dimension, we are essentially collapsing the cells along that dimension, resulting in fewer cells but no new cells. However, when we aggregate two dimensions, we are combining cells from those dimensions and potentially creating new cells with different combinations of values from the two dimensions.
Example:
-   (A1, B1, C1): 10
-   (A1, B1, C2): 5
-   (A2, B1, C1): 8
-   (A2, B2, C1): 12

To move up a level in the lattice to the 2-D cuboids, we need to aggregate over one dimension. Let's consider the cuboids that aggregate over the first two dimensions (A and B):

-   (A1, B1, *, *): 15
-   (A2, B1, *, *): 8
-   (A2, B2, *, *): 12
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.  (_, _, d3, d4, d5, d6, d7, d8, d9, d10) : 2 This is a 8-D cell where the first two dimensions are aggregated. There are only two cells with this pattern: one with non-_ values in dimensions d3 and d4 (which has measure 1) and one with non-_ values in dimensions d5 and d6 (which also has measure 1). Since there are no other cells that can specialize this cell, it is closed.
    
5.  (_, d2, _, d4, d5, d6, d7, d8, d9, d10) : 2 This is another 8-D cell where the first and third dimensions are aggregated. There are two cells with this pattern: one with non-_ values in dimensions d4 and d5 (which has measure 1) and one with non-_ values in dimensions d6 and d7 (which also has measure 1). Since there are no other cells that can specialize this cell, it is also closed.
    
6.  (d1, _, _, d4, d5, d6, d7, d8, d9, d10) : 2 This is another 8-D cell where the second and third dimensions are aggregated. There are two cells with this pattern: one with non-_ values in dimensions d4 and d5 (which has measure 1) and one with non-_ values in dimensions d6 and d7 (which also has measure 1). Since there are no other cells that can specialize this cell, it is also closed.
    
7.  (*, *, _, d4, d5, d6, d7, d8, d9, d10) : 3 This is a 7-D cell where the first three dimensions are aggregated. There is only one cell with this pattern: one with non-_ values in dimensions d4, d5, and d6 (which has measure 1). Since there are no other cells that can specialize this cell, it is also closed.

```

### Definiton of Closed cells:

A closed cell is a cell in a data cube that has no specializations with the same measure value (count in this table). In other words, a closed cell is a cell that cannot be further divided into smaller cells with the same measure value. A data cube consisting only of closed cells is called a closed cube. Closed cubes are useful in data analysis as they provide a concise and complete representation of the underlying data, without any redundancy or unnecessary details.

Consider the following data cube:
| A | B | C | Count |
|---|---|---|-------|
| a | b | c |  10   |
| a | b | d |  5    |
| a | e | f |  15   |
| g | h | i |  20   |
| g | j | k |  30   |

Let's say we are interested in the cell (a, * , c), which represents all values of B that have the value a in dimension A and the value c in dimension C. We can see that this cell has a measure of 10, which is unique in the cube. There are no other cells in the cube that specialize this cell and have the same measure. Therefore, this cell is closed.

In general, a closed cell is a cell that has no specializations with the same measure value.

B. The aggregation level of the cube may be lower than the query, but not higher.
