**Rollup** (also called _drill-up_) <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">summarises data in one of two ways</mark>.

**1. By <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">dimension reduction</mark>**

Move from one cuboid to another <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">higher up the lattice towards the apex</mark>, where some dimension of the cube is removed and the remaining dimensions are represented by measures that are now aggregated over the missing dimension.

**2 . By <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">climbing up the concept hierarchy</mark>**

Move from one cuboid to another by stepping up a level in a concept hierarchy on one dimension. This  does not remove a dimension from the cube but <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">aggregates the measures for that dimension into bigger chunks</mark>, and so reduces the number of data points along that dimension.

Example:

Consider the cube of _sales_ with dimensions _item x time x location_  and  the concept hierarchy  along the location dimension of (_offices < cities < countries < regions).  
_

Starting from the cuboid _types x quarters x cities,_  a rollup operation:

_**roll-up** on location  from cities to countries_

would move to the cubiod t_ypes x quarters x countries_. Now, instead of being grouped by cities, the data is grouped by countries.  

Another subsequent rollup  along the same  location dimension would move to the cuboid  t_ypes x quarters x regions._

**<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Drill-down</mark>**  (also called **roll down**) is the <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">reverse of rollup</mark>, navigating from less detailed data to more detailed data. As for rollup, there are two ways to do this.

#### Slice and Dice

**1. Slice**

Slice <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">cuts off one dimension of the cube</mark>, not by aggregating but by selecting only one fixed value along one dimension.  

It corresponds to a  relational algebra _select_  (to choose which fixed value from which dimension) then  _project_  (on the remaining dimensions).  

Example  

Consider the cube of _sales_ with dimensions _item x time x location._ 

Starting from the cuboid _types x quarters x cities,_  a slice operation:

_**slice** for time = "Q1"  
_

would move to the cubiod t_ypes x_ _cities_ and every value represented holds only for the quarter Q1.  

Another subsequent slice, say for _item = "computer"_  would  result in a cuboid  for  _cities_ alon_e,_ with all data for each city being values only for computers in Q1.


**2. Dice**

**Dice** <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">cuts out  a sub-cube</mark>, not by aggregating but by selecting multiple fixed values for each of multiple dimensions. When only one dimension is selected, a _dice_ is a _slice_.  

It corresponds to some relational algebra _selects_  to choose which fixed values from which dimensions.  

Example  

Consider the cube of _sales_ with dimensions _item x time x location._ 

Starting from the cuboid _types x quarters x cities,_  a dice  operation:

_**dice** for (location = "Toronto" or "Vancouver" ) and (time = "Q1" or "Q2" ) and (item = "home entertainment" or "computer")_

would move to the cubiod t_ypes x quarters x_ _cities_  but only data for those selected dimension values would  be represented in the cuboid. That is, the only data  in the cuboid is for computers and home entertainment products, in Q1 and Q2, from Toronto and Vancouver.  

Another subsequent  dice, say for _item = "computer"_  would  result in a  3-D cuboid without any home entertainment products.

#### Pivot and Other Operations

**Pivot** (also called **rotate**) is a visualisation operator and does not change the data. It changes the data axes in view to an alternative presentation, such as by geometrically rotating a 3D cube or by presenting a 3D cube as a series of 2D planes.

Starting from the  2-D  presentation below of sales with dimensions _types  x cities,_  a _pivot_ operation would  rotate the axes to  show  _cities x types_ and the values would remain unchanged.

**Other OLAP Operations**

OLAP servers typically offer many other operations. Some of the more common are

-   Drill-across: involving (across) more than one fact table
-   Drill-through: through the bottom level of the cube to its back-end relational tables (using SQL)
-   Ranking: top-k or bottom-k items in a list ordered by some measure
-   Moving averages: over time
-   Statistical functions
-   Domain specific operators: growth rates, interest, internal rate of return, depreciation, currency conversion.
