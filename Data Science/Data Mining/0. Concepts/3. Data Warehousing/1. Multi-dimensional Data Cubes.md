-   A data warehouse is based on a **multidimensional data model** which views data in the form of a data cube
-   A data cube, such as _sales_, allows data to be modeled and viewed in multiple dimensions.
-   The cube axes are the **dimensions** such as item (e.g. item_name, brand, type), or time (e.g. day, week, month, quarter, year) or location (e.g. store, city, state, country) . The values of those dimensions (e.g. Item = home_entertainment, Quarter = Q4, City = Vancouver) uniqely identify a cube **cell**. 
-   The cube cells hold  the **measures** (such as dollars_sold,  quantity-sold and quantity-returned).

-   It is easy to see why this  structure is commonly called an (n-dimensional) _cube._  However, in data warehousing literature, this structure may be called a **cuboid** as a component of a more elaborate  **data cube.**     
-   An n-dimensional cuboid of unaggregated data is called a **base cuboid**.
-   Measures along one or more dimensions of the base cuboid may be aggregated to form another  cuboid with dimensions that are a subset of the original dimensions.
		-   The top-most 0-D cuboid, which holds the highest-level of summarisation in a single cell, is called the **apex cuboid,** commonly denoted _all_**.**  

-   **The lattice of cuboids forms a data cube.**
-   In this case the _all_ cuboid contains a single cell  that represents aggregated dollars_sold over all time, for all items,  at all locations and for every supplier.
-   An intermediate cuboid, for example the 2-D ( item, location) cuboid, will contain cells such as (Mars bar, Belconnen Mall) with measure $20,000, indicating that $20,000 worth of Mars Bars have been sold at the Belconnen Mall shop, over all time and for all suppliers.  
-   The bottom-most _base_ cuboid contains ||time|| x || item|| x || location|| x ||supplier|| cells, where each cell represents the dollars-sold for a possible combination of  specific values for time, item, location and supplier.
