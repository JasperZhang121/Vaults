**What is a Data Warehouse?**

-   Defined in many different ways, but not rigorously.
-   A decision support database that is maintained separately from the organisation’s operational database
-   Supports information processing by providing a solid platform of consolidated, historical data for analysis.
-   A data warehouse is a subject-oriented, integrated, time-variant, and nonvolatile collection of data in support of management’s decision-making process.”—W. H. Inmon
-   _Data warehousing_ is the process of constructing and using data warehouses

**Typical Characteristics  of a Data Warehouse**

**Subject-Oriented**

-   Organised around major subjects, such as customer, product, sales
-   Focusing on the modelling and analysis of data for decision makers, not on daily operations or transaction processing
-   Provides a simple and concise view around particular subject issues by excluding data that are not useful in the decision support process

**Integrated**

-   Constructed by integrating multiple, heterogeneous data source e.g. relational databases, flat files, on-line transaction records
-   Data cleaning and data integration techniques are applied.
    -   Ensure consistency in naming conventions, encoding structures, attribute measures, etc. among different data sources
    -   e.g., Hotel price: currency, tax, breakfast covered, etc.
    -   When data is moved to the warehouse, it is converted (this process is called _ETL_, for Extract, Transform, Load)

**Time Variant**

-   The time horizon for the data warehouse is significantly longer than that of operational systems
    -   Operational database: current value data
    -   Data warehouse data: provide information from a historical perspective (e.g., past 5-10 years)
-   Every key structure in the data warehouse
    -   Contains an element of time, explicitly or implicitly
    -   But the key of operational data may or may not contain “time element”

**Nonvolatile**

-   A physically separate store of data transformed from the operational environment
-   Operational update of data does not occur in the data warehouse environment
    -   Does not require transaction processing, recovery, and concurrency control mechanisms
    -   Requires only two operations in data accessing: Initial loading of data and access of data

**Comparison with typical operational databases:**

Most databases are used for **online transaction processing (OLTP)** and querying for day-to-day operations. On the other hand, data warehouses are built specifically for analytics to support decision making, that is, **online analytical processing (OLAP).**

The key difference between OLTP and OLAP is that OLTP is focused on capturing and processing transactions in real-time, while OLAP is focused on analyzing and reporting on data over a longer period of time. As such, data warehouses are typically used to support strategic decision-making processes, while operational databases are used for day-to-day operations.
