#### Lift

In addition to support and confidence which measure association, lift is used to evaluate patterns to measure dependence (also called correlation).

Lift

Inspired by probability theory, itemset $A$ is considered independent of itemset $B$ if $P(A\cup B) = P(A) \times P(B)$. Otherwise they are dependent and correlated.

Therefore we define the lift of rule $A\Longrightarrow B$ by

(support(A∪B))/(support(A)×support(B)).


The numerator is the probability of the customer purchasing both, while the denominator is what the probability of purchasing both would have been if the items were independent.

If $\text{lift} = 1$ then $A$ and $B$ are independent.

If $\text{lift} > 1$ then they are positively correlated as the presence of one suggests the presence of the other. In other words, it suggests that each lifts the likelihood of the other.

If $\text{lift} < 1$ the itemsets are negatively correlated and the occurrence of one itemset suggests the more likely absence of the other.
