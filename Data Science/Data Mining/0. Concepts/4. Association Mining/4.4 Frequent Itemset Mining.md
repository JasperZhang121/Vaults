Association mining can be viewed as a two-step process:

(1) Find all frequent itemsets--i.e. all the itemsets that occur at least $\mathit{min_sup} \times \mathit{cardinality~~of~~dataset}$ times in the dataset.

(2) Use the frequent itemsets to generate strong association rules that satisfy $\mathit{min_conf}$.

The first step is much more computationally demanding than the second, especially when $\mathit{min_sup}$ is low.
