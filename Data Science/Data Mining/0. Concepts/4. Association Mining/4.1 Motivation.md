-   Techniques were developed for commercial market basket analysis, which led to the birth of data mining and KDD from a database perspective in the 90s.
-   The language of frequent pattern mining assumes data items are grouped into transactions and aims to find patterns of items that occur in a high proportion of transactions.
-   An example is supermarket shopping, where mining revealed purchasers of nappies are also likely to purchase beer in the same transaction.
-   Frequent pattern mining is used in many other applications, such as the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, shopping basket analysis, cross marketing, catalogue design, sale campaign analysis, Web click stream analysis, and DNA sequence analysis.
-   Our work on frequent pattern mining focuses on association mining to learn patterns of association rules.
