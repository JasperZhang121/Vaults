The _Apriori algorithm_ is the archetypical algorithm for finding frequent itemsets.  

It implements an iterative level-wise search for frequent itemsets, where  the k-itemsets (itemsets of cardinality _k_) at level _k_ are used to explore the k+1-itemsets at level _k+1._ At each level, the transaction database is scanned to count items in transactions and  to collect the items that satisfy minimum support.

**Apriori Property**

The following observation is used to reduce the search space. This property is very closely related to the  _iceberg condition_ we saw in data cube materialisation.

**All non-empty subsets of a frequent itemset are also frequent**

Recall that a frequent itemset is one with at least  least  _min_sup_ support, i.e. one that occurs in at least _min_sup t_ransactions. Since each of its subsets occur in all those same transactions (and possibly in additional transactions as well),  the support of sub-itemsets cannot be less than _min_sup_ either.

A consequence of this is that **if an itemset is _not_ frequent, then any of its supersets cannot be frequent either** (otherwise the apriori property would be violated).

This can be used in a level-wise algorithm like the _apriori algorithm_ to reduce the search space, because any k+1-itemset with a non-frequent k-itemset subset (all of which have already been found in the previous iteration) can be ignored.
