IAM, EC2, S3, RDS, and Lambda are all popular AWS services. Here's a brief overview of each one:

1.  IAM (Identity and Access Management) is a service that allows you to manage access to AWS resources securely. With IAM, you can create and manage users, groups, and permissions to control who can access your AWS resources.
    
2.  EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a service that provides scalable computing capacity in the cloud. EC2 allows you to launch and manage virtual machines, called instances, and provides a wide range of configuration options, including operating systems, memory, storage, and networking.
    
3.  S3 (Simple Storage Service) is a service that provides secure, durable, and scalable object storage in the cloud. S3 allows you to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the internet, and provides advanced features such as lifecycle policies, versioning, and access control.
    
4.  RDS (Relational Database Service) is a service that provides scalable and managed database solutions in the cloud. RDS supports a range of popular database engines, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server, and provides features such as automated backups, monitoring, and replication.
    
5.  Lambda is a service that allows you to run code without provisioning or managing servers. With Lambda, you can write and run code in response to events, such as changes to data in an S3 bucket, or in response to HTTP requests. Lambda scales automatically to handle any amount of traffic, and you only pay for the compute time you consume.
