### Overview
Graph theory is a branch of mathematics concerned with the study of graphs, which are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between objects. A graph is made up of vertices (also called nodes or points) connected by edges (also called links or lines). This fundamental concept is applied across various fields, from computer science to biology and social science, providing a powerful framework for solving problems related to networked structures.

### Basic Concepts
#### Vertices and Edges
- **Vertices**: The fundamental units or points in a graph.
- **Edges**: The connections between vertices. Edges can be directed (showing a one-way relationship) or undirected (showing a bidirectional relationship).

#### Paths and Cycles
- **Path**: A sequence of edges that connects a sequence of vertices, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">with no vertex repeated</mark>.
- **Cycle**: A path in which the start and end vertices are the same, forming a loop.

#### Graph Types
- **Undirected Graphs**: Graphs where edges have no direction.
- **Directed Graphs**: Graphs where each edge has a direction associated with it.
- **Weighted Graphs**: Graphs where edges carry weights, representing costs, distances, or other metrics.

### Properties of Graphs

#### Degree, In-degree, and Out-degree
- **Degree**: The <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">number of edges connected to a vertex</mark> (in an undirected graph).
- **In-degree**: The number of edges coming <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">into</mark> a vertex (in a directed graph).
- **Out-degree**: The number of edges going <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">out</mark> from a vertex (in a directed graph).

#### Connectivity
- **Connected Graph**: An <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">undirected graph</mark> is connected if <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">there is a path between every pair of vertices</mark>.
- **Strongly Connected Graph**: A <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">directed graph</mark> is strongly connected if there is <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">a directed path</mark> from any vertex to every other vertex.

#### Planarity
- **Planar Graph**: A graph that can be drawn on a plane <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">without any edges crossing</mark>.

### Theorems and Principles

#### Euler's Theorems
- **Eulerian Path**: A path that visits <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">every edge exactly once</mark>.
- **Eulerian Circuit**: An Eulerian path that <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">starts and ends on the same vertex</mark>.

#### Hamiltonian Paths and Cycles
- **Hamiltonian Path**: A path that visits <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">every vertex exactly once</mark>.
- **Hamiltonian Cycle**: A Hamiltonian path that <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">starts and ends at the same vertex</mark>.

#### Graph Coloring
- **Graph Coloring**: Assigning colors to the vertices of a graph so that <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">no two adjacent vertices share the same color</mark>. This is related to the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">minimum number of colors needed</mark> for such an assignment.
