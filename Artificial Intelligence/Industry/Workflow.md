An **AI workflow** is the **sequence of steps** that transforms input (data, instructions, or environment signals) into an output (answer, action, or decision) through the use of models, reasoning, and tools. It defines **how AI agents or systems operate** from start to finish.
 
### Core Stages of an AI Workflow

#### Input

- **Source**: Human instructions, raw data, sensor readings, or events.
    
- **Format**: Natural language, structured queries, images, audio, etc.
    

_Example_: User asks → _“Find me the top 5 customers by revenue last month.”_

#### Understanding (Perception)

- The AI **interprets the input** using an LLM or specialized model.
    
- Converts natural language into **structured intent**.
    

_Example_: The system recognizes this is a **database query task**.


#### Reasoning & Planning

- The agent **decides what steps to take**:
    
    - Which tools to use.
        
    - In what order.
        
    - What data to retrieve or compute.
        
- Sometimes involves **chain-of-thought reasoning** or external planning logic.
    

_Example_: Plan = “Query SQL database → Sort by revenue → Return top 5.”

#### Tool/Action Execution

- The agent **calls tools, APIs, or external systems** to perform actions.
    
- Uses protocols like **MCP** to communicate with services.
    

_Example_:

```sql
SELECT customer_name, SUM(revenue) 
FROM sales 
WHERE month = '2025-07'
GROUP BY customer_name
ORDER BY SUM(revenue) DESC
LIMIT 5;
```


#### Integration & Post-Processing

- Collect results from tools.
    
- Format, summarize, or combine multiple outputs.
    

_Example_: Database returns rows → Agent turns them into a clean list or chart.

#### Output (Response/Action)

- Final delivery to the user.
    
- Can be **text, chart, audio, or direct action** (like sending an email).
    

_Example_:  
“Here are the top 5 customers by revenue last month: A, B, C, D, E.”

### Agent-Oriented Workflow

In an **Agent workflow**, the LLM sits in the middle:

1. **User request**
    
2. **Agent reasoning** (decide what to do)
    
3. **Tool invocation** (via MCP, APIs, databases)
    
4. **Interpret results**
    
5. **Respond or act**

### Types of AI Workflows

- **Static Workflow** – Fixed pipeline (e.g., image recognition: image → CNN → label).
    
- **Dynamic Workflow** – Agent decides steps at runtime (e.g., multi-tool reasoning).
    
- **Hybrid Workflow** – Predefined structure + agent flexibility.

### Example Scenarios

#### Example 1: Customer Support

- Input: _“Reset my password.”_
    
- Plan: Verify user → Call Reset API → Send email → Confirm success.
    
- Output: _“Your password has been reset and an email sent.”_
    

#### Example 2: Research Assistant

- Input: _“Summarize the latest papers on AI agents.”_
    
- Plan: Call Literature API → Summarize → Format results.
    
- Output: Markdown report.
    

#### Example 3: Travel Booking

- Input: _“Book me a flight Beijing → Tokyo and check hotel availability.”_
    
- Plan: Call Flight API → Call Hotel API → Combine.
    
- Output: Options for flights + hotels.

### Workflow + Nacos/MCP

- Without Nacos: The agent must **know every tool** in advance.
    
- With **Nacos MCP Router**:
    
    - Workflow simplifies → Agent connects to Router.
        
    - Router dynamically finds the right tools.
        
- This makes AI workflows **scalable and maintainable**.

**In summary**:
- AI workflow = Input → Understanding → Reasoning → Tool execution → Output.
- It can be static, dynamic, or hybrid.
- Agents + MCP help make workflows dynamic and flexible by automating tool discovery and usage.
