An **AI Agent** is an **LLM-powered system** that can **perceive an instruction, decide actions, call tools/APIs, and return results**. Compared to a normal chatbot, an agent is **action-oriented**: it doesn’t just answer with text—it **acts** by using external capabilities.

### Core Components of an Agent

1. **LLM Brain** – Understands natural language and makes decisions.
    
2. **Tools/Actions** – External services (APIs, databases, apps) the agent can use.
    
3. **Memory (optional)** – Stores context or history to make better decisions.
    
4. **Planner/Executor** – Logic that decides which tool to call, in what order, and how to use the results.

### How an Agent Works

1. **User request** → “What’s the weather in Tokyo tomorrow?”
    
2. **Agent reasoning** → Understands it needs weather data.
    
3. **Tool usage** → Calls a `WeatherService` API (via MCP).
    
4. **Result integration** → Interprets the API result.
    
5. **Final response** → “Tomorrow in Tokyo it will be 28°C with light rain.”

### Examples of AI Agents

#### Example 1: Personal Assistant Agent

- Input: _“Schedule a meeting tomorrow at 3 PM and send invites.”_
    
- Tools used: Calendar API, Email API.
    
- Output: Meeting booked, invites sent.
    

#### Example 2: Data Analyst Agent

- Input: _“Give me the top 10 customers by revenue this quarter.”_
    
- Tools used: SQL Database API, Chart Generator.
    
- Output: Ranked list and a chart.
    

#### Example 3: Travel Planner Agent

- Input: _“Find me a flight from Beijing to Tokyo and the weather there next week.”_
    
- Tools used: Flight Booking API, Weather API.
    
- Output: Flight options + weather forecast.

### Why Agents Matter

- **Normal Chatbot** → Only generates text answers.
    
- **Agent** → Can **act in the world**:
    
    - Query live data sources.
        
    - Perform transactions (book tickets, send emails).
        
    - Automate workflows.

This makes agents far more **practical** and **powerful** than plain LLMs.

### Agents + MCP

- MCP (Model Context Protocol) = the **standard bridge** between agents and tools.
    
- With **Nacos MCP Router**:
    
    - Agent connects to **one Router**.
        
    - Router introduces the agent to **many tools** (Weather, Stock, Calendar, etc.).
        
- This enables the **MCP Zero** pattern → one connection, infinite tools.
    
**In summary**:
- **Agent = AI brain + tools**.
- Agents differ from chatbots because they can **use tools to act**.
- MCP + Nacos help agents scale by simplifying how they discover and connect to tools.
