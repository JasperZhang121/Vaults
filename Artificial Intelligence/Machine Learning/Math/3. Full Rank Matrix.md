A full-rank matrix is a matrix that has a rank equal to its maximum possible rank. The rank of a matrix is the dimension of the linear space generated by its columns or rows. The maximum possible rank of a matrix is the minimum of its number of rows and columns. A matrix is said to be of full rank if it has the maximum possible rank for its size.

For example, if a matrix has `m` rows and `n` columns, its maximum rank is `min(m, n)`. If the matrix has rank `min(m, n)`, it is said to be of full rank. Full-rank matrices are important in linear algebra and machine learning because they have an inverse and can be used to solve systems of linear equations.

A matrix that is not full-rank is called a rank-deficient matrix. Rank-deficient matrices are not invertible and cannot be used to solve systems of linear equations.

Example:

```python
import numpy as np

# Full-rank matrix
A = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
print("Rank of A:", np.linalg.matrix_rank(A)) # Output: Rank of A: 2

# Rank-deficient matrix
B = np.array([[1, 2], [2, 4]])
print("Rank of B:", np.linalg.matrix_rank(B)) # Output: Rank of B: 1

```


In the case of an overdetermined system, where the data size `n` is larger than the number of variables `x`, it is possible for the matrix to be rank-deficient. However, it depends on the specific data and how the matrix is constructed. If the data is linearly dependent, the matrix will be rank-deficient, and a unique solution may not exist. On the other hand, if the data is linearly independent, the matrix will have full rank and a unique solution can be found.

In general, it's good practice to check the rank of the matrix before solving the system of equations to make sure that a unique solution exists. This can be done using matrix decomposition techniques or linear algebra libraries, such as `numpy` in Python.

One common approach to handle an overdetermined system is to use a least squares method, such as linear regression or polynomial regression. These methods aim to minimize the sum of the squared differences between the actual data points and the predicted values. By finding the coefficients that minimize this sum, the model can find the best approximation that fits the data.

Another approach is to use regularization, such as ridge regression or Lasso, to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization ability of the model. These methods introduce a penalty term to the objective function that discourages extreme coefficients and helps prevent overfitting.
