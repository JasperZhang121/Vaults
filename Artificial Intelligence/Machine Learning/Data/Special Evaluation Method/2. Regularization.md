Regularization is a technique used in machine learning to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization performance of models. Overfitting occurs when a model is too complex and captures the noise in the training data, leading to poor performance on unseen data.

Regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function, which discourages the model from fitting the noise in the data. The regularization term is controlled by a hyperparameter, which determines the strength of the regularization.

There are two common types of regularization in machine learning: L1 regularization and L2 regularization.

L1 regularization, also known as Lasso regularization, adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the absolute value of the coefficients of the model. This encourages the model to have sparse coefficients, with many coefficients being zero.

L2 regularization, also known as Ridge regularization, adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the coefficients of the model. This encourages the model to have small coefficients, which helps to prevent overfitting.

Regularization can be applied to linear regression, logistic regression, and other types of models, and it can help to improve the generalization performance of the model by reducing overfitting. However, it is important to choose the appropriate regularization strength, as too much regularization can result in underfitting, where the model is too simple to capture the patterns in the data.
