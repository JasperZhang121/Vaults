1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - **Missing Value Handling**: Address missing values by deleting rows/columns with missing data, filling in missing values (e.g., using mean, median, mode, or other algorithms), or predicting missing values.
   - **Noise Data Handling**: Identify and correct errors or biased values in the dataset.
   - **Outlier Handling**: Deal with outliers by deleting, correcting, or using statistical methods (such as IQR, Z-score).

2. **Data Integration**:
   - **Merging Data Sources**: Combine data from multiple sources into a consistent dataset.
   - **Resolving Data Conflicts**: Harmonize differences across data sources, such as different units of measurement or data formats.

3. **Data Transformation**:
   - **Normalization/Standardization**: Adjust data scales to a specific range (e.g., 0 to 1) or standardize data to have a 0 mean and unit variance for more efficient algorithm performance.
   - **Feature Construction**: Create new features from existing data to enhance the predictive power of the model.
   - **Discretization**: Convert continuous features into discrete values, which benefits certain types of models.

4. **Dimensionality Reduction**:
   - **Feature Selection**: Select the most relevant features to reduce dimensions and remove irrelevant or redundant features.
   - **Feature Extraction**: Use methods like Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), etc., to transform high-dimensional data into lower-dimensional data while retaining as much important information as possible.

5. **Data Encoding**:
   - **Categorical Data Encoding**: Convert textual or categorical data into numerical form, for example using One-Hot Encoding or Label Encoding.

6. **Data Sampling**:
   - **Balancing the Dataset**: Balance the distribution of classes in an imbalanced dataset by oversampling minority classes or undersampling majority classes.
   - **Splitting the Dataset**: Divide the data into training, validation, and test sets to evaluate model performance.
