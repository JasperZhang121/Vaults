also known as normalization or standardization, is a preprocessing step in machine learning that rescales the values of a feature to a common range. This is important because many machine learning algorithms, including linear regression and k-nearest neighbors, are sensitive to the scale of the input features and can lead to suboptimal performance or even failure to converge if the features have different ranges.

There are two common methods of feature scaling:

1.  Min-Max scaling: Also known as normalization, this method scales the values of a feature to a specified range, usually between 0 and 1. Min-Max scaling is performed by subtracting the minimum value of the feature from each value and dividing the result by the range of the feature (the difference between the minimum and maximum values).

	`x_scaled = (x - x_min) / (x_max - x_min)`

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

# Define a sample data array
X = np.array([[1], [2], [3], [4]])

# Create a MinMaxScaler object
scaler = MinMaxScaler()

# Fit and transform the data using the scaler object
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)

# Print the scaled data
print(X_scaled)

```


2.  Standardization: This method scales the values of a feature to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. Standardization is performed by subtracting the mean of the feature from each value and dividing the result by the standard deviation of the feature.

	`x_scaled = (x - x_mean) / x_std`

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Define a sample data array
X = np.array([[1], [2], [3], [4]])

# Create a StandardScaler object
scaler = StandardScaler()

# Fit and transform the data using the scaler object
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)

# Print the scaled data
print(X_scaled)
```
