A seasonal dummy is a binary (0 or 1) indicator variable used in time-series analysis to capture the seasonal effect in the data. For example, if the data has a yearly seasonal pattern, then one could create a binary variable to indicate the season, such as "Summer", "Fall", "Winter", and "Spring". The presence of seasonal dummies in the model helps to capture the seasonality of the data, which can help improve the accuracy of the predictions.

# Add the dummies to the data
data = pd.concat([data, dummies], axis=1)

# Split the data into training and test sets
