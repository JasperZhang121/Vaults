**Data Splitting:**

- **Generalization:** Data splitting is a fundamental concept in machine learning that helps in assessing how well a model will generalize to unseen data. It involves dividing a dataset into multiple subsets, each serving a specific purpose in the model development process.

**Training, Validation, and Test Sets:**

- **Training Set:** The training set is the largest portion of the dataset, typically around <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">70-80% of the data</mark>. It's used to train the machine learning model. The model learns patterns, features, and relationships in the data from this set.
    
- **Validation Set:** A portion of the data, <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">usually around 10-15%</mark>, is set aside as the validation set. It's used during training to tune hyperparameters and evaluate the model's performance. The validation set helps prevent overfitting (a model performing well on training data but poorly on unseen data) by providing an independent evaluation.
    
- **Test Set:** The test set is a separate portion, typically <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">10-20% of the data</mark>, used for the final evaluation of the trained model. It serves as a proxy for real-world, unseen data. The test set assesses how well the model will perform in practice. It should never be used during model development or tuning.
    

**Data Splitting for Cross-Validation:**

- **Cross-Validation (CV):** Cross-validation is a resampling technique used to assess how well a model will perform on an independent dataset. It involves dividing the dataset into several subsets or "folds." The model is trained and evaluated multiple times, with each fold serving as both the validation set and the test set at different iterations.
    
- **K-Fold Cross-Validation:** In K-Fold CV, the dataset is divided into K equal-sized folds. The model is trained K times, each time using K-1 folds for training and the remaining fold for validation. This process provides K different estimates of model performance, which can be averaged to obtain a more reliable evaluation.
    
- **Stratified Cross-Validation:** In cases where the dataset is imbalanced (one class significantly outnumbering others), <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">stratified cross-validation ensures that each fold maintains the same class distribution as the original dataset</mark>. This helps prevent bias in model evaluation.
    

**Key Takeaways:**

- Data splitting involves dividing the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
- The training set is used for model training.
- The validation set is used for hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation during training.
- The test set is reserved for the final model evaluation and should not be used during model development.
- Cross-validation is a technique for robustly estimating model performance by repeatedly splitting the data into training and validation subsets.

Proper data splitting and cross-validation are critical steps to ensure that machine learning models generalize well to new, unseen data and provide accurate and reliable results.
