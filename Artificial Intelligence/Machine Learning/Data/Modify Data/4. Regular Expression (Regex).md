**1. Basics:**

- Regular expressions are patterns used to <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">match character combinations in strings</mark>.
- In Python, the `re` module provides functions to work with regex.

**2. Simple Patterns:**

- `a`: Matches the character "a".
- `apple`: Matches the string "apple".

**3. Meta-characters (Special Characters):** These characters have special meanings when used in a regex pattern:

- `.`: Matches any character except a newline.
- `^`: Matches the start of a string.
- `$`: Matches the end of a string.
- `*`: Matches 0 or more repetitions of the preceding character or group.
- `+`: Matches 1 or more repetitions of the preceding character or group.
- `?`: Matches 0 or 1 repetition of the preceding character or group.
- `|`: Acts like an "OR" operator. E.g., `a|b` matches "a" or "b".
- `()`: Groups patterns together.

**4. Character Classes:**

- `[abc]`: Matches any one of the characters "a", "b", or "c".
- `[^abc]`: Matches any character except "a", "b", or "c".
- `[a-z]`: Matches any lowercase letter.
- `[A-Z]`: Matches any uppercase letter.
- `[0-9]`: Matches any digit.

**5. Predefined Character Classes:**

- `\d`: Matches any digit, equivalent to `[0-9]`.
- `\D`: Matches any non-digit.
- `\w`: Matches any alphanumeric character or underscore, equivalent to `[a-zA-Z0-9_]`.
- `\W`: Matches any non-alphanumeric character (opposite of `\w`).
- `\s`: Matches any whitespace character (spaces, tabs, line breaks).
- `\S`: Matches any non-whitespace character.

**6. Quantifiers:**

- `{n}`: Matches exactly n occurrences of the preceding character or group.
- `{n,}`: Matches n or more occurrences.
- `{n,m}`: Matches between n and m occurrences.

**7. Other Functions (Python's `re` module):**

- `re.search()`: Searches for a pattern in a string and returns a match object if found.
- `re.match()`: Checks if the beginning of a string matches a pattern.
- `re.findall()`: Returns all non-overlapping matches as a list.
- `re.sub()`: Replaces occurrences of a pattern with a specified string.

**8. Flags:**

- `re.I` or `re.IGNORECASE`: Makes the match case-insensitive.
- `re.M` or `re.MULTILINE`: Makes `^` and `$` match the start/end of each line.

**9. Common Uses:**

- Data validation (e.g., email, phone numbers).
- Text searching and replacing.
- Data extraction from logs or large volumes of text.
