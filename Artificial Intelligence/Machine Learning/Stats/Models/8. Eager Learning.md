Eager learning, also known as eager training, is a machine learning approach where the model is <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">trained on all available data in advance</mark>, before making any predictions. In eager learning, the model is built during the training phase, and the learned parameters are used directly for making predictions on new, unseen data.

One of the primary advantages of eager learning is that it allows for fast prediction times, as the model is pre-built and can make predictions immediately. Additionally, eager learning can be used to build complex models, as it allows for the incorporation of a large number of features and a wide range of learning algorithms.

However, eager learning also has some limitations. One drawback is that it can be computationally expensive to train a model on large datasets, especially when using complex learning algorithms. Additionally, the model can suffer from overfitting, as it is trained on all available data and may not generalize well to new data.

Examples of machine learning algorithms that use eager learning include decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting.
