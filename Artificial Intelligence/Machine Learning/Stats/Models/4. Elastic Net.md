Elastic Net is a linear regression algorithm that combines the properties of both Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression. It addresses overfitting problems caused by multicollinearity in the data by adding a penalty term to the least square loss function. The loss function for Elastic Net is defined as:

$Loss(y, y_{pred}) = \sum((y - y_{pred})^2) + \alpha * (1 - \lambda) * \sum(|w|) + \alpha * \lambda * \sum(w^2)$

where:

-   $y$ is the actual target value
-   $y_{pred}$ is the predicted value
-   $w$ is the vector of coefficients
-   $\alpha$ is the strength of the regularization term
-   $\lambda$ is the mixing parameter that determines the proportion of L1 and L2 penalty terms in the loss function

When $\lambda = 0$, Elastic Net reduces to Lasso Regression, and when $\lambda = 1$, it reduces to Ridge Regression. The optimal value of $\lambda$ can be determined using cross-validation or using a grid search.
