### Cosine Distance - Sparse & Dense Vectors

- **Sparse Vectors**:
  - Use the Coordinate list (COO) format, storing only non-zero elements with their row and column indices.
  - Example: `(0, 0) 2` and `(0, 3) 5` corresponds to the vector \[ 2, 0, 0, 5 \].
  - Common in text processing (e.g., TF-IDF vectors) and recommendation systems.
  - Other formats include CSR, CSC, and more.

- **Dense Vectors**:
  - Most elements are non-zero, typically stored in arrays or lists.
  - Example: \[ 1.2, 3.4, -0.5, 4.1, 5.6 \].
  - Used in physics, graphics, and machine learning.

- **Cosine Distance**:
  - Derived from cosine similarity: \(d = 1 - s\).
  - Ranges between 0 and 2; 0 indicates perfect alignment, and 2 indicates diametric opposition.
  - Used in machine learning, text processing, and recommendation systems.

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.sparse import csr_matrix, issparse
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_distances

def cosine_distance(v1, v2):
    if issparse(v1) and not issparse(v2):
        v2 = csr_matrix(v2)
    elif not issparse(v1) and issparse(v2):
        v1 = csr_matrix(v1)
    distance = cosine_distances(v1, v2)
    return distance
```
