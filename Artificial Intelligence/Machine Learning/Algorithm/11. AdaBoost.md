AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting) is a machine learning algorithm that combines multiple weak classifiers to create a strong classifier. It is particularly effective in binary classification tasks.

The main idea behind AdaBoost is to iteratively train a sequence of classifiers, where <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">each subsequent classifier focuses more on the misclassified samples from previous iterations</mark>.

Steps in the AdaBoost algorithm:

1.  Initialize weights for each training sample. Initially, all weights are <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">set equally to 1/N</mark>, where N is the number of samples.
    
2.  For each iteration: 
	1. a. Train a weak classifier on the training data using the current weights. 
	2. b. Evaluate the classifier's performance on the training data. 
	3. c. Calculate the <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">weighted error rate</mark> of the classifier, which measures how well it classifies the samples. 
	4. d. Compute the weight of the classifier based on its error rate. 
	5. e. Update the weights of the training samples, giving higher weights to the misclassified samples. 
	6. f. Normalize the weights to ensure they sum up to 1.
    
3.  Repeat the above steps for a fixed number of iterations or until a certain stopping criterion is met.
    
4.  Combine the individual weak classifiers into a strong classifier by assigning weights to each classifier based on their performance.
    
5.  To make predictions on new data, the AdaBoost classifier combines the predictions of all the weak classifiers using their assigned weights.
