Random Forest is a popular machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It is an ensemble method that <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">combines multiple decision trees to create a more accurate and stable model</mark>.

The algorithm works by <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">constructing a large number of decision trees</mark> during training and using them to make predictions. Each decision tree is constructed using a different subset of the training data, and a random subset of the features. This introduces randomness and diversity in the model, making it less prone to overfitting and more robust to noisy data.

To make a prediction for a new sample, the algorithm passes it through all the decision trees in the forest and takes the average (for regression) or the mode (for classification) of the outputs as the final prediction.

### Steps:

1.  **Data Preparation**: Prepare the dataset by cleaning, transforming, and encoding the features and labels.
    
2.  **Bootstrap Sampling**: Randomly select a subset of the data (with replacement) to build a decision tree.
    
3.  **Feature Selection**: Randomly select a subset of features to use for each decision tree.
    
4.  **Decision Tree Building**: Build a decision tree using the selected data and features.
    
5.  **Repeat**: Repeat steps 2-4 to build multiple decision trees.
    
6.  **Prediction**: For each test sample, predict the outcome by taking the majority vote of the predictions from all the decision trees.
    
7.  **Evaluate**: Evaluate the performance of the Random Forest model using appropriate metrics such as <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score</mark>.
    
8.  **Optimize**: Optimize the model by <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">adjusting hyperparameters such as the number of trees, the maximum depth of each tree, and the minimum number of samples required to split a node</mark>.
    
9.  **Test**: Test the optimized model on new data to ensure that it generalizes well and does not overfit.

### Advantages and Limitations

Some of the advantages of Random Forest are:

-   It is relatively <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">easy to use and can handle both categorical and numerical data</mark>.
-   It can handle high dimensional data and large datasets.
-   It is robust to outliers and missing values.
-   It can provide feature importance scores, indicating which features are most important for making predictions.

However, some of the limitations of Random Forest are:

-   It may <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">not perform well on imbalanced datasets</mark>.
-   It may not capture complex relationships between features.
-   It can be computationally expensive to train on large datasets.
-   It may not perform well on datasets with a large number of irrelevant features.
