Random Forest is a popular machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It is an ensemble method that <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">combines multiple decision trees to create a more accurate and stable model</mark>.

The algorithm works by constructing a large number of decision trees during training and using them to make predictions. Each decision tree is constructed using a different subset of the training data, and a random subset of the features. This introduces randomness and diversity in the model, making it less prone to overfitting and more robust to noisy data.

To make a prediction for a new sample, the algorithm passes it through all the decision trees in the forest and takes the average (for regression) or the mode (for classification) of the outputs as the final prediction.

Some of the advantages of Random Forest are:

-   It is relatively easy to use and can handle both categorical and numerical data.
-   It can handle high dimensional data and large datasets.
-   It is robust to outliers and missing values.
-   It can provide feature importance scores, indicating which features are most important for making predictions.

However, some of the limitations of Random Forest are:

-   It may not perform well on imbalanced datasets.
-   It may not capture complex relationships between features.
-   It can be computationally expensive to train on large datasets.
-   It may not perform well on datasets with a large number of irrelevant features.
