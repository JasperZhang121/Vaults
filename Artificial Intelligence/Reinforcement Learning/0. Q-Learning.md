Q-Learning is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">aims to find the optimal policy for a Markov decision process</mark> (MDP). In this algorithm, an agent learns to take optimal actions by learning the values of state-action pairs, known as Q-values. The Q-values represent the expected discounted reward that an agent will receive if it takes a particular action in a particular state. Q-Learning is a widely-used algorithm due to its simplicity, effectiveness, and ease of implementation.

### Architecture

Q-learning is a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">model-free reinforcement learning algorithm</mark> that uses a lookup table to store the expected value (Q-value) of each state-action pair. The Q-value represents the expected total reward for taking a particular action in a given state and following the optimal policy thereafter. The optimal policy is determined by selecting the action with the highest Q-value in each state.

### Training

Q-learning works by <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">iteratively updating the Q-values using the Bellman equation</mark>:

$Q(s, a) = r + γ max[Q(s', a')]$

where:

-   Q(s, a) is the Q-value for taking action a in state s.
-   r is the reward for taking action a in state s.
-   s' is the next state.
-   a' is the action that maximizes the Q-value in the next state.
-   γ is the discount factor, which determines the importance of future rewards.

The Q-values are initialized to arbitrary values and are updated using the Bellman equation after each time step.

### Applications

Q-learning has been used in a variety of applications, including game playing, robotics, and finance. One popular example is the game of Atari Breakout, where the goal is to break all the bricks by bouncing a ball off a paddle. Q-learning can be used to train an agent to learn an optimal policy for playing the game.

### Limitations

Q-learning has some limitations, including the curse of dimensionality and the need for a large amount of training data. The curse of dimensionality refers to the fact that the number of possible states and actions can become prohibitively large for complex problems, making it difficult to find an optimal policy. Q-learning can also suffer from the problem of overestimation, where the Q-values are overestimated due to the presence of noise in the training data.
