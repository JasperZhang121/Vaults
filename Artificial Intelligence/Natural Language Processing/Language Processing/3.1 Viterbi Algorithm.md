The Viterbi algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm used in various fields, including natural language processing (NLP) and speech recognition, to find the most likely sequence of hidden states (e.g., part-of-speech tags, states in a Hidden Markov Model) that generates a given sequence of observations (e.g., words, acoustic features).

The algorithm is based on the principle of <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">dynamic programming</mark> and makes use of the concept of optimal substructure, which states that an optimal solution to a larger problem can be constructed by combining optimal solutions to its smaller subproblems.

**Notation:**

- **N:** Number of possible hidden states.
- **T:** Length of the observation sequence.
- **q_i:** Hidden state i.
- **O_t:** Observation at time t.

**Algorithm Steps:**

1. **Initialization:**
    
    - Create a matrix V with dimensions (N x T), where V[i][t] represents the maximum probability of any path ending in hidden state q_i and generating observations O_1, O_2, ..., O_t.
    - Initialize the first column of V (V[:, 0]) with the initial probabilities of each hidden state multiplied by the emission probabilities for the first observation O_1.
2. **Recursion:**
    
    - For each time step t from 1 to T-1:
        - For each hidden state q_i at time t, calculate V[i][t] as the maximum of the probabilities of transitioning from any previous state q_j at time t-1 to q_i and multiplying it by the emission probability of the observation O_t for state q_i.
3. **Termination:**
    
    - The final probability of the most likely path is the maximum value in the last column of matrix V (i.e., max(V[:, T-1])).
    - Trace back the most likely path by following the highest probability transitions from the last column of V to the first column.

**Example:**

Let's illustrate the Viterbi algorithm with a simple example of part-of-speech tagging. We have a sequence of observations (words) and want to find the most likely sequence of part-of-speech tags for these words.

- Hidden states (part-of-speech tags): Noun (N), Verb (V), Adjective (Adj).
- Observation sequence (words): "I", "like", "green", "apples".

Assuming we have precomputed transition probabilities and emission probabilities, the Viterbi algorithm will calculate the most likely sequence of part-of-speech tags for the given observation sequence.
