**1. Text Processing:**

- Tokenization: Breaking text into smaller units (words, subword units) for analysis.
- Sentence Segmentation: Splitting text into sentences for processing.
- Stemming and Lemmatization: Reducing words to their base or root forms.
- Stop Word Removal: Eliminating common words with little semantic value.
- Spell Checking: Correcting spelling errors in the text.
- Punctuation Removal: Stripping punctuation marks from the text.
- Case Conversion: Converting text to lowercase or uppercase.
- Noise Removal: Removing irrelevant or noisy elements from text data.
- Normalization: Converting text to a standardized format (e.g., converting dates to a common format).
- Tokenization for Agglutinative Languages: Handling word segmentation in languages with complex morphology.

**2. Language Formalization & Understanding:**

- Part-of-Speech Tagging (POS Tagging): Assigning grammatical categories to words.
- Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identifying entities like names, locations, and organizations.
- Syntax and Dependency Parsing: Analyzing the grammatical structure of sentences.
- Coreference Resolution: Resolving references to the same entity in a text.
- Semantic Role Labeling: Identifying the roles of words in relation to predicates.
- Word Sense Disambiguation: Determining the correct meaning of ambiguous words.
- Sentiment Analysis: Identifying the sentiment or emotion expressed in text.
- Topic Modeling: Identifying themes or topics in a collection of documents.
- Question Answering: Automatically answering questions based on text data.
- Machine Translation: Translating text from one language to another.
- Information Extraction: Extracting structured information from unstructured text.
- Text Summarization: Generating concise summaries of longer text.
