NLP stands for Natural Language Processing, and it is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. NLP enables machines to understand, interpret, and generate natural language, allowing them to communicate with humans more effectively.

NLP can be broken down into two main components:

1. **Natural Language Understanding (NLU):** NLU is the part of NLP that deals with the <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">comprehension</mark> of human language by computers. It involves tasks such as speech <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">recognition, text understanding, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging, and parsing</mark>. NLU helps computers understand the meaning and context behind the words and phrases in a piece of text or speech.
    
2. **Natural Language Generation (NLG):** NLG is the part of NLP that focuses on the <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">generation of human-like language by machines</mark>. It involves tasks such as machine translation, text summarization, chatbot responses, and content generation. NLG allows computers to produce coherent and contextually appropriate sentences and paragraphs based on the given input or data.

### Four key aspects

1. **Syntax:** Syntax refers to the structure and arrangement of words or tokens in a sentence to form grammatically correct phrases or sentences. Understanding syntax is essential for tasks like part-of-speech tagging, parsing, and grammar checking. NLP models need to capture the relationships between words to comprehend the meaning of a sentence accurately.
    
2. **Semantics:** Semantics deals with the meaning of words, phrases, and sentences in a language. It involves understanding the context and the intended meaning behind the words. Tasks like word sense disambiguation, sentiment analysis, and information retrieval rely heavily on semantic understanding. NLP models aim to represent the semantic content of text to make accurate predictions and interpretations.
    
3. **Discourse:** Discourse refers to the organization and cohesion of sentences and ideas in a larger piece of text, such as paragraphs or documents. It involves understanding how sentences relate to each other and how they contribute to the overall message or topic. Coreference resolution, document summarization, and text generation are some NLP tasks that deal with discourse.
    
4. **Pragmatics:** Pragmatics goes beyond the literal meaning of words and takes into account the context, intentions, and implications of the speaker or writer. It deals with the pragmatic aspects of language use, including implicatures, presuppositions, and speech acts. NLP models must be sensitive to pragmatics to understand the true intent of a message and to generate contextually appropriate responses.
