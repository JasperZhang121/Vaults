Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) is a popular approach to machine translation that gained prominence in the early 2000s. It relies on statistical models and algorithms to translate text from one language to another. Here are some key notes about Statistical Machine Translation:

1. **Corpora-Based Approach:** SMT utilizes large bilingual text corpora, which are collections of parallel sentences in the source and target languages. These corpora serve as training data to build statistical models for translation.
    
2. **Phrase-Based Translation:** One of the fundamental units of translation in SMT is the phrase. Phrases are short sequences of words that frequently appear together in the bilingual corpora. Instead of translating word by word, SMT translates these phrases, which allows for better context preservation.
    
3. **Translation Model:** The translation model in SMT calculates the likelihood of translating a source language phrase into a target language phrase. This likelihood is learned from the bilingual corpora, and it helps determine the best translation for a given input.
    
4. **Alignment Model:** The alignment model identifies the correspondence between words or phrases in the source and target languages. It determines how different phrases align with each other in the parallel sentences of the bilingual corpora.
    
5. **Decoding:** During translation, SMT explores various possible translations and chooses the most likely translation based on the translation and alignment models. The process of selecting the best translation is known as decoding.
    
6. **N-gram Language Models:** To improve fluency and coherence of translations, SMT often incorporates n-gram language models. These models calculate the likelihood of word sequences in the target language based on monolingual text data.
    
7. **Limitations:** SMT may struggle with handling long-distance dependencies and preserving word order, especially in languages with different word orders. It can also encounter difficulties with translating idiomatic expressions and handling rare or unseen phrases.
    
8. **Advantages:** SMT was a significant advancement over rule-based machine translation, as it does not rely on handcrafted linguistic rules. It can leverage vast amounts of bilingual data and scale well with more data.
    
9. **Challenges in Training:** Training SMT models requires substantial computational resources and large parallel corpora. Additionally, the quality of translations heavily depends on the quality and size of the training data.
    
10. **Transition to Neural Machine Translation (NMT):** While SMT was a major breakthrough, Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has largely replaced it as the dominant approach due to its ability to capture complex patterns and contextual information more effectively.
