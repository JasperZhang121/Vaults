Machine translation is a subfield of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that focuses on developing automated systems or algorithms capable of translating text or speech from one language to another without human intervention. The goal of machine translation is to enable seamless communication between people who speak different languages, breaking down language barriers and fostering global understanding and collaboration.

There are different approaches to machine translation, and some of the commonly used methods include:

1. **Rule-based Machine Translation (RBMT):** In RBMT, linguistic experts create a set of rules and dictionaries that govern how a sentence is translated from one language to another. The translation process follows these predefined rules, which can be complex and time-consuming to build. While RBMT can provide accurate translations in specific domains, it may struggle with more complex sentences and nuances in natural language.
    
2. **Statistical Machine Translation (SMT):** SMT relies on statistical models and algorithms that learn from vast amounts of bilingual text corpora. These models identify patterns and associations between words and phrases in different languages to make translations. SMT was a significant improvement over RBMT and became popular in the early 2000s.
    
3. **Neural Machine Translation (NMT):** NMT is a more recent and currently dominant approach to machine translation. It uses deep learning techniques, particularly neural networks, to process entire sentences or sequences of words simultaneously. NMT models can capture complex patterns and contextual information, leading to more fluent and accurate translations. They outperform traditional SMT models in most scenarios.
