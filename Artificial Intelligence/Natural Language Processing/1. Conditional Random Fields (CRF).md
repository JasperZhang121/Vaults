### Architecture

Conditional Random Fields (CRF) are a type of <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">graphical model</mark> that is used to model sequential data, such as speech or text. CRFs are designed to <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">model the conditional probability distribution of a sequence of labels</mark>, given a sequence of observed data. The basic architecture of a CRF consists of a set of observed features, which are used to make predictions about the labels, and a set of hidden variables, which represent the labels themselves.

### Training

CRFs are typically trained using <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)</mark>, which involves finding the model parameters that maximize the likelihood of the training data. This can be done using iterative optimization algorithms such as gradient descent or L-BFGS. During training, the model learns to assign higher probabilities to sequences of labels that are more likely to occur in the training data.

### Applications

CRFs have been used in a variety of applications, including speech recognition, named entity recognition, and part-of-speech tagging. One advantage of CRFs over other sequence labeling models, such as Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), is that they can incorporate a larger number of features, including higher-order dependencies between labels.

### Limitations

One limitation of CRFs is that they can be computationally expensive to train and evaluate, especially when dealing with large datasets or models with many parameters. In addition, CRFs are often prone to overfitting, which can lead to poor generalization performance on new data.

Despite these limitations, CRFs remain a popular choice for many sequence labeling tasks, and they have been successfully applied in a wide range of domains.
