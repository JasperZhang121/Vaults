Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are statistical models used to analyze <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">time-series data in which the underlying system being studied is assumed to be a Markov process with hidden states</mark>. They are commonly used in speech recognition, natural language processing, bioinformatics, and many other fields.

### Architecture

An HMM is a doubly stochastic process that models both the observed output and the hidden state of a system. The model consists of a set of states, each of which emits an observation, and a set of transitions between the states. <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">The transitions between states are probabilistic and are determined by a transition matrix</mark>, which specifies the probability of moving from one state to another. The observations emitted by each state are also probabilistic and are determined by an emission matrix, which specifies the probability of observing a particular output given the current state.

### Training

Training an HMM typically involves estimating the parameters of the transition and emission matrices from a set of training data. One common approach is the <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Baum-Welch algorithm</mark>, which uses the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to iteratively estimate the parameters of the model.

### Applications

HMMs have many applications, including speech recognition, where they are used to model the phoneme sequence of spoken words, and bioinformatics, where they are used to analyze DNA and protein sequences. HMMs can also be used in natural language processing to model the sequence of words in a sentence and to perform part-of-speech tagging.

### Limitations

One limitation of HMMs is that they assume that the system being modeled is a Markov process, which may not always be the case. In addition, the performance of HMMs can be sensitive to the choice of model parameters and the quality of the training data. Finally, HMMs are computationally intensive, which can limit their applicability in real-time systems.

### Process

1.  Define the states: The first step is to define the states of the system. These can represent anything from physical states (e.g., position, velocity) to abstract states (e.g., emotions, intentions).
    
2.  Define the observations: Next, we define the observations that we can make about the system. These are often noisy or incomplete measurements of the underlying states.
    
3.  Define the initial state probabilities: We specify the probability distribution over the initial state of the system. $$P(q_1=s_i)=\pi_i$$where $\pi_i$ is the probability of the system starting in state $s_i$.
    
4.  Define the state transition probabilities: We define the probability of transitioning from one state to another, given the current state. $$P(q_t=s_j|q_{t-1}=s_i)=a_{ij}$$ where $a_{ij}$ is the probability of transitioning from state $s_i$ to state $s_j$.
    
5.  Define the observation probabilities: We define the probability of observing a given observation, given the current state.1.  $$P(o_t=v_k|q_t=s_i)=b_i(k)$$
    where $b_i(k)$ is the probability of observing output symbol $v_k$ given that the system is in state $s_i$.
    
6.  Training the model: We use the training data to estimate the parameters of the model, i.e., the state transition probabilities and the observation probabilities.
    
7.  Inference: Once we have trained the model, we can use it to perform inference, i.e., given a sequence of observations, we can infer the most likely sequence of states that generated those observations.
    
8.  Applications: HMMs have a wide range of applications, including speech recognition, machine translation, and bioinformatics.
