**What is Semantics?**
- Semantics deals with the study of meaning in language. It aims to understand how words, phrases, and sentences convey meaning, both in isolation and when combined in context.
- Modelling semantics is the holy grail of NLP and a central question in Artificial Intelligence

**Logical Semantics:**
- Focuses on representing the meaning of sentences in a formal system, often using symbolic logic.
- Constructs like propositions, truth values (true or false), and logical operators (AND, OR, NOT) are used.
- Examines how the truth values of larger expressions depend on the truth values of their parts.

**Predicate-Argument Semantics:**
- Concerns itself with predicates and their arguments.
  - Predicates: Verbs or adjectives that indicate properties or actions.
  - Arguments: Entities (often nouns) that participate in the actions or have the properties described by the predicates.
- For instance, in "John reads a book", "reads" is the predicate, and "John" and "a book" are its arguments.

**Lexical Semantics:**
- Explores the meaning of words and the relationships between them.
- Studies phenomena like synonymy (words with similar meanings, e.g., "happy" and "joyful"), antonymy (opposite meanings, e.g., "happy" and "sad"), and hyponymy (hierarchical relationships, e.g., "sparrow" is a hyponym of "bird").
- Also includes the study of word senses and ambiguity.

**Coreference Resolution:**
- Focuses on identifying which nouns in a text refer to the same entities in the real world.
- An example is resolving "he" to "John" in the sentences: "John went to the park. He sat on a bench."
- Essential for understanding context and maintaining coherence in discourse.
