**What is Semantics?**
- Semantics deals with the <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">study of meaning in language</mark>. It aims to understand how words, phrases, and sentences convey meaning, both in isolation and when combined in context.
- Modelling semantics is the holy grail of NLP and a central question in Artificial Intelligence
	- Building a robot that can follow natural language instructions to execute tasks
	- Answering questions, such as where is the nearest coffee shop? 
	- Translating a sentence from one language into another, while preserving the underlying meaning 
	- Fact-checking an article by searching the web for contradictory evidence 
	- Logic-checking an argument by identifying contradictions, ambiguity, and unsupported assertions
- Semantic theories explain how to linguistically represent meaning: 
	- Logical semantics 
	- Lexical semantics

**Logical Semantics:**
- Focuses on representing the meaning of sentences in a formal system, often using symbolic logic.
- Constructs like propositions, truth values (true or false), and logical operators (AND, OR, NOT) are used.
- Examines how the truth values of larger expressions depend on the truth values of their parts.

**Predicate-Argument Semantics:**
- Concerns itself with predicates and their arguments.
  - Predicates: Verbs or adjectives that indicate properties or actions.
  - Arguments: Entities (often nouns) that participate in the actions or have the properties described by the predicates.
- For instance, in "John reads a book", "reads" is the predicate, and "John" and "a book" are its arguments.

**Lexical Semantics:**
- Explores the meaning of words and the relationships between them.
- Studies phenomena like synonymy (words with similar meanings, e.g., "happy" and "joyful"), antonymy (opposite meanings, e.g., "happy" and "sad"), and hyponymy (hierarchical relationships, e.g., "sparrow" is a hyponym of "bird").
- Also includes the study of word senses and ambiguity.

Homonymy: coincidentally share an orthographic form. e.g. bank
- The bank took my deposit. (financial institution) 
- The bank was grassy. (sloping mound) 
Polysemy: two senses are semantically related. e.g. solution 
- Work out the solution in your head. 
- Heat the solution to 75° Celsius.  
Homophone: same pronunciation, but different spellings.  e.g., wood / would, to / two 
Homograph: same orthographic form, but different pronunciation (this is a problem in speech synthesis). e.g. bass
- I like to play the bass (a musical instrument – bass guitar)
- Fresh bass is tasty (a fish)

**Coreference Resolution:**
- Focuses on identifying which nouns in a text refer to the same entities in the real world.
- An example is resolving "he" to "John" in the sentences: "John went to the park. He sat on a bench."
- Essential for understanding context and maintaining coherence in discourse.
