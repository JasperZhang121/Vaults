This algorithm performs an efficient intersection of two sorted lists, p1 and p2, to find their common elements. The algorithm<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;"> runs in linear time, which means its time complexity is proportional to the total number of elements in both lists</mark>.

**Input:**

- p1: A sorted list (e.g., array, linked list) containing elements in ascending order.
- p2: Another sorted list (e.g., array, linked list) containing elements in ascending order.

**Output:**

- intersection_result: A list containing the <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">common elements present in both p1 and p2</mark>.

**Algorithm Steps:**

1. Initialize two pointers, i and j, to the beginning of p1 and p2, respectively.
2. Create an empty list, intersection_result, to store the common elements.
3. While both pointers are within the bounds of their respective lists, repeat steps 4 to 6.
4. If the element at p1[i] is equal to the element at p2[j], add it to the intersection_result, and move both pointers (i and j) to the next element in their respective lists.
5. If the element at p1[i] is smaller than the element at p2[j], move pointer i to the next element in p1.
6. If the element at p1[i] is greater than the element at p2[j], move pointer j to the next element in p2.
7. If either pointer reaches the end of its list, exit the loop.
8. Return the intersection_result containing the common elements.

**Pseudocode:**
```python
function intersection(p1, p2):
    i = 0
    j = 0
    intersection_result = []

    while i < len(p1) and j < len(p2):
        if p1[i] == p2[j]:
            intersection_result.append(p1[i])
            i += 1
            j += 1
        elif p1[i] < p2[j]:
            i += 1
        else:
            j += 1

    return intersection_result
```
