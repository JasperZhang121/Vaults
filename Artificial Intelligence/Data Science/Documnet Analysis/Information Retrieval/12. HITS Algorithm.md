## Introduction
- Introduced by **Jon Kleinberg** in 1999.
- Determines two measures for webpages: **Authority** and **Hub** values.
  - **Authorities**: Pages with quality content frequently referred to.
  - **Hubs**: Pages that link out to many other pages.

## Process

### Preliminaries
- Start with a query to obtain a focused subgraph of the web (the "base set").
  - Contains pages with query terms.
  - Contains pages linking to/from the pages with the query terms.

### Initialization
- Every page gets two scores:
  - **Hub score (h)**: Initially 1.
  - **Authority score (a)**: Initially 1.

### Iterative Algorithm

#### Authority Update Step
For each page `p`:
$\ a(p) = \sum_{q \to p} h(q)$
(Sum of hub scores of all pages `q` pointing to `p`.)

#### Hub Update Step
For each page `p`:
$\ h(p) = \sum_{p \to q} a(q)$
(Sum of authority scores of all pages `q` that `p` points to.)

### Normalization
- Normalize authority scores: Sum of the squares of authority scores = 1.
- Normalize hub scores: Sum of the squares of hub scores = 1.

### Convergence
- Repeat steps 3 and 4 until scores converge (changes between iterations are minimal).

### Outcome
- Pages with highest authority scores = authoritative on the query.
- Pages with highest hub scores = best hubs for the query.

## Notes:
- **Query-dependent**: Scores are relative to a specific query and its base set.
- Works best for broad queries with many potential authoritative pages and hubs.
- Need to recompute base set and scores for different queries.
