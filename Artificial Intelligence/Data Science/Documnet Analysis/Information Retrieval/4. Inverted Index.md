An inverted index is a data structure used in information retrieval systems to efficiently map terms (words) to the documents that contain them. It allows for <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">quick and effective searching of documents based on specific terms</mark>, enabling faster retrieval of relevant information from a large collection of documents.

### Structure of an Inverted Index:

An inverted index is typically implemented as <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">a dictionary (or hash table)</mark> where each entry corresponds to a unique term. For each term, the entry contains a list of document identifiers (IDs) or pointers to the documents that contain that term (sorted ascending order).

**Example:**

Let's consider a small example with three documents (D1, D2, and D3) and six unique terms (T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, and T6). The inverted index might look like this:

```
        Term    Documents
        T1      D1, D2
        T2      D1, D3
        T3      D2, D3
        T4      D1, D2, D3
        T5      D2
        T6      D3
```

**Interpretation:**

- Term T1 appears in documents D1 and D2.
- Term T2 appears in documents D1 and D3.
- Term T3 appears in documents D2 and D3.
- Term T4 appears in documents D1, D2, and D3.
- Term T5 appears in document D2.
- Term T6 appears in document D3.

**Use in Information Retrieval:**

During the search process, when a user submits a query containing terms, the information retrieval system refers to the inverted index to <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">quickly identify the documents that contain those terms</mark>. It then retrieves and ranks the relevant documents based on their relevance to the query.

**Benefits of Inverted Index:**

1. **Fast Retrieval:** The inverted index allows for <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">fast retrieval of documents containing specific terms</mark>. Instead of scanning the entire document collection, the system can directly access the relevant documents based on the terms in the query.
    
2. **Reduced Storage Requirements:** Inverted indexes are <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">space-efficient</mark>, particularly for large collections, as they store only the term-document mappings, avoiding duplication of terms across documents.
    
3. **Scalability:** Inverted indexes are scalable and can handle large document collections effectively, making them suitable for modern information retrieval systems and web search engines.
    

**Inverted Index Construction:**

Building an inverted index involves processing the entire document collection to extract terms and their occurrences in each document. <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">The process typically includes tokenization, stemming (reducing words to their root form), and stop word removal (excluding common words like "the," "and," etc.). </mark>The resulting terms are then mapped to their corresponding documents in the inverted index.

### Storation

In an inverted index, each term (word) in the document collection is associated with a <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">posting list that contains information about the documents in which the term appears</mark>. The posting list records the identifiers of these documents, commonly referred to as docIDs or document serial numbers.

**Storing Lists of Documents:** For each term "t", the inverted index must <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">store a list of all documents that contain "t"</mark>. This is accomplished by creating a posting list that maintains the docIDs of the relevant documents. The posting list acts as a link between the term and the documents in which it occurs.

**Variable-Size Postings Lists:** The size of the posting list for each term can vary significantly, depending on factors such as the term's frequency and the number of documents containing the term. Some terms may appear in many documents, resulting in larger posting lists, while others may be less common and have smaller posting lists.

**On Disk Storage:** When storing the inverted index on disk, it is <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">beneficial to keep the posting lists contiguous</mark>. A contiguous run of postings is considered the norm and is generally the most efficient way to store data on disk. Contiguous storage <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">minimizes disk seek times and allows for efficient block-level reads, enhancing overall retrieval performance</mark>.

**In Memory Storage:** In memory, the storage considerations are different. <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">While contiguous runs are optimal on disk, they might not be the most efficient choice in memory due to variable-size posting lists</mark>. In memory, data structures such as linked lists or variable-length arrays can be used to represent the posting lists for each term.

- **Linked Lists:** Each node in the linked list represents a document containing the term, and the nodes are connected through pointers. Linked lists allow for flexible memory allocation and are suitable when the size of the posting list is not known in advance.
    
- **Variable Length Arrays:** <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Variable-length arrays are data structures that can dynamically resize to accommodate the number of documents in the posting list</mark>. This enables efficient memory usage while allowing for fast access to elements in the posting list.

**Balancing Disk and Memory Efficiency:** In designing an information retrieval system, a<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;"> trade-off exists between optimizing disk storage and memory efficiency</mark>. For disk storage, contiguous runs of postings are preferred, while in memory, data structures that efficiently manage variable-size posting lists are employed.

### Indexer Step

The indexer is a crucial component in an information retrieval system <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">responsible for building the inverted index</mark>, which efficiently maps terms to the documents that contain them. The indexing process involves several steps, and here is an explanation of each step:

**1. Token Sequence:** The first step of the indexer is to <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">tokenize the documents in the collection</mark>. Tokenization involves breaking the text into individual units called tokens, which can be words, phrases, or other meaningful elements. The token sequence represents the extracted terms from the documents.

**2. Sort Tuples by Terms (and then DocID):** After tokenization, the <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">indexer creates tuples (term, docID) for each occurrence of a term in a document</mark>. Each tuple consists of the term and the identifier (ID) of the document where the term appears. The tuples are then sorted primarily by the terms and, if necessary, by the docID, ensuring that all occurrences of the same term are grouped together.

**3. Merge Multiple Term Entries in a Single Document:** In some cases, a single document may contain multiple occurrences of the same term. To save space and improve efficiency, the indexer <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">merges the multiple tuples for the same term</mark> within a document into a single entry. The merged entry typically contains the term and a list of docIDs where the term appears in that document.

**4. Split into Dictionary and Postings:** The sorted and merged tuples are then <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">split into two components: the dictionary and the postings</mark>.

- **Dictionary:** The dictionary is a data structure that <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">contains the unique terms from the collection</mark>. Each term in the dictionary is associated with a pointer or offset that leads to the corresponding posting list for that term.
    
- **Postings:** The postings <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">store the information about which documents contain each term</mark>. For each term, the postings list includes the docIDs where the term appears. The postings can be represented using <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">various data structures, such as arrays, linked lists, or compressed formats, to optimize memory usage and retrieval efficiency</mark>.    

**5. Doc Frequency Information is Added:** The document frequency (df) information is added to each entry in the postings list. Document frequency indicates the number of documents in the collection that contain a specific term. This information is essential for calculating term frequencies, inverse document frequencies, and relevance scores during the information retrieval process.

#### Example

Let's consider a small example to illustrate the steps of the indexer in building the inverted index. We have a collection of four documents (D1, D2, D3, and D4) with the following token sequences:

```
D1: "apple orange apple"
D2: "orange banana"
D3: "apple grape"
D4: "banana grape"
```

**Step 1: Token Sequence:** The token sequences represent the terms extracted from each document after tokenization:

```
D1: "apple", "orange", "apple"
D2: "orange", "banana"
D3: "apple", "grape"
D4: "banana", "grape"
```

**Step 2: Sort Tuples by Terms (and then DocID):** Sorting the tuples by terms and then by docID gives us:

```
("apple", D1)
("apple", D3)
("banana", D2)
("banana", D4)
("grape", D3)
("grape", D4)
("orange", D1)
("orange", D2)
```

**Step 3: Merge Multiple Term Entries in a Single Document:** We merge multiple tuples with the same term within a document:

```
("apple", D1, D3)
("banana", D2, D4)
("grape", D3, D4)
("orange", D1, D2)
```

**Step 4: Split into Dictionary and Postings:** The dictionary contains unique terms and their pointers to the corresponding postings lists:

```
Dictionary:
"apple" -> pointer to postings list
"banana" -> pointer to postings list
"grape" -> pointer to postings list
"orange" -> pointer to postings list
```

The postings lists contain the docIDs where each term appears:

```
Postings Lists:
"apple": D1, D3
"banana": D2, D4
"grape": D3, D4
"orange": D1, D2
```

**Step 5: Doc Frequency Information is Added:** Document frequency (df) information is added to each entry in the postings list:

```
Postings Lists with df:
"apple": df=2, postings=D1, D3
"banana": df=2, postings=D2, D4
"grape": df=2, postings=D3, D4
"orange": df=2, postings=D1, D2
```

**Final Inverted Index:** The final inverted index is represented using the dictionary and postings lists:

```
Inverted Index:
Dictionary:
"apple" -> postings=D1, D3, df=2
"banana" -> postings=D2, D4, df=2
"grape" -> postings=D3, D4, df=2
"orange" -> postings=D1, D2, df=2
```
