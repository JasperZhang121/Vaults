  
Performing information retrieval in the classic search model involves several steps, from understanding the user's task and information needs to refining the initial query based on the search results. 

1. **User Task:** Identify the user's task or goal, which involves determining the purpose of the search. Users may have various tasks, such as seeking information, finding relevant documents, answering a specific question, or exploring a topic.
    
2. **Information Need:** Understand the user's information need by analyzing their query or request. Information needs can be explicit (specifically stated by the user) or implicit (inferred from the context of the search).
    
3. **Query:** Formulate a query based on the user's information need. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">The query is a string of keywords or phrases that represent the user's search request</mark>. It should be constructed to capture the most relevant aspects of the user's information need.
    
4. **Search Engine:** Submit the query to a search engine. A search engine is a specialized software that retrieves relevant documents from a large collection based on the query. The search engine uses indexing and ranking algorithms to find and present the most relevant documents to the user.
    
5. **Results:** The search engine returns a set of search results, which are documents or web pages that are considered relevant to the user's query. The search results are typically ranked based on their perceived relevance to the query.
    
6. **Query Refinement:** Review the search results to assess their relevance to the user's information need. If the initial search results are not satisfactory, the user may refine their query by modifying the keywords, adding more context, or using advanced search operators.
    
7. **Iterative Process:** Information retrieval is often an iterative process. If the user's information need is not fully satisfied with the initial search results, they may iterate through the query refinement step multiple times until they find the desired information.

**User Interaction and Feedback:** Throughout the process, user interaction and feedback play a crucial role in improving the relevance of search results. Users can provide explicit feedback (e.g., relevance judgments) or implicit feedback (e.g., click-through behavior) to help the search engine better understand their preferences and information needs.

**Continual Improvement:** Search engines continuously learn and improve by analyzing user interactions, click-through rates, and user feedback. This data is used to update search algorithms, refine rankings, and enhance the overall search experience.

Performing information retrieval in the classic search model involves a combination of user understanding, query formulation, search engine utilization, and iterative refinement, with the ultimate goal of providing relevant and accurate information to meet the user's information needs.
