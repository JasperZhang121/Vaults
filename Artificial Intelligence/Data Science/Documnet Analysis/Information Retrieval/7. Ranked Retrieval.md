Ranked retrieval is a technique used in information retrieval systems to retrieve and present search results in order of relevance, where the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">most relevant documents are ranked higher than less relevant ones</mark>. The goal of ranked retrieval is to provide users with the most pertinent information quickly and efficiently, especially when dealing with large collections of documents.

**Key Concepts of Ranked Retrieval:**

1. **Scoring Function:**
    
    - In ranked retrieval, each document is assigned a score based on its relevance to the user's query. <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">The scoring function calculates the relevance score by considering various factors, such as term frequency (TF), inverse document frequency (IDF), document length normalization, and other relevance metrics</mark>.
    - The scoring function aims to measure how well the document matches the query and how important the terms in the document are within the context of the entire document collection.
2. **Ranking Algorithm:**
    
    - A ranking algorithm is used to sort the documents based on their <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">relevance scores in descending order</mark>. The most relevant documents are ranked higher and presented at the top of the search results.
    - Common ranking algorithms include the <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Vector Space Model (VSM), Okapi BM25, and language models</mark>.
3. **Query Processing:**
    
    - When a user submits a query, the information retrieval system processes the query and identifies the relevant documents using the scoring function.
    - The system then ranks the documents based on their relevance scores to present the most relevant results first.
4. **User Interaction:**
    
    - Ranked retrieval allows users to <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">interact with the search results by exploring documents at different ranks</mark>. Users can refine their queries, view additional results, or adjust the relevance criteria based on the presented rankings.

### Weighted field scoring

A technique used in information retrieval systems to rank and score documents based on their relevance to a user's query while<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;"> considering different fields (attributes) of the documents</mark>. Unlike traditional ranked retrieval, where a single relevance score is computed for each document, weighted field scoring assigns different weights to each field based on its importance in the query and relevance evaluation.

**Key Concepts of Weighted Field Scoring:**

1. **Query with Multiple Fields:**
    
    - In weighted field scoring, a user's query can include multiple search fields, each targeting a specific attribute of the documents. For example, a search query might have separate fields for <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">title, content, author, and date</mark>.
2. **Field Weights:**
    
    - Each search <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">field is assigned a weight that represents its importance</mark> in the query. Fields with higher weights contribute more to the overall relevance score of a document.
    - Field weights can be assigned manually based on domain knowledge or learned automatically from training data using machine learning algorithms.
3. **Scoring Function:**
    
    - The scoring function in weighted field scoring calculates the relevance score of each document for each search field individually.
    - The relevance score for each field is then multiplied by its corresponding field weight to reflect its importance in the overall document ranking.
4. **Aggregation of Field Scores:**
    
    - The <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">relevance scores obtained for each field are aggregated to compute the final document score</mark>. This can be achieved through various aggregation methods, such as weighted summation or other combination techniques.

**Example:**

Suppose we have a document collection with fields such as <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"Title," "Content," and "Author."</mark> A user submits a query with different weights assigned to each field. For example:

- Query: "machine learning"
- Field Weights: Title (0.6), Content (0.8), Author (0.4)

The scoring function computes the relevance scores for each document in each field based on the query terms and assigns the corresponding weights. The final document score is obtained by aggregating the weighted scores from all the fields.
