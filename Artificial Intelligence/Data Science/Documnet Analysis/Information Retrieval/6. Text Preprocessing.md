Text preprocessing is a crucial step in natural language processing (NLP) that involves transforming raw text data into a clean and structured format suitable for further analysis and machine learning tasks. Preprocessing helps to remove noise, inconsistencies, and irrelevant information from the text, making it easier for NLP models to understand and extract meaningful insights. Check [[1. Pipeline]]

The text preprocessing pipeline typically includes the following steps:

**1. Tokenization:** Tokenization is the process of breaking the text into individual words or tokens. It involves <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">splitting the text based on spaces or punctuation</mark> marks to create a sequence of meaningful units for analysis.

**2. Lowercasing:** Converting all text to <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">lowercase</mark> helps in standardizing the text and reducing the vocabulary size. This ensures that words with the same meaning but different cases (e.g., "apple" and "Apple") are treated as the same token.

**3. Removing Punctuation:** Punctuation marks (e.g., periods, commas, exclamation marks) are often unnecessary for many NLP tasks. <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Removing punctuation simplifies the text and reduces the vocabulary size without sacrificing meaningful information</mark>.

**4. Removing Stopwords:** Stopwords are common words that occur frequently in a language (e.g., "the," "and," "is"). These words often do not contribute much to the meaning of the text and can be removed to reduce noise and improve processing speed.

**5. Stemming or Lemmatization:** Stemming and lemmatization are techniques used to reduce words to their base or root form. <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Stemming chops off word suffixes (e.g., "running" to "run")</mark>, while <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">lemmatization transforms words to their dictionary form (e.g., "better" to "good")</mark>. These techniques help to reduce inflectional forms and consolidate related words.

**6. Removing Numbers and Special Characters:** In some cases, <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">numbers and special characters may not be relevant for NLP tasks</mark>, so they can be removed to simplify the text further.

**7. Handling Contractions and Abbreviations:** Contractions (e.g., "don't" for "do not") and abbreviations (e.g., "USA" for "United States of America") may be <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">expanded to their full forms</mark> for better understanding.

**8. Spell Checking and Correction:** In some cases, <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">spell checking and correction</mark> can be applied to fix common spelling errors and typos.

**9. Encoding and Vectorization:** After preprocessing, the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">text is typically encoded into numerical representations, such as one-hot encoding or word embeddings</mark>, to be processed by machine learning models.
