### Web Basics

- **Nodes**: These represent <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">entities</mark> such as documents, people, or organizations.
    
- **Edges**: Represent <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">relationships between nodes</mark>. Examples include hyperlinks and co-authorship relations.
    
- **Direction of Edges**: Edges can be directional, implying they move from one node to another in a specified direction.
    

#### Degree of a Node

- **Degree**: Represents the number of <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">edges connected</mark> to a node.
    
- **In-degree**: Denotes the number of <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">incoming</mark> edges to a node.
    
- **Out-degree**: Denotes the number of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">outgoing</mark> edges from a node.
    

### Link Analysis

- **Overview**: Link analysis utilizes the <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">web graph's structure to enhance search functionality</mark>.
    
- **Significance**: It's one of the revolutionary advancements in web search. Google's initial success is attributed in part to its innovative link analysis techniques.
    

### Citation Analysis

#### Bibliometrics

- **Concept**: Many documents feature bibliographies that cite earlier publications. When these <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">citations are viewed as edges, a collection of documents can form a graph</mark>.
    
- **Benefits**: The graph's structure can yield valuable insights. For instance, it can <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">highlight document similarities without focusing on the document's actual content</mark>.
    

#### Bibliographic Coupling

- **Definition**: Introduced by Kessler in 1963, bibliographic coupling <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">measures the similarity of documents</mark>. The coupling between two documents, A and B, is defined by the <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">number of shared citations, or the intersection of their bibliographies</mark>.

#### Web Links vs. Citations

- **Differences**: Web links serve varied purposes, from navigation to endorsements. Unlike academic citations, not all web links signify endorsements.
    
- **Characteristics of Web Links**:
    
    - Many are <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">navigational</mark> in nature.
    - Pages with a high in-degree are often portals rather than content-rich sources.
    - Not every link acts as an endorsement.
    - Corporate sites rarely link to competitors.
    - Academic citations, by contrast, are upheld by peer-review, emphasizing references to pertinent literature.

### Authorities & Hubs

- **Authorities**: These are web pages acknowledged for offering reliable, valuable, and pertinent information on a topic. While <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">in-degree (the number of links pointing to a page) can be a measure of authority</mark>, it's essential to remember that not all links hold the same weight. Do links from authoritative pages carry more importance?
    
- **Hubs**: Think of hubs as directories or index pages. They direct users to a plethora of relevant content pages, also known as authorities.

### PageRank

- **Overview**: Conceived by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, the founders of Google, PageRank revolutionized web search by assessing the importance of web pages based on the links pointing to them.
    
- **Functionality**:
    
    - The basic idea behind PageRank is that not all links are equal. A link from a reputable site carries more weight than one from a less-known site.
    - PageRank operates on the principle that valuable or authoritative websites are likely to be linked from other authoritative websites.
- **Implementation**: It uses a probabilistic model and iteratively evaluates the rank of a page based on inbound links. A page's PageRank is calculated by taking a fraction of the ranks of all the pages that link to it.
    
- **Impact**: PageRank was one of the first algorithms used by Google Search to rank web pages in search engine results. Although it's just one of many factors Google uses now, it laid the foundation for modern search algorithms.


$$PR(P) = (1-d) + d \times \sum_{Q \in \text{InboundLinks}(P)} \frac{PR(Q)}{L(Q)}$$ 
Given that Î± = 0 (d = 1), the formula further simplifies to:
$$PR(P) = \sum_{Q \in \text{InboundLinks}(P)} \frac{PR(Q)}{L(Q)}$$
