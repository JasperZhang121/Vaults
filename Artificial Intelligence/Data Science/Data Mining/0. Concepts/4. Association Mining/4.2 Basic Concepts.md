### Preliminary Definitions

- Item: an <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">atomic piece of nominal data</mark>, e.g. apple, orange, or banana.
- Itemset: <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">A set of one or more items</mark>, denoted by ${\cal I} = \{I_1, I_2,..I_m\}$, e.g. ${\cal I}=\{apple, orange, banana\}$.
- k-itemset: <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">An itemset of cardinality k</mark>, where k is a positive integer. Denoted by $X = \{x_{1},...,x_{k}\}$, e.g. $\{apple, orange\}$ is a 2-itemset.
- Transaction: A non-empty itemset with a unique identifier in a group called a database. Denoted by $T\in D$, where $D$ is a set of task-relevant transactions (or a dataset or a database), e.g. $D = \{T_1, T_2\}$, $T_1=\{apple, orange\}$, $T_2=\{apple, banana, orange\}$. 

While <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">each transaction</mark>, $T$, has a <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">unique identifier</mark>, say $TID$, this is not always explicit in the transaction but is needed to ensure that multiple transactions containing the same items are distinguished when required. Alternatively, a database could be a bag of transactions, but more usually it is assumed to be a set, with multiple transactions containing the same itemset assumed to be distinguished via a $TID$.

- Support Count: <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">The number of transactions that contain an itemset</mark>, denoted by $$|T, \text{such that } A\subseteq T \text{ and } T\in D|$$. Also called <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">occurrence frequency, frequency, absolute support, and count</mark>, e.g. the support count of $\{apple\}$ is 2 in dataset $$D=\{\{apple\}, \{apple, orange\}, \{banana, orange\}\}$$.
- Support: <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">The proportion of transactions that contain an itemset</mark>, denoted by $$\text{support}(A) = \frac{\text{support count of }A \text{ in } D}{\text{cardinality of }D}$$. Also called relative support and sometimes frequency, e.g. the support of $\{apple\}$ in dataset $D$ above is $2/3$.
- Frequent Itemset: An itemset with support greater than or equal to a minimum support threshold, denoted by $\text{support}(A)\geq \text{min\_sup}$, where $\text{min\_sup}$ is a user-defined, application-specific parameter.
- Association Rule: <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">An implication of the form</mark> $A \Longrightarrow B$, where $A\subset {\cal I}$, $B\subset {\cal I}$, $A\neq \emptyset$, $B\neq \emptyset$, and $A\cap B = \emptyset$.
- Rule Support: The proportion of transactions that contain every one of both $A$'s and $B$'s items. Denoted by $P(A\cup B)$, it measures the significance of the association rule in the dataset. Example: If $A={milk, bread}$ and $B={cheese}$, then the rule support for the association rule $A\Longrightarrow B$ is the proportion of transactions that contain all three items: $P(A\cup B)$.
- Confidence: The conditional probability of $B$ given $A$, denoted by $P(B\vert A)$. Also called the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">support ratio</mark>, it is the support count of $A\cup B$ in $D$ as a proportion of the support count of $A$ in $D$. Example: If $A={milk, bread}$ and $B={cheese}$, then the confidence for the association rule $A\Longrightarrow B$ is the proportion of transactions that contain both $A$ and $B$, out of the transactions that contain $A$: $P(B\vert A)$.
- Strong Rule: An association rule $A \Longrightarrow B$ is strong when $A\cup B$ is frequent. Example: If the minimum support threshold is 0.5 and the minimum confidence threshold is 0.8, then the association rule $A\Longrightarrow B$ is considered strong if $A\cup B$ has a support of at least 0.5 and the confidence of the rule is at least 0.8.
