The concept of closed frequent itemsets and maximal frequent itemsets are used to efficiently mine frequent itemsets from large datasets without losing important information.

An itemset X is considered <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">closed</mark> in the dataset D if there is <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">no</mark> other itemset Y in D that is a <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">superset</mark> of X and has the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">same support count</mark> as X. This means that X is as big as it can be without reducing the support count. A closed frequent itemset is an itemset that is both closed and frequent, meaning it occurs in the dataset with a frequency that is at least the minimum support threshold.

On the other hand, a <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">maximal frequent itemset</mark> is an itemset that is frequent in the dataset and has <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">no superset that is also frequent</mark>. In other words, it is as large as possible while still satisfying the minimum support threshold.

The closed frequent itemsets with their support counts represent all the frequent itemsets in the dataset, including those that are not closed. However, the maximal frequent itemsets represent all the frequent itemsets but may not give the exact counts for all of them.

By mining <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">closed and maximal frequent itemsets</mark>, we can efficiently <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">discover all frequent itemsets in a large dataset without generating redundant or unnecessary itemsets</mark>. This can significantly reduce the <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">computational cost</mark> of frequent itemset mining while preserving the important information about the frequency of itemsets in the dataset.
