 ### 1.

[Association mining] is classically suited to [nominal] attributes where attribute values are interpreted as items associated in a set called a  [transaction].  A set of these, in turn,  make up a database (or dataset) for mining.

[numeric or continuous]  attributes can be converted to [nominal] by grouping small ranges of values into categories, sometimes called "bins".

[ordinal] attributes, including [binary]  attributes, are  treated as [nominal] attributes, meaning the information of the order is not used, although an alternative for [ordinal]  attributes with a large range of possible values could be to bin into ranged categories as for [numeric or continuous] attributes.

### 2.

> What is the definition of **support** of an itemset?

$support(A, D) = \frac{| {T : A \subseteq T, T \in D } |}{|D|}$

### 3.

>  Consider the dataset, D, of transactions as follows.

| TID | Health and lifestyle              |
|-----|----------------------------------|
| 1   | {diabetes, drinking, overweight} |
| 2   | {diabetes, smoking, cerebrovascular}|
| 3   | {drinking, overweight, liver} |
| 4   | {drinking, overweight} |
| 5   | {diabetes, overweight, exercise} |
| 6   | {diabetes, drinking, overweight, exercise} |

What is the confidence for the rule {drinking} → {overweight}?

$confidence(A \rightarrow B) = \frac{support(A \cup B)}{support(A)}$

```
confidence(A ⟹ B) = support(A U B) / support(A)

confidence({drinking} ⟹ {overweight}) = support({drinking, overweight}) / support({drinking}) = (4/6)/(4/6)=1

```


### 4.
> Considering the dataset D given above, with minimum support  = 50%  and minimum confidence = 100%, which association rules are **strong**? In your answer write each strong rule on one line, separated by a single space. Use no other white space, and use "=>" for the implication sign. For example, write as follows (you can copy this as a syntax template if you like) {liver}=>{smoking,drinking} {liver,exercise}=>{overweight}

```

min_sup_count = 6*50% = 3
min_conf = 100%

use Apriori algorithm

1st ieration:
{drinking}            4
{diabetes}            4
{overweight}          5
{smoking}             1       fail
{cerebrovascular}     1       fail
{liver}               1       fail
{exercise}            2       fail


2nd iteration:
{drinking,diabetes}        2        fail
{drinking,overweight}      4     
{diabetes,overweight}      3

3rd iteration:
{drinkging,overweight,diabetes} 2    fail

return:
		{drinking,overweight}      4     
		{diabetes,overweight}      3

confidence:

sup(drinkging,overweight)/sup(drinking) = 1      ==   100% confidence
sup(diabetes,overweight)/sup(diabetes) = 3/4

sup(drinkging,overweight)/sup(overweight) = 4/5
sup(diabetes,overweight)/sup(overweight) = 3/5

As result: dirnking=>overweight

```


### 5.
> Considering the dataset D given above, what is the **lift** of  rule {drinking} => {liver} ?


$lift(A,B) = \frac{support(A \cup B)}{support(A) \times support(B)}$

```
lift(drinking, liver) = sup(drinking or liver)/(sup(drinking) * sup(liver)) = (1/6)/( (4/6) * (1/6)) = 6/4
```


### 6.
>Chi-square

```
Given an association rule, chi-square can be used to determine whether the left-hand side items are either significantly more or significantly less likely to occur together in a transaction with the right hand side items than would be expected by chance.

If the chi-square statistic is greater than 1, then for practical purposes it indicates that a rule could be interesting
```

### 7.
> The property called **null-invariance** is particularly important when evaluating  patterns involving low-frequency itemsets.  

Basically it is asking wheter adding extra transactions that do not contain either antecedent or consequence. 

```
A null-invariant measure is affected only by transactions in which the  measured  itemsets occur, and not by transactions in which they do not occur.

Because chi-square and lift are not null-invariant, the correlation amongst the pair of itemsets being measured is increased by transactions in the database in which neither itemset occurs. (increase transactions will change the chi-square)

Lift is not null-invariant. (because of one sup denominator)

Confidence is null-invariant. (no sup denominator in this formula after cancel each other)

```

### 8.
> Consider the database D of 3 transactions, where each postive integer _i_ is an item:

T1 :{1 ,2,.3, ..10 }

T2: {1,2,3,...20}

T3: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

Assume min_sup, the minimum support, is 2/3

Which of the following statements are true?

```  
T3 is a closed itemset
T3 is a closed frequent itemset
T1 is a maximal frequent itemset
The itemset T1 is frequent
2^10-1 non-empty subsets of T1 (including T1 itself) are frequent
```

**Explain:**

Definition: 
- frequent: an itemset that occurs in a dataset with a particular frequency.
- closed: An itemset is closed **if none of its immediate supersets has the same support as the itemset** .
- maximal frequent: **if none of its immediate supersets is frequent**


```
frequent: 
T1: 2/3
T3: 3/3
		T2: 1/3        fail     

closed:
T1
T2
T3
		{1,2,3} is not closed as T2 is the superset and has the same support

maximal frequent:
T1
		T3 fail as T1 is superset and frequent
		T2 is not even frquent
```
