### Definition of Cluster in DBSCAN
#### A subset C $\subseteq$ D is a cluster if
- All points within the cluster C are mutually density-connected, and
- There is no point outside C that is density-connected to a point inside C.

Example of density-reachable and density-connected:

> Let \epsilon be the radius of the circles and MinPts 3.  

> m,p,o, r are <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">core objects</mark>. 

> Object q is directly density-reachable from m.

> Object m is directly density-reachable from p and vice versa.  

> Object q is density-reachable from p because q is directly density reachable from m and m is directly density-reachable from p. However, p  is not density reachable from q because q is not a core object.

> r and s are density-reachable from o

> o is density-reachable from r.

> o, r, and s are all density-connected.
