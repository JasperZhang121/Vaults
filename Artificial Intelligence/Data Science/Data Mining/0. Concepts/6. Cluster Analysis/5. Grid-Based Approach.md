### Grid-based clustering

- Space driven approach by <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">partitioning the input space into cells</mark>.

- Multiresolution grid data structure approach is used: <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">quantize the object space into a finite number of cells</mark> that forms a grid structure.

- Fast processing time which is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">independent of the number of data objects</mark>.

Possible clusters are predefined by the design of the grid and therefore the defined allocation of objects to grid cells; the problem becomes to retrieve the clusters that statisfy a query that includes statistical properties of desirable clusters.


### STING: STatistical INformation Grid

In STING, the input space is divided in a hierarchical way

- At the first layer, the input space is divided into some rectangular cells.
- Each cell at a high level is partitioned to form a number of cells at the next level.

-> Hierarchical structure for STING clustering.

- Precomputed statistical parameters:
	- Statistical informations such as count, mean, maximum, and minimum, of each grid cell is precomputed and stored.
	- Statistics of the bottom level cells are directly computed from the data.
	- Statistics of a higher level cell can be computed based on lower-level cells
- Answer spatial data queries using precomputed statistics
	- Top down approach: 
	- Start from a pre-selected layer - typically with a small number of cells
	- Compute the confidence interval reflecting the cellâ€™s relevance to the given query
		- Irrelevant cells are removed
		- Children of remaining cells will be examined
		- Repeat until the bottom layer is reached
- The regions of relevant cells, which satisfy the query, are returned
- Query example:
	- Select the maximal regions that have at least 100 houses per unit area and at least 70% of the house prices are above $400K and with total area at least 100 units with 90% confidence

Advantage
- Grid-based computation is <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">query-independent</mark>
- Grid structure facilitates <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">parallel processing and incremental updating</mark>
- Computational efficiency: STING goes through the database once to compute the statistical parameters of the cells

Disadvantage
- Sensitive to bottom level granularity
	- If the <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">granularity is very fine, the cost of processing will increase substantially</mark> 
	- if the bottom level of the grid structure is too coarse, it may reduce the quality of cluster analysis
- All the cluster boundaries are either horizontal or vertical, and no diagonal boundary is detected
