### Lazy vs. Eager Learning

-   Lazy learning (e.g., instance-based learning): Simply stores training data (or only minor processing) and waits until it is given a test tuple
-   Eager learning (the discussed methods so far): Given a set of training tuples, <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">constructs a classification model before receiving new (e.g., test) data to classify</mark>
-   Lazy: less time in training but more time in predicting
-   Eager: must commit to a single hypothesis that covers the entire instance space

Accuracy
-   Lazy method effectively uses a richer hypothesis space since it uses many local linear functions to form an implicit global approximation to the target function
-   Eager: must commit to a single hypothesis that covers the entire instance space

**Lazy Learner: Instance based method**
-   Instance-based learning
    -   Store training examples and delay the processing (“lazy evaluation”) until a new instance must be classified
-   Typical approaches
    -   k-nearest neighbor approach (KNN)
        -   Instances represented as points in a Euclidean space.
    -   Locally weighted regression
        -   Constructs local approximation
    -   Case-based reasoning
        -   Uses symbolic representations and knowledge-based inference
