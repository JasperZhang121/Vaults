#### Data Mining for Generalisation
-   Data warehousing
    -   multidimensional data model
    -   Data cube technology
    -   OLAP (online analytical processing)
-   Multidimensional class or concept description: Characterization and discrimination
-   Generalize, summarize, and contrast data characteristics, e.g., dry vs. wet region
-   Data characterised by a user specified class description can be retrieved from a warehouse
-   Data discrimination can compare features of selected classes
-   OLAP operations can be used to summarise data along user-specified dimensions

#### Frequent Patterns, Association and Correlation Analysis

-   <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Frequent patterns (or frequent itemsets)</mark>
    -   What prescribed drugs are frequently taken together? What welfare payments are frequently received together?
-   Association, correlation vs. causality
    -   A typical association rule: Tertiary Education -> Atheist  [10%, 20%]  (support, confidence)
    -   Are strongly associated items also strongly correlated?
-   How to mine such patterns and rules efficiently in large datasets?
-   How to use such patterns for classification, clustering, and other applications?

#### Classification and Regression for Prediction  

-   <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Classification</mark>  
    -   Construct models (functions) based on some training examples (**supervised** learning)
    -   Describe and distinguish classes or concepts for future prediction
    -   Predict unknown discrete class labels
    -   e.g., classify countries based on climate, or classify cars based on fuel efficiency  
  
-   <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Regression</mark> (also called _numerical prediction_)

-   Construct models based on some training examples (supervised learning)
-   Predict unknown continuous values
-   e.g. predict weight from height and age, or predict precipitation based on geo-location and cloud patterns.  
    

-   Typical methods - <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Decision trees, naïve Bayesian classification, support vector machines, neural networks, rule-based classification, pattern-based classification, logistic regression</mark>, …
-   Typical applications - Credit card or taxation fraud detection, direct marketing, classifying stars, diseases,  web-pages, …

#### Clustering/ Cluster Analysis

-   **Unsupervised** learning (i.e., Class label is unknown)
-   Group data to form new categories (i.e., clusters), e.g., cluster houses to find distribution patterns, cluster youth in detention to develop  targeted interventions.
-   Principle: Maximizing intra-cluster similarity & minimizing inter-cluster similarity
-   Many methods and applications

#### Outlier Analysis

-   Outlier: A data object that does not comply with the general behavior of the data
-   Noise or exception? ― One person’s garbage could be another person’s treasure
-   Methods: by-product of clustering or regression analysis, …
-   Useful in fraud detection, rare events analysis, who is slipping through the safety net?

#### Others

-   Sequence, trend, and evolution analysis (for temporal  or other sequence data)
-   Structure, network and text analysis, e.g. Web mining
-   Inductive logic programming e.g. linked data or knowledge graph mining
