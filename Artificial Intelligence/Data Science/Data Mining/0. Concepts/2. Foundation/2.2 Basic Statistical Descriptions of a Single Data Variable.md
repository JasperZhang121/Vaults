In statistics, central tendency is a measure that represents the typical or central value of a dataset. The three most common measures of central tendency are the mean, median, and mode.

### Mean

The mean is the sum of all values in a dataset divided by the number of values. It represents the average value of the dataset.

Formula:

$$\bar{x}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i}{n}$$

where $\bar{x}$ is the mean, $x_i$ are the values in the dataset, and $n$ is the number of values.

The mean is sensitive to outliers, meaning that extreme values can skew the value towards one direction or the other.

### Median

The median is the middle value of a dataset when the values are arranged in order. If the dataset has an odd number of values, the median is the middle value. If the dataset has an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values.

Formula:

-   If n is odd:

$$Median = x_{\frac{n+1}{2}}$$

-   If n is even:

$$Median = \frac{x_{\frac{n}{2}} + x_{\frac{n}{2}+1}}{2}$$

where $x$ is the dataset.

The median is less sensitive to outliers than the mean, as it only takes into account the middle value(s) of the dataset.

### Mode

The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. It represents the most common value in the dataset.

Formula:

$$Mode = \text{value that appears most frequently in the dataset}$$

The mode can be useful when dealing with categorical or discrete data.

### Arithmetic Mean

The arithmetic mean is the same as the regular mean, but it takes into account the weights of the values in the dataset.


### Weighted Mean

The weighted mean is a variation of the arithmetic mean, where each value is multiplied by a weight that reflects its importance in the dataset.

Formula:

$$\bar{x} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n w_ix_i}{\sum_{i=1}^n w_i}$$

where $\bar{x}$ is the weighted mean, $x_i$ are the values in the dataset, $w_i$ are the weights of the values, and $n$ is the number of values.

The weighted mean can be useful when dealing with datasets where certain values are more important or have a greater impact than others.

##### Midrange
-   Defined as the average of the largest and smallest values
-   Cheap to compute as indication of central tendency of thedata  


##### Skewness
The figure illustrates the main central tendency measures of symmetric and skewed data.

Skewness is a measure of asymmetry in data. As seen here the sign and magnitude of the difference between mean and mode is an simple indicator of skewness in the data. There are many other ways to measure skewness.
