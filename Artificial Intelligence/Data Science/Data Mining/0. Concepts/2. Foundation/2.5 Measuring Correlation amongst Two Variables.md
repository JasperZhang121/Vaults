There are some measures commonly used to assess whether variables areÂ **correlated**, that is that one can (approximately) be computed directly from the other.


**Pearson's Correlation**

-   Measures how well a straight line can be fitted to two continuous attributes (one on each axis).
-   Also called Pearson's r, Pearson product-moment correlation, Pearson correlation coefficient, bivariate correlation
-   Ranges from -1 (perfectly negatively correlated), through 0 (no correlation) to 1 (perfectly positively correlated).

The formula for Pearson's Correlation is:

$$r = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})^2} \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \bar{y})^2}}$$

where:

-   n is the number of observations
-   $x_i$ and $y_i$ are the ith observations of X and Y, respectively
-   $\bar{x}$ and $\bar{y}$ are the means of X and Y, respectively

Here's an example code snippet in Python to calculate Pearson's Correlation:

```python
import numpy as np

# Sample data
X = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
Y = np.array([2, 4, 5, 7, 8])

# Calculate means
x_mean = np.mean(X)
y_mean = np.mean(Y)

# Calculate Pearson's Correlation
numerator = np.sum((X - x_mean) * (Y - y_mean))
denominator = np.sqrt(np.sum((X - x_mean)**2) * np.sum((Y - y_mean)**2))
r = numerator / denominator

print(f"Pearson's Correlation: {r}")
```

The formula for Spearman's rank correlation coefficient is:

$r_s = 1 - \frac{6\sum d_i^2}{n(n^2 - 1)}$

where $d_i$ is the difference between the ranks of the corresponding $x_i$ and $y_i$ values, and $n$ is the sample size.

The formula for Kendall's tau coefficient is:

$\tau = \frac{2}{n(n-1)} \sum_{i<j} sgn(x_i - x_j) sgn(y_i - y_j)$

where $sgn$ is the sign function, and $n$ is the sample size.
