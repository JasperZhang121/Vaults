Minkowski distance is a distance metric used to calculate the distance between two points in a multidimensional space. It is <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">a generalization of the Euclidean distance</mark> and can be defined for any value of "p", where "p" is a positive real number.

The Minkowski distance between two points `x and `y` in `n`-dimensional space is defined as:

$d_{M}(x,y) = (\sum_{i=1}^{n} {|x_{i} - y_{i}|}^p)^\frac{1}{p}$

where `p` is the degree of the distance.
