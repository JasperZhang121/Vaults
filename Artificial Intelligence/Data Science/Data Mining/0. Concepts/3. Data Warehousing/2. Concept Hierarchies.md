A **concept hierarchy** defines a sequence of mappings from a set of <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">low-level concepts to higher-level</mark>, more general concepts. They <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">support the modelling of data at varying levels of abstraction</mark>.  

### Examples:
-   Geography (top level)
    -   Country
        -   State/Province
            -   City
                -   Store location

At the top level, the data is aggregated by country, so you can see the total sales for each country where the retail business operates. As you move down the hierarchy, the data becomes more specific and granular, so you can see the total sales for each state/province within each country, then the total sales for each city within each state/province, and finally the total sales for each store location within each city.

Another example of a concept hierarchy could be for a sales organization:

-   Time (top level)
    -   Year
        -   Quarter
            -   Month
                -   Week
                    -   Day

At the top level, the data is aggregated by year, so you can see the total sales for each year. As you move down the hierarchy, the data becomes more specific and granular, so you can see the total sales for each quarter, then the total sales for each month within each quarter, and so on, down to the total sales for each day within each week.
