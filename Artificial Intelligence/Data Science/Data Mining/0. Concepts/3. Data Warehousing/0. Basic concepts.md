**What is a Data Warehouse?**

-   Defined in many different ways, but not rigorously.
-   <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">A decision support database</mark> that is maintained <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">separately from the organisation’s operational database</mark>
-   Supports information processing by providing a solid platform of consolidated, historical data for analysis.
-   A data warehouse is a subject-oriented, integrated, time-variant, and nonvolatile collection of data in support of management’s decision-making process.”—W. H. Inmon
-   _Data warehousing_ is the process of constructing and using data warehouses

**Typical Characteristics  of a Data Warehouse**

**Subject-Oriented**

-   Organised around <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">major subjects</mark>, such as customer, product, sales
-   Focusing on the <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">modelling and analysis of data</mark> for decision makers, <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">not on daily operations or transaction processing</mark>
-   Provides a simple and concise view around particular subject issues by excluding data that are not useful in the decision support process

**Integrated**

-   Constructed by integrating <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">multiple, heterogeneous</mark> data source e.g. relational databases, flat files, on-line transaction records
-   Data cleaning and data integration techniques are applied.
    -   Ensure consistency in naming conventions, encoding structures, attribute measures, etc. among different data sources
    -   e.g., Hotel price: currency, tax, breakfast covered, etc.
    -   When data is moved to the warehouse, it is converted (this process is called _ETL_, for <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Extract, Transform, Load</mark>)

**Time Variant**

-   The time horizon for the data warehouse is significantly <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">longer than that of operational systems</mark>
    -   <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Operational database: current value data</mark>
    -   Data warehouse data: provide information from a <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">historical perspective</mark> (e.g., past 5-10 years)
-   Every key structure in the data warehouse
    -   <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Contains an element of time, explicitly or implicitly</mark>
    -   But the key of operational data may or may not contain “time element”

**Nonvolatile**

-   A physically separate store of data transformed from the operational environment
-   <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Operational update of data does not occur in the data warehouse</mark> environment
    -   Does not require transaction processing, recovery, and concurrency control mechanisms
    -   Requires only two operations in data accessing: Initial loading of data and access of data

**Comparison with typical operational databases:**

Most databases are used for **online transaction processing (OLTP)** and querying for day-to-day operations. On the other hand, data warehouses are built specifically for analytics to support decision making, that is, **online analytical processing (OLAP).**

The key difference between OLTP and OLAP is that<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;"> OLTP is focused on capturing and processing transactions in real-time</mark>, while <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">OLAP is focused on analyzing and reporting on data over a longer period of time</mark>. As such, data warehouses are typically used to support strategic decision-making processes, while operational databases are used for day-to-day operations.

The formula for calculating the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">number of cells in an n-dimensional data cube</mark> with m levels for each dimension is:

C = (m+1)^n - 1

where:

-   C = total number of cells in the cube
-   n = number of dimensions in the cube
-   m = number of levels for each dimension

The "-1" is subtracted from the formula because it represents the apex cell, which is a single cell that contains all the measures aggregated. All other cells in the cube are aggregated over a subset of dimensions.
