Need:

-   Dimension tables, such as item (item_name, brand, type), or time (day, week, month, quarter, year)
-   A fact table that contains measures (such as dollars_sold) and keys to each of the related dimension tables

Star schema: A fact table in the middle connected to a set of dimension tables. The primary key for the fact table is composed of a key for each dimension and the remaining attributes are the measures.  

```
Fact Table:

-   Sales (measures)

Dimension Tables:

-   Product (attributes)
-   Time (attributes)
-   Geography (attributes)
```


Snowflake schema:  A refinement of star schema where some dimensional hierarchy is normalised into a set of smaller dimension tables, forming a shape similar to snowflake.

```
Fact Table:

-   Sales (measures)

Dimension Tables:

-   Product (attributes)
    -   Product Category (attributes)
    -   Product Subcategory (attributes)
-   Time (attributes)
    -   Year (attributes)
    -   Quarter (attributes)
    -   Month (attributes)
    -   Day (attributes)
-   Geography (attributes)
    -   Country (attributes)
    -   State/Province (attributes)
    -   City (attributes)
    -   Zip/Postal Code (attributes)
```


Fact constellation:  Multiple fact tables share dimension tables, viewed as a collection of stars, therefore called galaxy schema or fact constellation.

Snowflake and Constellation schemes are fairly obvious extensions of the basic Star schema to more complex data.
