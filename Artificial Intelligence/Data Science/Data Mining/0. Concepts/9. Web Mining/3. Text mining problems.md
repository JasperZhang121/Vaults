### Keyword based association analysis

#### **Motivation**  
• Collect sets of keywords or terms that occur frequently together and then find the association or correlation relationships among them

#### **Association analysis process**
- Pre-process the text data by <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">parsing, stemming, removing stop words, etc</mark>.
- Invoke association mining algorithms

• Consider each **document** as a **transaction**  
• View a set of words in the document as a set of items in the transaction

-   Term level association mining
    - Can extract compound associations as entities or domain concepts (e.g. "New South Wales", or "big data").
    - Can replace human effort for tagging documents in databases.
    - The number of meaningless results and the execution time is greatly reduced over word-based search or mining

### Text Classification

**Motivation**  
• Automatic classification for the large number of on-line text documents  
(Web pages, e-mails, corporate intranet documents, etc.)

**Classification process**
• Data pre-processing  
• Definition of training set and test sets  
• Creation of the classification model using the selected classification algorithm  
• Classification model validation  
• Classification of new/unknown text documents  

**Text document classification differs from the classification** **of relational data**; Document databases are not structured according to attribute-value pairs

#### **Class labels (categories) may be developed by hand**
-   Pre-given classes (categories) and labeled documents (examples)
-   Categories may form hierarchy/taxonomy
-   Classify new documents
-   A standard classification (supervised learning) problem

#### **Classification algorithms that are used:**
-   Support vector machines
-   K-nearest neighbors
-   Naïve Bayes
-   Neural networks
-   Decision trees
-   Association rule-based
-   Boosting
-   more..

#### Document Clustering

##### **Motivation**  
• Automatically group related documents based on their contents  
• No predetermined training sets or taxonomies  
• Generate a taxonomy at runtime

##### **Clustering process**

• Data **preprocessing:** <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">remove stop words, stem, feature extraction, lexical analysis, etc.</mark>

• Document vectors are very high-dimensional -- need to **project to a lower-dimensional** space using spectral clustering, mixture model clustering, Latent Semantic Indexing or Locality Preserving Indexing.

• **Hierarchical clustering**: <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">compute similarities</mark> applying clustering algorithms

or  
• **Model-based clustering** (neural network approach): clusters are represented by “exemplars” (for example Self-Organising Maps, SOM)
