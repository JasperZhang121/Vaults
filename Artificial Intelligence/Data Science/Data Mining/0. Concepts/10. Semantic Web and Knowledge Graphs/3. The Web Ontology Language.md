The Web Ontology Language (OWL) is a modellng language (like _UML_)  that is _logical,_ not specifically diagrammatic, and is expressed as logical axioms over which deductive _inference_ is supported.

- It is a very <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">expressive data modelling language</mark> with a formal semantics (c.f. UML).

- Is fundamentally a <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">logical language</mark>: a _Description Logic_: a decidable fragment of First-Order Predicate Calculus with only unary and binary predicates permitted.  

- Is best used with a _reasoner_ for logical inference.

	- There are many OWL docs out there which do not say what they claim to say and which do not respect the semantics because someone just looked at the syntax and went from there

	- Especially happens  with property owl:sameAs, used widely for linked data over distributed Web endpoints  

- OWL 2 standardised October 2009 (supersedes OWL 2004). Minor update December 2012 (for XML types).

- Spec: [http://www.w3.org/standards/techs/owl#w3c_all](http://www.w3.org/standards/techs/owl)

- Comes with several syntaxes: _RDF/XML_ is normative; _Functional-Style_ syntax is used in the specs; OWL/XML is an XML encoding of that; _Manchester Syntax_ is readable (e.g.  in Protégé ontology editor), _Turtle_ is popular

- Is meant to be built on top of RDFS, but they are not quite comfortable co-habitating. Advise to avoid OWL2 Full = OWL2 DL + RDF(S). Instead use OWL 2 DL or a sublanguage (OWL EL, OWL QL, OWL RL): think of it as a new language that reuses some RDF(S)  vocabulary

### OWL preliminaries

- _Open World Assumption_ means

	-   Can assert negative things, but cannot infer it from the absence of the positive thing (beware, database modellers!)
	-   No _unique names assumption_: i.e cannot infer that two things are not the same because they have different names (URIs)

- OWL is strongly typed

	-   Disjoint domains of _individuals_, _classes_, _object properties_, _datatype properties_, _datatypes_,  _annotation properties_.
	-   Where the same name is used for different ones, they are different things (_punning_).

- OWL modelling is about defining statements about the relationships between and amongst various classes, properties and individuals.

There are two predefined classes in OWL: 
- "owl:Thing" and "owl:Nothing". 
- "owl:Thing" represents the most general class and serves as the root of the class hierarchy, while 
- "owl:Nothing" represents the empty class with no instances.

There are two predefined object properties in OWL: 
- "owl:topObjectProperty" and "owl:bottomObjectProperty".
- "owl:topObjectProperty" represents the most general object property and 
- "owl:bottomObjectProperty" represents the empty object property.

Two predefined data properties in OWL: 
- "owl:topDataProperty" and "owl:bottomDataProperty".
- "owl:topDataProperty" represents the most general data property and
- "owl:bottomDataProperty" represents the empty data property.

### OWL Classes

-   Classes in OWL represent <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">concepts or categories</mark> of individuals or objects.
-   Classes can have subclasses and can be <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">organized in a hierarchical structure</mark>.
-   Classes can have properties and restrictions associated with them.
-   Classes can be used to define relationships and constraints within an ontology.

```less
@prefix : <http://example.org/animal#> .
@prefix owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#> .

# Define classes
:Animal rdf:type owl:Class .
:Mammal rdf:type owl:Class ;
    rdfs:subClassOf :Animal .
:Bird rdf:type owl:Class ;
    rdfs:subClassOf :Animal .

# Define individuals
:Tiger rdf:type :Mammal .
:Eagle rdf:type :Bird .
```

- define three classes: "Animal", "Mammal", and "Bird" using the OWL vocabulary.
- The class "Mammal" is declared as a subclass of "Animal" using the "rdfs:subClassOf" property.
- The class "Bird" is also declared as a subclass of "Animal".
- define two individuals: "Tiger" and "Eagle" and specify their membership in the respective classes using the "rdf:type" property.

### Relating Classes and Properties

OWL properties can also be arranged in a <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">taxonomic hierarchy</mark> using the primitive "rdfs:SubPropertyOf". They can be assigned characteristics that constrain the interpretation of the properties and enable inference.

Properties can be related to classes through property restrictions, allowing for expressive descriptions of relationships between classes. These property restrictions can also impose cardinality constraints on a class.

```less
@prefix : <http://example.org/ontology#> .
@prefix owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#> .
@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .

# Define classes
:Train rdf:type owl:Class .
:Car rdf:type owl:Class .

# Define properties
:hasCar rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty ;
        rdfs:domain :Train ;
        rdfs:range :Car .
```

### Individuals

Individuals are the specific objects or instances described by the ontology. They are the members of classes and can have relationships with other individuals.

```python
Individuals:
- east1: Instance of class East and class Train
- car_11, car_12, car_13, car_14: Individual instances related to east1 through the hasCar property
```

```python
@prefix : <http://example.org/ontology#> .
@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .
@prefix owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#> .

:East rdf:type owl:Class .
:Train rdf:type owl:Class .
:hasCar rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty .
:Load rdf:type owl:Class .
:Shape rdf:type owl:Class .
:circle rdf:type owl:NamedIndividual .
:hexagon rdf:type owl:NamedIndividual .
:rectangle rdf:type owl:NamedIndividual .
:triangle rdf:type owl:NamedIndividual .

:east1 rdf:type owl:NamedIndividual, :East, :Train ;
       :hasCar :car_11, :car_12, :car_13, :car_14 .

:Load rdfs:subClassOf :Shape ;
      owl:equivalentClass [ rdf:type owl:Class ;
                            owl:oneOf ( :circle :hexagon :rectangle :triangle ) ] .
```

-   The individual "east1" is an instance of both the classes "East" and "Train".
-   The individual "east1" has a relationship "hasCar" with other individuals: "car_11", "car_12", "car_13", and "car_14".
-   The class "Load" is defined as a subclass of "Shape" and has exactly <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">four named individuals</mark>: "circle", "hexagon", "rectangle", and "triangle".

### Knowledge Graphs

A knowledge graph is a graph of RDF triples.  Commonly inference is very simple and OWL is not involved. However,  entities in nodes are often typed as datatypes (e.g. integer,  string ) or classes (e.g. city, place, human).

### Wikidata
1. Structured Data: Wikidata stores information in a structured form using a<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;"> triple-based data model similar to RDF</mark> (Resource Description Framework). It represents knowledge as statements in the form of subject-predicate-object triples.
    
2. Multilingual: Wikidata supports multilingual data, allowing information to be stored in multiple languages. This enables the sharing and exchange of knowledge across different language versions of Wikimedia projects.
    
3. Collaborative Editing: Like other Wikimedia projects, Wikidata is open to contributions from a global community of volunteers. Users can add, edit, and maintain data items, statements, and properties, ensuring that the knowledge graph is continuously updated and improved.
    
4. Linked Data: Wikidata follows linked data principles, which means it aims to establish <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">connections and links between entities and concepts across different datasets and knowledge graphs</mark>. This facilitates data integration and interoperability on the web.
    
5. Centralized Knowledge Repository: Wikidata serves as a central repository of structured data that can be used by various Wikimedia projects, including Wikipedia, Wikisource, and Wikivoyage. It provides a shared and consistent data source for information across these projects.
    
6. Entity and Property Framework: Wikidata organizes knowledge into entities, which represent real-world objects, concepts, or abstract entities, and properties, which define the attributes, relationships, and characteristics of these entities.
    
7. Open Access: Wikidata content is freely available and accessible under the Creative Commons CC0 license, allowing for widespread use and reuse of the data.
