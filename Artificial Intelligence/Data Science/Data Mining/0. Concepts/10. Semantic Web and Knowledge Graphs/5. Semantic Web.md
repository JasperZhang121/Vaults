Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the Web and 2016 Turing Award winner,  has said that he always wanted the Web to be something beyond human-readable documents.  In his 2009 TED talk _[The Next Web],_ he asks people to put `data` on the Web.  

He describes _linked data_ as using http names no longer just for documents but also for `real world things`  The technical name for these _http names_ to which he refers is (abbreviated) `URI`.  When you resolve one of those http names you get  `important information back`.   

He emphasises the power of explicit _relationships_ allowing computational follow-the-links, like in old-fashioned hypertext. In the semantic web standards stack, relationships are modelled by `predicates`.

> What is the _open world_ assumption?

```
That you cannot infer the negative of some statement from the absence of the positive form.
