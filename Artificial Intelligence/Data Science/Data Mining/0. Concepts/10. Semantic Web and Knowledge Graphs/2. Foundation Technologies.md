c
The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), is the governing standards body for the Web, including the Semantic Web. The Semantic Web  is often depicted graphically as a "Layer Cake".

![[SWlayer.gif]]

Here, we address the lower parts of the cake, i.e.<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> **URIs, RDF, RDFS, SPARQL and OWL**</mark>. "Rules" are now well-developed in the semantic web standards stack;  but the notions of  "Crypto", "Unifying Logic" , "Proof" and "Trust" remain active research in Semantic Web as well as the broader research community and Web standards development.

#### Universal Resource Identifiers (URIs)

URIs are the <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">identifiers</mark> of the Semantic Web.  They leverage the well-developed URLs of the Web, but also permit URNs that are not URLs.  

Technically, we should be speaking of "IRIs" that use an internationalised chacter set, but the term "URI" is popularly used.

**Tim Berners-Lee’s  “four rules”**:
1. Use URIs as names for things

2. Use HTTP URIs so that people can look up those names

3. When someone looks up a URI, provide useful information, using the standards (RDF*, SPARQL)

4. Include links to other URIs so that they can discover more things.


#### URI structure

- "Things” in the semantic web, even very abstract ones, are uniquely named by URIs.
- A URI is an identifier, <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">not necessarily a locator</mark> as is a URL.
- IRIs (International Resource Identifiers) allow extended characters and can be used in place of URIs.

### URI syntax:

`  <scheme> : <path> [? <query>] [# <fragment>]`


### Example:

-    ANU website: http://www.anu.edu.au/. This is a URL but is reused as a URI referring to the thing that is the ANU website.  
    
-   The actual ANU itself:  http://anu.edu.au/resource#id. This is a URI that refers to the thing that is the Australian National University. It also happens to be a URL.  
    
-   URIs include URNs (e.g., urn:oid:2.16.840  e.g. urn:doi:10.1109/MIS.2013.102)

### RDF/RDFs

**RDF** refers to the _Resource Description Framework_ (but it is always called by its acronym). It was originally developed for representation of _Metadata_ (i.e data about resources e.g.  in Dublin Core), and is widely used that way.  But it is now designed for representing data itself, i.e, as a  general data model. According to the standard, it <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">must be encoded in XML (as "RDF/XML")</mark>, but other serialisations  are much more popular, including "Turtle" and "JSON-LD" which is a JSON encoding.  

**RDFS** refers to the _Resource Description Framework Schema._  <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">RDFS is both a name-space and some formal modelling primitives and semantics that extend the descriptive power of RDF</mark>.  For simplicity of explanation, we do not present RDFS separately here, but instead wrap some of it into our presentation of RDF first and, later, some into our presentation of OWL.

### RDF for relations

- RDF uses <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">a flexible graph data model</mark> which doesn’t require much systematic design in advance, is easily extensible and seems to fit with the  foundational Web idea of decentralised creation and rich interconnections

- RDF graphs are defined  by nodes (usually labelled), which are connected by directed (one-way), labelled arcs.

### Example

This is a _triple_  that asserts a fact. The triple has three components, a node that is the _Subject,_ a directed <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">arc</mark> that is the _Predicate_, and a node that is the _Object_.  The _Predicate_ is also somewhat loosely called the _Property_ and more formally is a binary relation.

![[RDF_example.png]]

 In the serialisation syntax, _Turtle_, it is written as a statement terminated by a full stop, ".", as follows. URIs are enclosed by "<    >" angle brackets. The property is also a URI but is written in an abbreviated form (without angle brackets) here.

![[serialisation_turtle.png]]


### Encode Literals that are not things

Here, the name of the crcpress has a string value, “CRC Press”, that is not a URI, and is depicted in a rectangular box.  Unlike the subject and predicate in this graph, the object is a literal, not a URI.
![[CRC.png]]
In turtle, this is written as follows. Note the trailing "." that terminates the triple statement.  < http://crcpress.com/uri >  < http://example.org/name >  “CRC Press” .


### Namespace abbreviations

Reading and writing all those  long URIs is painful.  RDF re-uses the XML _namespace_ idea to abbreviate URIs.

- Without Abbreviations:
 
```ruby
<http://example.org/book/12345> <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://example.org/Book> ;
    <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label> "The Lord of the Rings" ;
    <http://example.org/author> <http://example.org/author/1234> ;
    <http://example.org/publisher> <http://example.org/publisher/1234> ;
    <http://example.org/publishedDate> "2001-01-01" ;
    <http://example.org/numberOfPages> "1000" .

<http://example.org/author/1234> <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://example.org/Author> ;
    <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label> "J.R.R. Tolkien" .

<http://example.org/publisher/1234> <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://example.org/Publisher> ;
    <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label> "HarperCollins" .
```

- With Namespace Abbreviations:

```less
@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .
@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .
@prefix ex: <http://example.org/> .

ex:book/12345 rdf:type ex:Book ;
    rdfs:label "The Lord of the Rings" ;
    ex:author ex:author/1234 ;
    ex:publisher ex:publisher/1234 ;
    ex:publishedDate "2001-01-01" ;
    ex:numberOfPages "1000" .

ex:author/1234 rdf:type ex:Author ;
    rdfs:label "J.R.R. Tolkien" .

ex:publisher/1234 rdf:type ex:Publisher ;
    rdfs:label "HarperCollins" .
```


### A graph: a set of Triples

Triples can share subject and /or object URIs in order to construct a graph.

#### Example

![[triples.png]]

**Turtle serialisation**, including the namespace declaration:  

```less
   @prefix ex: <http://example.org/> .

   <http://semantic-web-book.org/uri>

            ex:title "Foundations of Semantic Web Technologies"  ;  
            ex:publishedBy <http://crcpress.com/uri> .
              
    <http://crcpress.com/uri> ex:name "CRC Press" .
```

  
Notice the use of the semicolon (**;**) abreviation. Here it reuses the subject of an initial triple as the subject of a second triple. So we could have equivalently written this as 4 separate triple statements, each terminated by a full-stop as we saw before.

We do not have to name everything that is the subject or object of a triple. We can use a "_blank node_" that represents an unnamed node in the graph and  functions as a variable of very local scope, using the Turtle symbols "[" and "]".

#### Example

```less
  @prefix ex: <http://example.org/> .  
  <http://semantic-web-book.org/uri>  ex:publishedBy [ ex:name "CRCPress"]  ;  
           ex:title "Foundations of Semantic Web Technologies" .
```


### Typed Literals

Any URI can be used for a literal <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">datatype</mark>, but usually XML Schema (XSD) datatypes are re-used for typing literals.
![[URI_literals.png]]
**In Turtle:**
```less
http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-primer  
  ex:title "RDF Primer"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> ;  
  ex:publicationDate "2004-02-10"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#date> .
```

Usually we will also define a prefix for the XML Schema types, conventionally "xsd" so that when we are typing, say, a date as above we can write instead:   ``"2004-02-10"^^xsd:date`

### Type

RDF also has a very weak concept of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">object typing</mark>, built in.  The RDF property  "rdf:type" is used for this, and it can be abbreviated in Turtle to "a".

In Turtle syntax, which is a serialization format for RDF, the `rdf:type` property can be abbreviated as `a`. This is a shorthand notation that makes the Turtle syntax more concise. Instead of writing `rdf:type`, you can simply use `a` to indicate the type of a resource.

For example, instead of writing:

```ruby
<http://example.org/John> rdf:type <http://example.org/Person> .
```

```ruby
<http://example.org/John> a <http://example.org/Person> .
```


### SPARQL: Querying RDF

SPARQL is an acronym for _SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language_

- SPARQL 1.1. became a W3C recommendation in March 2013: [http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-overview](http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-overview/)[/](http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-overview/)

- The spec covers the query language, the REST protocol for interaction with a SPARQL endpoint, and the result format (XML, JSON, CSV, TSV).

- The query language is about <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">graph pattern matching with a syntax</mark> that resembles Turtle meets SQL.  

- Unlike SQL, you can <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">query for unknown relationships, as you do not need to specify the Subject, Predicate  and Object</mark>. You can use variables, in each position


#### Example

![[SPARQL.png]]

In this more typical SPARQL query, you can see  variables, the use of prefixes, more Turtle syntax, and regular expression filtering.
