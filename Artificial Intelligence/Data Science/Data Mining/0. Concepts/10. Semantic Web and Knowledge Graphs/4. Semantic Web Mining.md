Having put in place the basic principles, data models and standards of the semantic Web, now we turn to the question of mining all that Semantic Web data.

The approach is called _OWL-Miner._ It is a rule-learner that explores the space of (OWL) concept descriptions to <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">find one that best describes the training data</mark>.  It has access to an OWL ontology describing the application domain from which the training data is drawn, and it uses this to find very readable descriptions of potentially  complex relationships among things, for example, relationships amongst the structural components of an object.

OWL-miner can be used for a range of learning problems, but for this purpose we describe it as a _binary classification_ algorithm.

**The problem can be stated as follows:**  

Given a knowledge base comprising  

-   An OWL ontology  of axioms introducing the classes and relationships of the problem domain, including an identified target class
-   An hypothesis language $\cal L$ defined as a choice of class constuctors (such as union,  intersection, negation, cardinality, etc).      
-   RDF triples giving _positive_ example instances of the target class,  and _negative_ example instances that are not in the target class,
-   RDF triples that further describe the positive and negative examples by features expressed as class and property instances of the ontology;
-   A quality function to assess hypotheses (such as _accuracy_ or _f-measure_)  

Find an OWL class expression in $\cal L$ that describes the positive examples but does not describe the negative examples to optimally satisfy a bounded quality function (such as _accuracy > 95%_).  

OWL-miner  is a <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">top-down refinement-based learner</mark> that <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">searches for useful class descriptions by (in principle) enumerating</mark> _every_ possible expression and testing them for quality against the training data. It <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">starts with a very simple expression and gradually builds a tree of more complex expressions from there, checking them as it goes</mark>.
