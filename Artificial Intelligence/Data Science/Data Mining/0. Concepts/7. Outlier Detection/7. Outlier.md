> What is an outlier?

`A data point that significantly deviates from the other data points in a set, to the extent that it would have been generated by some abnormal  phenomenon`


> There are three kinds of outliers that require targeted techniques for search

There are three kinds of outliers that require targeted techniques to search for each. 

[Contextual] outliers can be transformed into a conventional approach by [partitioning some attributes for grouping first and using the others for prediction within the group]. This is used, for example, to find outlying people that do not conform to usual patterns of behaviour within their demographic group.

[Collective] outliers can be transformed into a conventional approach by [identifying structural units of related objects and mapping these to single objects represented by conventional features ]. This is used, for example, for [mining social networks that model relations between people in a graph]. 

For [Global] outliers the conventional approaches are used, including [building a oneâ€‘class classifier and identifying outliers outside the class ], [fitting a probability distribution and identifying points of low probability], [using the local outlier factor to detect objects that are even more distant than others in their local neighbourhood ] and [using the nested loop method for identifying outliers that are most distant from their nearest neighbours].

>Non-parametric statistical methods do not fit a statistical distribution to the data, but instead fit a user-controllable histogram or smoothing function and look for objects in regions with unusually low frequency.

Using the chi-square to compute the outlier-ness of a multidimensional object by aggregating the difference from the mean along each dimension at a time.

Computing a distance function along one dimension as an aggregate function of multidimensional distances using, for example, Mahalaobis distance.

> The nested loop algorithm for distance-based outlier detection computes, for as many of every pair of objects in the data it needs, the distance between each pair. The distance is compared to a threshold value and an object is considered an outlier if the proportion of other objects exceeding the threshold distance away is relatively small.

```
In "considered an outlier if the proportion of other objects exceeding the threshold distance " the word "exceeding" should be more like "inside" or "at a distance less than or equal to" 

'False'

>Outliers that are relatively distant from the clusters in which they occur 

Use k-means clustering and look for outliers unusually far from the cluster centroid, 

>Outliers that do not belong to any cluster

Use DBSCAN to build clusters and identify outliers, 


>Outliers belong to a small cluster and are unlike others in large nearby clusters, or else they are not very similar to the others in their own cluster

Use FindCBLOF
