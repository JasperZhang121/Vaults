Clustering-based approaches select outliers by examining the relationship between objects and clusters. An outlier is an object that belongs to a small and remote cluster, or belongs to no cluster.

### **Not belonging to any cluster**

Use a density-based clustering method such as DBSCAN and consider the unclustered points (noise) to be outliers.

### **Far from its closest cluster**

Use **k-means clustering** to partition data points into clusters.

Let $c_o$ be the closest cluster centre to object o. Let avdist$(c_o)$ be the average distance of all the objects in the cluster from $c_o$.
If $dist(o, c_o)/\it{avdist}(c_o)$ is large then o is considered an outlier
Alternatively for the case of unseen data o,
if $dist(o,c_o) > \max(dist(p_i, c_o))$ for all training data $p_i$ with closest cluster centre c_o, then o is considered an outlier.


### **Belonging to a small, distant cluster**

 **FindCBLOF** algorithm as follows:

- Find clusters, and sort them in decreasing size 
- To each data point, assign a **cluster-based local outlier factor** (CBLOF):
    - If obj _p_ belongs to a large cluster, CBLOF = cluster_size X similarity between _p_ and it's cluster
    - If _p_ belongs to a small cluster, CBLOF = cluster size X similarity between _p_ and the closest large cluster
- Data points with _low_ CBLOF are considered outliers

### **Strength of Clustering Based Approaches**

- Labelled data not required (unsupervised)
- Works for many data types
- Clusters may be useful data summaries
- Fast checking once clusters are built

### **Weaknesses** of Clustering Based Approaches

- Effectiveness dependent on clustering effectiveness
- Typically high computational cost for clustering
