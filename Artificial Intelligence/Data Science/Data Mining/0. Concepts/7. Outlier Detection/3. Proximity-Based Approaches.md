Based on the idea that objects that are far away from the others are outliers, proximity-based approaches assume the proximity of an outlier <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">deviates significantly</mark> from that of most of the others in the data set.

There are two types of proximity-based outlier detection methods:

- _Distance-based_ outlier detection: An object _o_ is an outlier if its neighbourhood does not have enough other points in it
- _Density-based_ outlier detection: An object _o_ is an outlier if  the density of objects around it is much lower than that of its neighbours

### Distance-Based Outlier Detection: Nested loop method

For a set D of data points, start with a user-defined parameter r called the **distance threshold** that defines a reasonable neighbourhood for each object. For each object o, examine the number of other objects in the r-neighbourhood of o.  <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">If enough of the objects in D are beyond the r-neighbourhood of o, then o should be considered an outlier</mark>. Be careful to exclude o itself when counting the objects in its near neighbourhood.

Formally, let $\pi (0<\pi<1)$ be a fraction threshold, a user-defined parameter that defines what proportion of objects in D are expected to be within the r-neighbourhood of every non-outlying object.

Then an object o is a distance-based outlier DB(r,\pi) if
$$\frac{ {\parallel \{ o' \mid {dist(o,o')}\leq r \} \parallel}} { \parallel D \parallel} < \pi$$
that is, if the proportion of objects in D that are as close as  r  is no more than $\pi$.

Equivalently, one can check the distance between o and its k-nearest neighbour ok, where  k is defined by compute k for nearest neighbour

In this case, o is an outlier if $\it{dist}(o, o_{k}) > r$

#### **Computation**

The simple nested-loop algorithm below, although theoretically $O(n^2)$, is usually linear in practice because the inner loop terminates early when there are few outliers.

For any object _oi_, calculate its distance from other objects, and count the number of other objects in the r-neighborhood.

If  _π∙n_ other objects are within _r_ distance, terminate the inner loop,  Otherwise, _oi_ is a _DB(r, π)_ outlier.

### Density-based Outlier Detection

Density-based outlier detection aims to detect **local outliers,** that is data points that are outliers compared to their local neighbourhoods, as well as **global outliers** that differ from the global data distribution.

For local outlier detection we want to capture the idea that the density of objects near an outlier is significantly lower than the density of objects near its neighbouring objects.

#### **Method**

Use the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">relative density of an object against its neighbours</mark> as the indicator of the degree of the object being outliers.
First we identify the distance  from each object  that defines a neighbourhood, by choosing a user-defined k and calculating the distance to the object's kth nearest neighbour.

Define k-distance of an object o,
$\it{dist}_{k}(o) = \it{dist}(o,p)$ where $p \in D$  is an object such that 

- There are at least k objects $o' \in D - \{o\}$  such that  $\it{dist}(o,o') \leq \it{dist}(o,p)$, and
- There are at most k-1  objects $o'' \in D - \{o\}$  such that $\it{dist}(o,o'') < \it{dist}(o,p)$.

That is, $\it{dist}_{k}(o)$  is the distance between o and its k-th nearest neighbour (which is p in the definition above).
$$N_{k}(o) = \{o'\mid o'\in D, \it{dist}(o, o') \leq \it{dist}_{k}(o)\}$$

While $N_{k}(o)$  is usually of size k, it could hold more than k objects since multiple objects may be same distance from o.
Now we have a set of objects that are in the neighbourhod of o, but we need to translate that to a notion of density around o. For this, we start with  asymmetric reachability distance amongst pairs of objects, from o to o':

$$reachdist(o' \leftarrow o)= \max({dist}_k(o'), dist(o',o))$$
#### Density
So the density function for an object becomes the **local reachability density,** defined as

$$lrd_k(o) = \frac{\parallel N_k(o) \parallel}{\sum_{o' \in N_k(o)}\it{reachdist}(o'\leftarrow o)}$$
See how this is the number of objects in the k-distance neighbourhood  of _o_ per unit of space. That space is  the sum of the reachability distances from _o_ to each of those objects. Let one of those objects be _o'_. The reachability distance here will often be  simply the distance from the object _o'_ to _o._ However, where it is higher, the k-distance neigbourhood of that other object _o'_ will be used instead of the simple distance between the two. Such an object _o'_ falls _inside_ the k-distance neighbourhood of _o_, but it has a bigger sparser neighbourhood itself. The effect of using the k-distance neigbourhood of _o'_ here, then, is to decrease the density otherwise attributed to _o_  to account for neighbour objects like _o'_ that are themselves more locally sparsely-packed.

#### **Local outlier factor**
Now we compare the density of an object o to the density of its neighbours. The local outlier factor $LOF_k(o)$ is defined as:

$$LOF_k(o) = \frac{\sum_{o' \in N_k(o)} \frac{lrd_k(o')}{lrd_k(o)}}{\parallel N_k(o) \parallel} = \frac{{\sum_{o' \in N_k(o)} {lrd_k(o')}}/{\parallel N_k(o) \parallel}} {{lrd_k(o)}}$$
That is, the local outlier factor is the ratio of the average local reachability density of the k-nearest neighbours of _o_ to the local reachability density of _o_ itself.

#### **Properties**

The lower the local reachability density of _o_, and the higher the local reachability density of the k-nearest neighbours of  _o_, then the higher  the LOF. This captures the idea that a **high LOF, well above 1,  indicates  a local outlier** whose local density is relatively low compared to the local densities of its  nearest neighbours. LOF is close to 1 for an object deep inside a consistent cluster, whether dense or sparse.
