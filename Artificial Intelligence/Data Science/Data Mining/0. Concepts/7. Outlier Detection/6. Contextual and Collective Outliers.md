### **Contextual Outliers**

An object is a **contextual outlier**  (or _conditional outlier)_ if it deviates significantly with <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">respect to a specific context of the object</mark>. The context is defined in the values of  identified **contextual attributes** of the object, such as location, time or demographic. The remaining attributes of the object are called **behavioural attributes.**

#### **Applications:**

- Detect a credit card holder with expenditure patterns matching millionaires in a context of low income
- Do not detect as an outlier a millionaire with high expenditure, given a context of high income
- Detect people with unusual spending or travelling patterns in a context of demographics and income for  target marketing
- Detect unusual weather  in a context of season and locality

#### **Method 1: Transform into Conventional Outlier Detection.**

-  Use the context attributes to <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">define groups</mark>
-  Detect outliers in the group based on the behavioural attributes alone, using a conventional outlier detection method

#### **Method 2: Model normal Behaviour wrt Contexts**

Used when it is not so easy to choose a the significant set of contextual attributes from the data you have.

- Using a training data set, <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">build a predictive model</mark> for the “normal” behaviour from all the context attributes
- An object is a contextual outlier if its behaviour attribute values significantly deviate from the values predicted by the model

### **Collective Outliers**

A group of data objects forms a **collective outlier** if the objects <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">as a whole deviate from the entire data set</mark>, even though each individual is not an outlier alone.  They are difficult to find because of the need to take into account the structure of the data set, ie relationships between multiple data objects.

Each of these structures is inherent to its respective type of data
- For temporal data (such as time series and sequences), we explore the structures formed by time, which occur in segments of the time series or subsequences
- For spatial data,  explore local areas
- For graph and network data, we explore subgraphs

Difference from contextual outlier detection: the structures are often not explicitly defined, and have to be discovered as part of the outlier detection process.
