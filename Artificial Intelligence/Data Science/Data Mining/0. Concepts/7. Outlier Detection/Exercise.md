> What is an outlier?

`A data point that significantly deviates from the other data points in a set, to the extent that it would have been generated by some abnormal  phenomenon`

There are three kinds of outliers that require targeted techniques to search for each. 

[Contextual] outliers can be transformed into a conventional approach by [partitioning some attributes for grouping first and using the others for prediction within the group]. This is used, for example, to find outlying people that do not conform to usual patterns of behaviour within their demographic group.

[Collective] outliers can be transformed into a conventional approach by [identifying structural units of related objects and mapping these to single objects represented by conventional features ]. This is used, for example, for [mining social networks that model relations between people in a graph]. 

For [Global] outliers the conventional approaches are used, including [building a oneâ€‘class classifier and identifying outliers outside the class ], [fitting a probability distribution and identifying points of low probability], [using the local outlier factor to detect objects that are even more distant than others in their local neighbourhood ] and [using the nested loop method for identifying outliers that are most distant from their nearest neighbours].

>Non-parametric statistical methods do not fit a statistical distribution to the data, but instead fit a user-controllable histogram or smoothing function and look for objects in regions with unusually low frequency.
