> What is an outlier?

`A data point that significantly deviates from the other data points in a set, to the extent that it would have been generated by some abnormal  phenomenon`


> There are three kinds of outliers that require targeted techniques for search

[Contextual] outliers can be transformed into a conventional approach by [partitioning some attributes for first and using the others for predication]. This is used, for example, to find outlying people that do not conform to usual patterns of behaviour with their demographic group.

[Collective] outliers can be transformed into a conventional approach by [Identifying structual units of related objects and mapping these to single objects]. This is used, for example, for [mining social networks that relationships betweeen people in a graph]. 

For [Global] outliers the conventional approaches are used, including [building a one-class classifier and identifying outliers the class], [fitting a probability distribution and identifying points of a low probability], [using the local outlier factor to detect objects that are even more distant than others] and [using the nested loop method for identifying outliers that are most distant from their nearest neighbours]
