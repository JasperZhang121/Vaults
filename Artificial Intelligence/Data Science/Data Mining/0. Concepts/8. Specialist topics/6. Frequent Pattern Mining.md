### Lossy Counting algorithm

- The Lossy Counting algorithm is a frequent pattern mining algorithm that <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">approximates the frequency of items or itemsets within a user-specified error bound</mark>. 
- It divides the incoming data stream into buckets of fixed width and maintains a data structure that stores the frequency of elements. 
- The algorithm prunes the data structure by deleting entries when a deletion rule is met.
- When a user requests a list of items with minimum support, the algorithm outputs entries in the data structure whose frequency is greater than or equal to the minimum support minus the error bound. 
- The algorithm is useful for mining frequent patterns in data streams where scanning the whole dataset multiple times is unrealistic.

Details: [[5. Lossy Counting Algorithm]]

```python
1: Set the margin of error to epsilon (0 < epsilon < 1)
2: Divide the incoming stream into buckets of width w = ceil(1/epsilon) transactions
3: Set N as the current stream length, b_c as the current bucket ID of the Nth item, and initialize f as the frequency of an element e
4: Create an empty data structure D to store triples of the form (e, f, delta), where delta is the maximum possible error in f
5: For each incoming element e:
     a. Check if an entry for e already exists in D
          i. If it exists, update the entry by incrementing its frequency f by one: (e, f, delta) -> (e, f+1, delta)
          ii. If it doesn't exist, create a new entry (e, 1, b_c-1)
     b. Prune D by deleting some entries when N mod w = 0
          i. An entry (e, f, delta) is deleted if f + delta <= b_c
6: When a user requests a list of items with minimum support sigma:
     a. Output all entries in D where f >= (sigma - epsilon)N
     b. If an item e is deleted based on the deletion rule in step 5b, its frequency f will start from 1 again when it appears in the stream later on
