  
Ensemble methods in machine learning combine multiple models to improve overall performance and accuracy. <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">The idea behind ensemble methods is to combine the predictions of several models instead of relying on a single model, as each model may have its own strengths and weaknesses.</mark> By combining the predictions of multiple models, ensemble methods can reduce the risk of overfitting and improve the generalization ability of the model.

There are two main types of ensemble methods: bagging and boosting. Bagging involves training multiple models independently on different subsets of the training data and averaging their predictions. Boosting, on the other hand, trains a series of weak models sequentially, with each subsequent model learning from the mistakes of its predecessors.

Ensemble methods have been successfully applied in a variety of machine learning tasks, such as classification, regression, and clustering. Some popular ensemble methods include Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and AdaBoost.
