Time series analysis involves modelling and forecasting a time series by decomposing it into four basic components, i.e., <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">trend, cyclic, seasonal, and irregular movements</mark>. The trend represents the general direction of a time series, while cyclic movements are long-term oscillations about the trend line. Seasonal movements are systematic movements that occur due to calendar-related events, and irregular movements are sporadic motions due to random or chance events.

<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Autocorrelation</mark> analysis can be used to identify seasonal patterns in the data. The correlation coefficient between two subsequences is computed for a given time lag. If a correlation is found, a seasonal index number is used to adjust the data for seasonal variation. The seasonal effect can be removed by dividing each value in the time series by its corresponding seasonal index value.

Moving average of order n can be used to detect trends in the data. The process of replacing the time series by its moving average value eliminates unwanted fluctuations, such as the 10-day moving average. Weighted moving average of order n reduces the effect of extreme values and irregular variations, using a vector of n weights chosen with greater values in the central elements. It can be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">centrally-weighted or lagged</mark>.
