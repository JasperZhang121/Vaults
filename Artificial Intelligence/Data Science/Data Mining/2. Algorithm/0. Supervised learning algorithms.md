-   **Linear regression**: Linear regression is a type of regression analysis used to predict a continuous output variable based on one or more input variables. The goal is to find the line of best fit that minimizes the sum of the squared differences between the predicted and actual values. [[1. Linear Regression]]
    
-   **Logistic regression**: Logistic regression is a type of regression analysis used to predict a binary output variable based on one or more input variables. The goal is to find the best decision boundary that separates the two classes. [[2. Logistic Regression]]
    
-   **Decision trees**: Decision trees are a type of algorithm that can be used for both regression and classification problems. They partition the data into subsets based on the values of input variables, and recursively split the subsets until the output variable is sufficiently well-defined.
    
-   **Random forests**: Random forests are an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve performance and reduce overfitting. They randomly sample the input variables and data points to create a collection of decision trees, and use them to make predictions by averaging their outputs.
    
-   **Support vector machines (SVM)**: SVMs are a type of algorithm that can be used for both regression and classification problems. They find the best hyperplane that separates the classes, and maximize the margin between the hyperplane and the closest data points. [[5. Support Vector Machine]]
    
-   **Neural networks**: Neural networks are a type of algorithm that are inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. They consist of layers of interconnected nodes that perform computations on the input data, and are commonly used for classification and regression problems.
