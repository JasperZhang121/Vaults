### 1. Simple Blocking

**Simple blocking** is the most straightforward method where records are grouped together based on the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">exact match of an attribute or a combination of attributes</mark>. 

For example:
- **Name-based blocking**: All records with the exact name "John Doe" are grouped together.
- **Birth year blocking**: All records with the birth year "1990" are grouped together.

This method is efficient but can <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">miss potential matches</mark> due to slight variations or errors in the blocking attribute.

### 2. Phonetic (Soundex) Based Blocking

This method is designed to <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">overcome variations in name spellings</mark> by grouping together names that sound alike. **Soundex** is one of the most popular phonetic algorithms.

- It converts a name into a character code. The first character is the first letter of the name, and the next three characters are numbers that represent the phonetics of the name.
- Names that have the same Soundex code are considered phonetically similar.
  
For example:
- Both "Smith" and "Smythe" might be represented by the same Soundex code.

Soundex blocking can be particularly useful for datasets with name variations due to misspellings, transcription errors, or different transliterations.

### 3. Statistical Linkage Key (SLK-581) Based Blocking

**SLK-581** is a specific method used primarily in health data linkage in Australia. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">It creates a linkage key based on specific attributes</mark>: 

- **Gender**: 1 character (male, female, or unknown).
- **Date of Birth**: 8 characters (day, month, year). If a part of the DOB is missing or invalid, it gets replaced with a wildcard character.
- **Given name and family name**: First 2 characters from each. If the name has fewer than 2 characters, it's supplemented with wildcard characters.

So, an SLK-581 key looks something like this: `M31011989JOEBSM`

- Where "M" represents male, "31011989" is the date of birth (31 Jan 1989), "JO" is the first two letters of the given name "Joe", and "BS" is the first two letters of the family name "Bishop".

Records with the same SLK-581 key are grouped together. This method has been designed to be privacy-preserving and efficient for health data, but like all blocking methods, there's a trade-off between reducing the number of comparisons and ensuring all potential matches are retained.

In summary:
- **Simple Blocking** relies on exact attribute matches.
- **Soundex** groups together names that sound similar.
- **SLK-581** is a specific, structured blocking method designed primarily for health data linkage.
