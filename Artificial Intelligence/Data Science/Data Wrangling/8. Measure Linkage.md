### Reduction ratio 

Measures by how much a blocking technique is able to reduce the comparison space 

Compared to the full pair-wise comparison of all record pairs rr = 1 â€“ (sM + sN) / (nM + nN) 

where: 
- sM and sN are the number of true matching and non-matching candidate record pairs generated by a blocking technique 
- nM and nN are the total number of true matching and non-matching record pairs (in the pair-wise comparison space)

### Pairs completeness
- Measures how many true matches 'pass' through a blocking process
- It corresponds to the recall of blocking $pc = sM / nM$ 
- It requires the true match status of all record pairs (as with the linkage quality measures)

### Pairs quality
- Measures how many candidate record pairs generated by blocking are true matches 
- It corresponds to the precision of blocking pq = sM / (sM + sN) 
- It requires the true match status of all record pairs (as with the linkage quality measures)
