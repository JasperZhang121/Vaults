### Internet 
Click-stream data, log files, Web pages (HTML, XML), blogs, e-mails, posts, multi-media data(images, videos, audio, etc.)
### Files
Portable text (like comma separated, tabulator, fixed column) or nonportable proprietary binary files 
### Scientific instruments, experiments and simulations

1. **Web Scraping:**
    
    - Web scraping is the process of <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">extracting data from websites</mark>. This can be done manually by a user or automatically by a program.
        
    - The primary tool for web scraping is the 'web scraper' which can be a dedicated web scraping software or a general-purpose programming language like Python or Java with libraries that can handle HTTP requests and parse HTML.
        
    - Steps in web scraping usually include: <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">sending a HTTP request to the URL of the webpage you want to access, receiving a response from the server, using a parser to parse the webpage, extracting the required data, and storing it in the desired format (like CSV, JSON, etc.)</mark>.
        
    - Web scraping is useful in a wide range of applications, including data mining, data analysis, and information processing. However, it should be done while respecting the <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">website's robots.txt file and the terms of service</mark>, to avoid any legal issues.
        
2. **Geocoding:**
    
    - Geocoding is the process of <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">converting addresses (like "1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA") into geographic coordinates (like latitude 37.423021 and longitude -122.083739)</mark>, which you can use to place markers on a map, or position the map.
        
    - Reverse geocoding is the process of converting geographic coordinates into a human-readable address.
        
    - Geocoding is performed by a geocoder, which is a piece of software or a service that implements a geocoding control process. Popular geocoding services include Google Geocoding API, Bing Maps API, and OpenStreetMap's Nominatim service.
        
    - Applications of geocoding include mapping, route planning, spatial analysis, and more. It's particularly valuable in fields like logistics, real estate, emergency services, and any other domain that relies heavily on geographic data.

Data quality dimensions
- Completeness – no missing data 
- Consistency – across different sources 
- Uniqueness – single view of dataset 
- Validity – meet constraints and rules 
- Accuracy – correct and reflect real data 
- Timeliness – no out-of-date values
