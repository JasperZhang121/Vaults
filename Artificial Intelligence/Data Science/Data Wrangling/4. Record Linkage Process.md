Record linkage is the process of finding and linking records about the <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">same entity</mark> across different data sources. It's crucial for integrating data sets, de-duplicating records, and creating a comprehensive view of entities. The process can be broken down into several steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
    
    - **Standardization:** Ensure that data from different sources adhere to common formats. For instance, date formats, addresses, and names should be consistent.
    - **Cleaning:** Rectify any inconsistencies or errors in the data. This includes correcting typographical errors, handling missing values, and so forth.
    - **Transformation:** Convert data into formats or structures that are amenable for linkage. For example, segmenting full names into first names and last names.
2. **Blocking or Indexing:**
    
    - This step reduces the number of record pairs to be compared by <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">grouping similar records based on specific attributes</mark> (e.g., birth date or zip code).
    - It ensures that only potential matches are compared, thereby increasing efficiency.
3. **Record Pair Comparison:**
    
    - For every record in one dataset, compare it to records in another dataset.
    - Utilize algorithms or techniques to <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">determine the similarity between two records. Commonly used metrics include Jaccard similarity, cosine similarity</mark>, or edit distance for textual data.
4. **Decision Making:**
    
    - Based on the comparison, decide <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">whether a pair of records refers to the same entity</mark>.
    - This can be a deterministic approach where rules are set (e.g., if two records have the same name and birthdate, they're considered a match).
    - Alternatively, probabilistic linkage can be used, where weights are assigned to matches and mismatches for various fields, and records are linked based on a threshold score.
5. **Evaluation:**
    
    - Assess the quality of the linkage using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.
    - This step often requires a manually curated set of true matches (ground truth) to compare against.
6. **Post-Linkage Processing:**
    
    - **Clustering:** Group linked records to ensure that all records in a group refer to the same entity.
    - **Consolidation:** In situations with multiple linked records for the same entity, consolidate them into a single, 'golden' record. This can involve averaging, voting, or choosing the most recent value among linked records.
7. **Continuous Update & Review:**
    
    - As new data becomes available or entities change (e.g., someone changes their last name), the linkage process may need to be periodically reviewed and updated.
