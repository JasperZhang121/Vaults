- Equal Width Binning : **bins have equal width with a range of each bin** are defined as [min + w], [min + 2w] …. [min + nw] where w = (max – min) / (no of bins).

- Equal depth (or frequency) binning : **In equal-frequency binning we divide the range [A, B] of the variable into intervals that contain (approximately) equal number of points**; equal frequency may not be possible due to repeated values.
