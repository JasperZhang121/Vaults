- Matches: These are record pairs that are identified as referring to the same entity or representing the same real-world object. For example, two records with similar names and addresses might be considered a match.
    
- Non-Matches: Non-match pairs are clearly distinct and do not represent the same entity. These pairs are unrelated and should be treated as separate entities.
    
- Potential Matches: Record pairs that are not definitively classified as matches or non-matches based on initial similarity metrics. These pairs require further investigation or more advanced classification techniques to determine their true status.

Record pair classification is conducted using their <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">calculated similarity vectors</mark>. These vectors capture the similarity between records across various attributes, such as names, addresses, or dates of birth.


### Different classification techniques

- Threshold based classification and weighted threshold based classification

	- A user-defined threshold(s) are used to classify record pairs into different classes
	- More weights are given to attributes that contain more information

- Probabilistic classification

	- Based on matching and non-matching probabilities for individual attributes (assuming conditional independence)
	- Require ground truth to calculate the probabilities

- Cost-based classification

	- Based on costs associated with true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives
	- Aim to minimize the total cost for classifying all record pairs

- Rule-based classification

    - A set of rules is used to classify a record pair as a match or non-match
    - Rules are applied to the calculated attribute similarities

- Machine learning-based classification

    - Supervised machine learning: Requires training data in the form of ground truth
    - Unsupervised machine learning: Involves clustering similar data points
    - Active learning: Prioritizes record pair classification that is most important for the model and may involve interaction with domain experts to make better decisions
