When performing record linkage or deduplication, the **blocking** process reduces the number of candidate pairs to be compared. Evaluating its effectiveness involves several metrics:
### 1. **Reduction Ratio (RR)**
- Represents the effectiveness of a blocking scheme in reducing candidate pairs.
- **Formula**:
  $RR = 1 - \frac{\text{number of candidate pairs after blocking}}{\text{total number of possible pairs without blocking}}$
- A higher RR means better efficiency in reducing comparisons.

### 2. **Pairs Completeness (PC)**
- Measures the percentage of true matches retained post-blocking.
- **Formula**:
  $PC = \frac{\text{number of true matches in the candidate pairs after blocking}}{\text{total number of true matches}}$
- A high PC means most true matches are retained, ensuring effectiveness. But a very high PC with a low RR might indicate inefficient blocking.

### 3. **Pairs Quality (PQ)**
- Evaluates the proportion of true matches among retained candidate pairs.
- **Formula**:
  $PQ = \frac{\text{number of true matches in the candidate pairs after blocking}}{\text{total number of candidate pairs after blocking}}$
- A higher PQ indicates that a larger proportion of the retained pairs are true matches, suggesting efficient filtering.

Ideally, you'd aim for an RR close to 1, and both PC and PQ also close to 1. However, there's often a trade-off between efficiency (RR) and effectiveness (PC and PQ). The desired balance depends on the specifics of your use case, considering the costs of missed true matches versus the computational costs of extra comparisons.

### Example

Imagine we're working with two small datasets, each containing 10 records. Without blocking, we'd have to compare every record from the first dataset with every record from the second, resulting in 10Ã—10=100 comparisons.

Now, suppose out of these 100 possible pairs:

- 5 pairs are actual matches (true matches).
- The remaining 95 pairs are not matches.

Let's assume our blocking method reduces our comparison to just 20 candidate pairs. Of these:

- 4 pairs are true matches.
- The remaining 16 pairs are not matches.

1. Reduction Ratio (RR)**:
$RR = 1 - \frac{20}{100} = 0.8$ 
So, RR is 0.8 or 80%, meaning we've reduced 80% of the comparisons.

2. **Pairs Completeness (PC)**:
$PC = \frac{4}{5} = 0.8$
So, PC is 0.8 or 80%, indicating we've retained 80% of the true matches.

3. **Pairs Quality (PQ)**:
$PQ = \frac{4}{20} = 0.2$
PQ is 0.2 or 20%, meaning that 20% of the candidate pairs we're comparing post-blocking are true matches.

In summary, our blocking method:
- Reduced comparisons by 80%.
- Retained 80% of the true matches.
- Ensured that 20% of the pairs it kept for comparison were true matches.
