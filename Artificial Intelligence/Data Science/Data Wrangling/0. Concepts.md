Data wrangling, also known as data munging, is the process of <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">transforming raw data into a more digestible</mark>, usable format. In the real world, data is often messy and complex. It is hardly ever ready to use straightaway for meaningful analysis or machine learning models. Data wrangling is therefore a critical step to clean, structure, and enrich these raw datasets to make them suitable for further processing or analysis.

### Importantance

**Data Quality:** Clean and well-structured data leads to more reliable outcomes and insights. Good data wrangling practices ensure that the data used in any analysis or modeling is accurate and of high quality.

**Efficient Analysis:** Well-prepared data simplifies and speeds up the data analysis process, reducing the amount of time spent on debugging and troubleshooting.

**Better Decision Making:** Clean and accurate data results in better, data-driven decisions. Messy data can lead to incorrect insights, which can negatively impact decision-making.
