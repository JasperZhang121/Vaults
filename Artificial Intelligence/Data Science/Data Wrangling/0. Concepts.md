Data wrangling, also known as data munging, is the process of <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">transforming raw data into a more digestible</mark>, usable format. In the real world, data is often messy and complex. It is hardly ever ready to use straightaway for meaningful analysis or machine learning models. Data wrangling is therefore a critical step to clean, structure, and enrich these raw datasets to make them suitable for further processing or analysis.
### Main Data Wrangling
- Data extraction 
- Data quality assessment 
- Data profiling (exploration, summarisation, and visualisation) 
- Data cleaning (transformation, reshaping, aggregation, reduction, imputation, parsing, standardisation) 
- Data integration (schema matching and mapping, data matching, record linkage, deduplication, data fusion)
### Outcomes of Data Wrangling
- Understanding and characterisation of the quality aspects of a given data set or database 
- Cleaned, standardised, consistent and integrated data in a format that is suitable for the further processing and/or analytics tasks at hand 
- Documentation of the data quality assessment, profiling, exploration and cleaning conducted
