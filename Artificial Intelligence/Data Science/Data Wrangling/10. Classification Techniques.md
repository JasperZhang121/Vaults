### 1. Similarity Threshold Based Classification:

This classification method is based on a similarity measure. For a new sample to be classified, its similarity with existing samples in the database is calculated. If the similarity exceeds a preset threshold, then the sample is classified into the same class as the most similar sample.

**Formula**:
$\text{classify}(x) = \begin{cases} c & \text{if } \text{similarity}(x, s) > T \\\text{undefined} &\text{otherwise} \end{cases}$

Where:
- $x$ is the new sample to be classified.
- $s$ is the most similar sample in the database.
- $c$ is the class of the sample $s$.
- $T$ is the preset similarity threshold.

### 2. Minimum Similarity Threshold Based Classification:

It's a variation of the above method. Instead of classifying the new sample based on the highest similarity, the sample is classified into a certain class if its similarity with any sample from that class exceeds a preset minimum threshold.

**Formula**:
$\text{classify}(x) = \begin{cases} c & \text{if } \text{min\_similarity}(x, C) >{T}\\\text{undefined} & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$

Where:
- \( C \) represents all samples of a certain class.
- $\text{min\_similarity}(x, C)$ is the minimum similarity between $x$ and any sample in $C$ .

### 3. Weighted Similarity Threshold Based Classification:

This method assigns weights to the similarities between the sample to be classified and existing samples. This is useful when certain samples are more important or trustworthy than others. Classification is based on the weighted average similarity, which must exceed a threshold.

**Formula**:
$\text{classify}(x) = \begin{cases} c & \text{if } \frac{\sum w_i \times \text{similarity}(x, s_i)}{\sum w_i} > T \\\text{undefined} & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$

Where:
- $w_i$  is the weight of similarity with the i-th sample  $s_i$.

### 4. Supervised Decision Tree Classifier:

A decision tree classifier is a tree-shaped diagram used to determine a course of action. Each branch of the tree represents a decision or a test on an attribute, and each leaf node represents a class label. This method is supervised as it requires labeled training data to build the tree.

For instance, in a decision tree for classifying animals, the tree might have a branch that tests whether the animal has fur. If it does, then there could be further branches testing other attributes (like whether it has a tail, size, etc.), leading ultimately to a classification like 'cat', 'dog', etc.
