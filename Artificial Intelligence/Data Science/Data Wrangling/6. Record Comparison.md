- Record pairs are compared based on their common available attributes (fields) 
	- Names, addresses, dates, etc. 
	- Contain errors 
- Exact comparison will not provide good results 
- Approximate comparison functions are required

### Comparison functions
- Numerical comparison
	- Using absolute maximum difference and maximum percentage difference
- Date and time comparison
  - Dates and times can be converted into numbers by counting the number of days/hours/minutes since a certain fixed date/time, then calculate numerical similarity between these numbers
- String comparison
  - Q-gram based functions such as <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Jaccard and Dice similarity</mark>
  - Edit distance – number of edit operations needed to go from one string to another
  - Bag distance – fast approximation of edit distance
  - <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Jaro and Jaro-Winkler</mark> comparison

### Formula

- Jaccard similarity:
  - $Jaccard(s1, s2) = \frac{|Q1 \cap Q2|}{|Q1 \cup Q2|}$

- Dice similarity:
  - $Dice(s1, s2) = \frac{2 \cdot |Q1 \cap Q2|}{|Q1| + |Q2|}$

- Bag distance:
  - $Bag\_distance(s1, s2) = \max(|s1-s2|,|s2-s1|)$
  - $Bag\_distance\_sim(s1,s2) = max(|s1-s2|,|s2-s1|)/max(len(s1),len(s2))$

Where Qx is the set of q-grams extracted from string sx. The Bag distance here using multi-set instead of set, and the |s1-s2| is the cardinality after a set minus.

### Complexity

- Jaccard and Dice
	- q-gram sets of the two strings which can be done with a linear scan with complexity O((l1 – q + 1) + (l2 – q + 1) ) -> O(l1 + l2)
- Two sets containing n and m elements respectively
	- The complexity for obtaining the set union is O(n + m) 
	- The complexity for obtaining the set intersection is O(min(n, m))
- Note that maximum n = l1 – q + 1 and maximum m = l2 – q + 1
- Therefore, O(n + m) -> O(l1 + l2) and O(min(n, m)) -> O(min(l1, l2))


### Jaro similarity

- s1 = "arnab"
- s2 = "aranby"
- d = 2 (half the distance of the longer string -> max(|s1|, |s2|) / 2 - 1)
- c = 5 (number of characters that agree within the distance d)
- t = 1 (number of transpositions within the distance d)

jaro_sim(s1, s2) = 1/3 (c/|s1| + c/|s2| + (c-t)/c) = 0.8778

#### Jaro-Winkler

Jaro-Winkler(s1,s2)=Jaro(s1,s2)+(l⋅p⋅(1−Jaro(s1,s2)))

- **Jaro(s1, s2):** Jaro(s1, s2) represents the Jaro similarity between strings s1 and s2.
- **l:** l is the length of the common prefix between s1 and s2, up to a maximum prefix length of 4.
- **p:** p is a constant scaling factor (typically set to a small value like 0.1) that controls how much additional weight is given to the common prefix.

### Numerical with maximum percentage difference

- pd = 100* abs(n1 – n2) / max(n1, n2)
	- sim = 1.0 – (pd / pd_max) if pd < pd_max 
	- sim = 0.0 else.
