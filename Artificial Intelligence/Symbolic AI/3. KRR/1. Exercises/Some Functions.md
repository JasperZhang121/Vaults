arc 3

```python
def arc_consistency(var: Optional[str], assignment: Assignment, gamma: CSP) -> Optional[Pruned]:  
    """Implement the AC-3 inference procedure.  
  
    Parameters    ----------    var : Optional[str]        The name of the variable which has just been assigned. In the case that        AC-3 is used for preprocessing, `var` will be `None`.    assignment : Dict[str, str]        A Python dictionary of the current assignment. The dictionary maps        variable names to values. The function cannot change anything in        `assignment`.    gamma : CSP        An instance of the class CSP, representing the constraint network        to which we are looking for a solution. The function cannot change        anything in `gamma`.  
    Returns    -------    pruned_list : Optional[Pruned]        In the case that the algorithm detects a conflict, the assignment and        CSP should remain unchanged and the function should return None.
