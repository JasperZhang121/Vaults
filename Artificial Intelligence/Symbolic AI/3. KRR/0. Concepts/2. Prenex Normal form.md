A way of writing first-order logic formulas in a standard form that simplifies the process of inference and proof. PNF is achieved by converting a first-order logic formula into a form where all quantifiers are at the beginning of the formula.

To convert a formula to PNF, the following steps are typically performed:

1.  Elimination of existential quantifiers: First, we eliminate all existential quantifiers by using Skolemization, which involves replacing each existential quantifier with a function that takes as input the universally quantified variables in the formula. The Skolem function must be constructed such that it satisfies any constraints specified by the existential quantifier.
    
2.  Standardization of variables: We then rename variables in the formula to avoid name clashes. This ensures that no two variables in the formula have the same name.
    
3.  Moving universal quantifiers to the front: Finally, we move all universal quantifiers to the beginning of the formula.

### Quantifiers in first-order logic:

1.  <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Universal</mark> Instantiation (UI): If ∀x P(x) is true, then P(a) is true for any individual a in the domain of discourse.
    
2.  <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Existential</mark> Generalization (EG): If P(a) is true for some individual a in the domain of discourse, then ∃x P(x) is true.
    
3.  Universal Generalization (UG): If P(a) is true for any individual a in the domain of discourse, then ∀x P(x) is true.
    
4.  Existential Instantiation (EI): If ∃x P(x) is true, then we can introduce a new individual constant a and replace x with a in P(x) to obtain P(a).
    
5.  Quantifier Negation Rules:
    
-   ¬∀x P(x) is equivalent to ∃x ¬P(x)
-   ¬∃x P(x) is equivalent to ∀x ¬P(x)

6.  Quantifier Exchange Rule:

-   ∀x∃y P(x,y) is equivalent to ∃y∀x P(x,y)

7.  Skolemization: Eliminating existential quantifiers by introducing Skolem functions or constants.
    
8.  Quantifier Distribution: Distributing a quantifier over a conjunction or disjunction, using the following rules:
    

-   ∀x (P(x) ∧ Q(x)) is equivalent to (∀x P(x)) ∧ (∀x Q(x))
-   ∃x (P(x) ∧ Q(x)) is equivalent to (∃x P(x)) ∧ (∃x Q(x))
-   ∀x (P(x) ∨ Q(x)) is equivalent to (∀x P(x)) ∨ (∀x Q(x))
-   ∃x (P(x) ∨ Q(x)) is equivalent to (∃x P(x)) ∨ (∃x Q(x))

### Skolemization

is a technique used in first-order logic to <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">eliminate existential quantifiers from a formula by introducing Skolem functions or Skolem constants</mark>. The resulting formula is logically equivalent to the original formula, but without any existential quantifiers.

Skolemization is based on the idea that if a formula has an existential quantifier, then there must exist an object that satisfies the formula. Skolemization introduces a new function or constant symbol that represents this object, allowing us to eliminate the existential quantifier.

There are two types of Skolemization: Skolem functions and Skolem constants. Skolem functions are introduced for formulas with free variables, while Skolem constants are introduced for closed formulas.

To perform Skolemization using Skolem functions, we follow these steps:

1.  Identify the innermost existential quantifier in the formula.
2.  Introduce a new Skolem function symbol with the same arity as the quantified variable.
3.  Replace the quantified variable with the Skolem function applied to a tuple of the free variables in the quantifier's scope.
4.  Repeat the process for all remaining existential quantifiers in the formula.

For example, consider the formula ∃x P(x,y). To Skolemize this formula using a Skolem function, we introduce a new function symbol f and replace the existential quantifier with the function applied to y: P(f(y),y).

To perform Skolemization using Skolem constants, we follow these steps:

1.  Identify the innermost existential quantifier in the formula.
2.  Introduce a new Skolem constant symbol.
3.  Replace the quantified variable with the Skolem constant.
4.  Repeat the process for all remaining existential quantifiers in the formula.

For example, consider the formula ∃x P(x,y). To Skolemize this formula using a Skolem constant, we introduce a new constant symbol c and replace the existential quantifier with the constant: P(c,y).

Skolemization allows us to transform a formula with existential quantifiers into an equivalent formula without existential quantifiers. This can simplify reasoning about the formula and make it easier to manipulate using other logical techniques.
