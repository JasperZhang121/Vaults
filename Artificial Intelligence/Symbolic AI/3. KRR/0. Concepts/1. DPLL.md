DPLL stands for Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland, which is a well-known algorithm used for solving the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Boolean satisfiability problem</mark> (SAT). The SAT problem is the problem of determining whether a given Boolean formula can be satisfied by assigning true or false values to its variables.

The DPLL algorithm is a <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">backtracking search algorithm</mark> that works by iteratively simplifying the input formula until a satisfying assignment is found or it is determined that no such assignment exists. At each step, the algorithm selects a variable and assigns it a value (true or false) and then simplifies the formula by <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">removing clauses that are satisfied by that assignment, as well as any literals that are contradictory to that assignment</mark>. This process is repeated until the formula is reduced to either a single clause (which is trivially satisfiable) or an unsatisfiable formula, in which case the algorithm backtracks to the most recent decision point and tries a different assignment.

One of the strengths of the DPLL algorithm is its ability to take advantage of the structure of the input formula and to <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">use heuristics to guide the search</mark>. For example, it can use unit propagation, which identifies clauses with only one unassigned literal and assigns that literal a value, and pure literal elimination, which identifies literals that appear only with a single polarity in the formula and assigns them the corresponding value. These techniques can help to reduce the size of the search space and make the algorithm more efficient.

The DPLL algorithm is widely used in automated reasoning and is a key component of many SAT solvers, which are used in a variety of applications such as circuit design, verification, planning, and scheduling.

### Unit propagation

A technique used in the DPLL algorithm for solving the satisfiability problem. It is a rule of inference that says that if a clause contains only <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">one literal that has not been assigned a truth value, then that literal must be assigned a truth value that makes the clause true</mark>.

The idea behind unit propagation is to simplify the search space by identifying these unit clauses and assigning the necessary truth value to their literals. This process can create new unit clauses that are identified in subsequent iterations, leading to a chain reaction of assignments until either a satisfying truth assignment is found or a contradiction is reached.

The steps of unit propagation are:

1.  Assign truth values to <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">pure literals</mark> (literals that always appear with the same sign in the formula / whose complement does not appear anywhere).
2.  Identify unit clauses (clauses with only <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">one unassigned literal</mark>) and assign truth values to the unassigned literal(s) in them.
3.  Propagate these truth assignments by removing all clauses containing the assigned literals, and removing the negation of the assigned literals from all remaining clauses.
4.  Repeat steps 1-3 until no more unit clauses or pure literals can be found.

### Clause learning

A technique used to improve the efficiency of the DPLL algorithm for solving propositional satisfiability (SAT) problems. In DPLL, when a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">conflict is detected</mark> in the search process, the algorithm backtracks to a previous decision level and makes a new choice. Clause learning is a way to avoid making the same choice again by learning new clauses from the conflict.

When a conflict occurs, the DPLL algorithm learns a new clause that captures the reason for the conflict, called the "conflict clause." This clause is added to the knowledge base and prevents the algorithm from making the same choices that led to the conflict. By adding more and more conflict clauses to the knowledge base, the algorithm becomes more efficient and can solve SAT problems faster.

The basic idea of clause learning is to use the conflict clause to <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">prune the search space</mark>. When a conflict is detected, the algorithm backtracks to the last decision level and adds the conflict clause to the knowledge base. The algorithm then tries to find a new assignment that satisfies the updated knowledge base. If the updated knowledge base is still unsatisfiable, the algorithm generates a new conflict clause and adds it to the knowledge base. This process continues until a satisfying assignment is found or the algorithm determines that the problem is unsatisfiable.

### Further improvement

Use a more sophisticated branching heuristic to choose which variable to assign a value to. A good heuristic can help the algorithm to quickly find a satisfying assignment.

- One popular heuristic is the "<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">most frequent literal</mark>" rule, which chooses the literal that appears most frequently in the clauses of the formula. Another common heuristic is the "maximum occurences" rule, which chooses the literal that appears in the most number of clauses, regardless of whether it appears positively or negatively.

- Other heuristics include the "Jeroslow-Wang rule," which assigns scores to literals based on how often they appear in long clauses, and the "VSIDS" (Variable State Independent Decaying Sum) rule, which assigns scores to literals based on how often they were involved in conflicts during the search.

- In addition to branching heuristics, other techniques such as clause deletion and <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">backjumping</mark> can also be used to improve the efficiency of the algorithm.

The general form of the DPLL algorithm is as follows:

1.  Input: A set of propositional clauses
2.  Initialize an empty assignment set
3.  Repeat until a satisfying assignment is found or it is proven that no such assignment exists:
    1.  If all clauses are satisfied by the current assignment, return the assignment
    2.  If there exists an unsatisfied clause that contains only one literal, assign the corresponding variable to the truth value that makes the clause true
    3.  If there exists an unsatisfied clause that contains only literals that are already assigned false, backtrack by undoing the last decision and assigning the opposite truth value to the variable
    4.  If neither of the above cases apply, select an unassigned variable and assign it to true
4.  Return "unsatisfiable"

Example:
```
(¬p ∨ ¬q ∨ r)
(p ∨ ¬r)
(¬p ∨ q ∨ r)
(¬r ∨ s)
```

1.  Initialize an empty assignment set
2.  Select `p` and assign it to `true`
3.  Simplify the clauses:
    -   `(¬p ∨ ¬q ∨ r)` becomes `(¬q ∨ r)`
    -   `(p ∨ ¬r)` becomes `(true)`
    -   `(¬p ∨ q ∨ r)` becomes `(q ∨ r)`
    -   `(¬r ∨ s)` remains unchanged
4.  Select `q` and assign it to `true`
5.  Simplify the clauses:
    -   `(¬q ∨ r)` becomes `(r)`
    -   `(q ∨ r)` becomes `(true)`
    -   `(¬r ∨ s)` remains unchanged
6.  All clauses are satisfied by the current assignment, so return `{p:true, q:true, r:true}` as the satisfying assignment.
