A constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) is a computational problem that involves finding a solution to a set of constraints that restrict the possible values of variables in a problem domain. The goal of a CSP is to find a valid assignment of values to variables that satisfies all the constraints. CSPs are used in a variety of fields, such as artificial intelligence, operations research, and computer science. Some examples of CSPs include scheduling problems, routing problems, and puzzle-solving problems like Sudoku.

```python
function pureBacktracking(csp):
    return backtrack({}, csp)

function backtrack(assignment, csp):
    if assignment is complete:
        return assignment
    var = selectUnassignedVariable(csp, assignment)
    for value in orderDomainValues(var, assignment, csp):
        if isConsistent(var, value, assignment, csp):
            assignment[var] = value
            inferences = inference(var, value, assignment, csp)
            if inferences is not failure:
                assignment = assignment + inferences
                result = backtrack(assignment, csp)
                if result is not failure:
                    return result
            del assignment[var]
            undoInferences(inferences, assignment, csp)
    return failure
```

Backtracking with inference (also known as backtracking with forward checking) is an algorithm used to solve constraint satisfaction problems. The basic idea behind the algorithm is to use backtracking search to explore the space of possible solutions, but to make use of inference to reduce the size of the search space whenever possible.

The algorithm works by maintaining a set of domains, one for each variable in the problem. At the beginning, each domain contains all possible values for the corresponding variable. As the algorithm proceeds, it selects a variable to assign a value to and removes all other values from its domain. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Then, the algorithm performs inference to propagate the constraints that have been violated by this assignment to other variables, and updates their domains accordingly</mark>.

If a variable's domain becomes empty, the algorithm backtracks to the most recently assigned variable and tries a different value. In this way, the algorithm systematically explores the space of possible solutions until a solution is found or all possible combinations of variable assignments have been exhausted.

```c
function backtrackWithInference(assignment, csp):
    if assignment is complete:
        return assignment
    var = selectUnassignedVariable(csp)
    for value in orderDomainValues(var, assignment, csp):
        if isConsistent(var, value, assignment, csp):
            assignment[var] = value
            inferences = inference(var, value, assignment, csp)
            if inferences != failure:
                for (variable, value) in inferences:
                    assignment[variable] = value
                result = backtrackWithInference(assignment, csp)
                if result != failure:
                    return result
                for (variable, value) in inferences:
                    removeValueFromDomain(variable, value, csp)
            del assignment[var]
    return failure
```

### Value ordering

A technique used in constraint satisfaction problems to decide the order in which values are assigned to variables. The idea is to choose a variable and assign it a value from its domain that has the highest likelihood of leading to a solution, or the lowest likelihood of leading to a dead-end.

There are many methods for value ordering, including:

1.  Minimum Remaining Values (MRV): This heuristic selects the variable with the fewest remaining values in its domain, which is likely to lead to a quick resolution of the constraint.
    
2.  Least Constraining Value (LCV): This heuristic chooses the value that rules out the fewest choices for neighboring variables, which is likely to increase the chance of finding a solution in the long run.
    
3.  Degree Heuristic: This heuristic selects the variable that has the most constraints on remaining variables, which is likely to help prune the search space more quickly.
    
4.  Random Value: This heuristic selects a value at random from the domain of the variable.
    

These methods can be used alone or in combination with each other to improve the efficiency of the backtracking algorithm.
