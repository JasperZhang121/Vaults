A constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) is a computational problem that involves finding a solution to a set of constraints that restrict the possible values of variables in a problem domain. The goal of a CSP is to find a valid assignment of values to variables that satisfies all the constraints. CSPs are used in a variety of fields, such as artificial intelligence, operations research, and computer science. Some examples of CSPs include scheduling problems, routing problems, and puzzle-solving problems like Sudoku.

```java
function pureBacktracking(csp):
    return backtrack({}, csp)

function backtrack(assignment, csp):
    if assignment is complete:
        return assignment
    var = selectUnassignedVariable(csp, assignment)
    for value in orderDomainValues(var, assignment, csp):
        if isConsistent(var, value, assignment, csp):
            assignment[var] = value
            inferences = inference(var, value, assignment, csp)
            if inferences is not failure:
                assignment = assignment + inferences
                result = backtrack(assignment, csp)
                if result is not failure:
                    return result
            del assignment[var]
            undoInferences(inferences, assignment, csp)
    return failure
```

Backtracking with inference (also known as backtracking with forward checking) is an algorithm used to solve constraint satisfaction problems. The basic idea behind the algorithm is to use backtracking search to explore the space of possible solutions, but to make use of inference to reduce the size of the search space whenever possible.

The algorithm works by maintaining a set of domains, one for each variable in the problem. At the beginning, each domain contains all possible values for the corresponding variable. As the algorithm proceeds, it selects a variable to assign a value to and removes all other values from its domain. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Then, the algorithm performs inference to propagate the constraints that have been violated by this assignment to other variables, and updates their domains accordingly</mark>.

If a variable's domain becomes empty, the algorithm backtracks to the most recently assigned variable and tries a different value. In this way, the algorithm systematically explores the space of possible solutions until a solution is found or all possible combinations of variable assignments have been exhausted.

```c
function backtrackWithInference(assignment, csp):
    if assignment is complete:
        return assignment
    var = selectUnassignedVariable(csp)
    for value in orderDomainValues(var, assignment, csp):
        if isConsistent(var, value, assignment, csp):
            assignment[var] = value
            inferences = inference(var, value, assignment, csp)
            if inferences != failure:
                for (variable, value) in inferences:
                    assignment[variable] = value
                result = backtrackWithInference(assignment, csp)
                if result != failure:
                    return result
                for (variable, value) in inferences:
                    removeValueFromDomain(variable, value, csp)
            del assignment[var]
    return failure
```

### Value ordering

A technique used in constraint satisfaction problems to decide the order in which values are assigned to variables. The idea is to choose a variable and assign it a value from its domain that has the highest likelihood of leading to a solution, or the lowest likelihood of leading to a dead-end.

There are many methods for value ordering, including:

1.  Minimum Remaining Values (MRV): This heuristic selects the variable with the fewest remaining values in its domain, which is likely to lead to a quick resolution of the constraint.
    
2.  Least Constraining Value (LCV): This heuristic chooses the value that rules out the fewest choices for neighboring variables, which is likely to increase the chance of finding a solution in the long run.
    
3.  Degree Heuristic: This heuristic selects the variable that has the most constraints on remaining variables, which is likely to help prune the search space more quickly.
    
4.  Random Value: This heuristic selects a value at random from the domain of the variable.
    

These methods can be used alone or in combination with each other to improve the efficiency of the backtracking algorithm.

### Arc Consistency

Arc consistency is a property of constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) where every value in a variable's domain is consistent with every value in the domains of its neighbors, given the constraints between them. This means that for every pair of variables (X, Y) connected by a constraint, if a value in X's domain is incompatible with every possible value of Y, then that value is removed from X's domain. This process is repeated for all variables until no values can be removed. The resulting CSP is said to be arc consistent. Arc consistency is an important property for efficient constraint satisfaction algorithms.

Arc consistency is a technique used in constraint satisfaction problems to reduce the domain of variables to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">make backtracking more efficient</mark>. It involves examining pairs of variables and checking if one can be eliminated from the other's domain. If a variable's domain is reduced, it can help to<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;"> prune the search tree and avoid unnecessary backtracking</mark>.
Arc consistency can be achieved through the use of<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> a queue that stores pairs</mark> of variables to be checked. This process can be repeated <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">until no more variables can be removed from any domains</mark>, or until all domains are reduced to a single value. Once arc consistency is achieved, backtracking with forward checking or other inference techniques can be applied to solve the CSP efficiently.
