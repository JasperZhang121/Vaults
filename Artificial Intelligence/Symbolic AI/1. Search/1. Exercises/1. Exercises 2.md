**Admissible:**
In the context of heuristic functions for search problems, a heuristic function h is said to be admissible if it never overestimates the actual cost to reach the goal node from a given state. In other words, the heuristic value h(n) for any node n is always less than or equal to the true cost of the optimal path from n to the goal node. A* search algorithm, which is widely used for solving pathfinding problems, guarantees an optimal solution if the heuristic function used is admissible.

$$h(n) \leq h^{*}(n)$$

where h(n) is the estimated cost of the cheapest path from node n to the goal, and h*(n) is the actual cost of the cheapest path from node n to the goal.

A heuristic function h(n) is said to be consistent if, for every node n and every successor n' of n generated by any action a, the estimated cost of reaching the goal from n is no greater than the step cost of getting to n' plus the estimated cost of reaching the goal from n'. This can be written as:

$h(n) \leq c(n, a, n') + h(n')$

where c(n, a, n') is the cost of applying action a from node n to reach n'.


### 1. Heuristic function properties
> Consider the search problem shown on the left. It has only three states, and three directed edges. A is the start node and G is the goal node. To the right, four different heuristic functions are defined, numbered I through IV.

```
graph = {A:{G:6,B:2}, B{C:3}}
```

|    | h(A) | h(B) | h(G) |
|----|------|------|------|
| I  | 4    | 1    | 0    |
| II | 6    | 3    | 0    |
| III| 4    | 3    | 0    |
| IV | 5    | 2    | 0    |


**Admissible:**
```
A heuristic function h(n) is admissible if it satisfies the condition that at every node n, the function does not overestimate the cost h*(n) of the shortest path from n to the closest goal node, that is, h(n) ≤ h*(n). It should be noted that if n is a goal node, then h(n) = 0.

Heuristic II is the only inadmissible heuristic as it overestimates the cost from A. Specifically, h(A) = 6, while the actual cost of the shortest path from A to G is 5. The other heuristics are admissible and this can be easily verified from the given table. For instance, heuristic I satisfies the admissibility condition since h(A) = 4 ≤ 5, h(B) = 1 ≤ 3, and h(G) = 0 ≤ 0.
```

**Consistent**
```
A consistent heuristic satisfies the condition that the heuristic doesn’t decrease by more than the cost between any node n and its successor n0: i.e. h(n) − h(n0) ≤ c(n, n0). In this problem, h(G) is always 0, so making sure that the direct paths to the goal (A → G and B → G) are consistent is the same as making sure that the heuristic value at the start of the path is admissible.

Now, for the path from A to B, the analysis is as follows:

-   Heuristic I is not consistent: h(A) − h(B) = 4 − 1 = 3 > c(A, B) = 2.
-   Heuristic II is not consistent: recall that consistency implies admissibility, and II is not admissible.
-   Heuristic III is consistent: h(A) − h(B) = 4 − 3 = 1 ≤ 2
-   Heuristic IV is not consistent: h(A) − h(B) = 5 − 2 = 3 > 2.

In summary, a heuristic is consistent if it doesn't overestimate the actual cost between a node and its successor, and if it satisfies the condition h(n) − h(n0) ≤ c(n, n0) for all nodes n and their successors n0. Among the four heuristics given in this problem, only heuristic III is both admissible and consistent.

### 2. Combining heuristics and heuristics for multiple goals

There are green and red objects on a grid. An agent must collect exactly one object of each color to reach the goal. The actions are moving south, north, east or west, and are only applicable when they don’t result in colliding with an obstacle (black) or exiting the grid. The agent collects an object when it first reaches the cell at which this object is. The state of the problem is represented as follows. Each state is a triple (a, G, R) where a is the location of the agent on the grid, G is the set locations of yet uncollected green objects, and R is the set of locations of yet uncollected red objects. Given two locations l1 and l2 on the grid, dist(l1, l2) returns the Manhattan distance between l1 and l2.


|    |  |  |  |
|----|------|------|------|-----|
| red| |green | | black|
| | agent| | |black |
| |black |black | | red|
| | |red | | green|

1. The sum of the Manhattan distances to the remaining objects?
```
No. We only need to collect 2 objects (one of each kind). The sum of the Manhattan distances to all

objects would greatly over-estimate the optimal cost of reaching just two of them. In fact, even if we

had to collect all objects, it would be an over-estimate, as it assumes that we need to come back to

the current location after collecting each object.
```

2. The number of remaining objects?
```
This heuristic will overestimate the optimal cost to the goal if there are a large number of objects and the distance to them is short. However, since only two objects need to be collected in this problem, this heuristic is not appropriate.
```


3. The smallest Manhattan distance to any remaining objects?
```
This heuristic is admissible because if the agent has not yet reached the goal, it must still collect at least one object of a given color while avoiding obstacles. We can simplify the problem by assuming that the agent only needs to collect one object of any color and can move through obstacles. The optimal solution to this simplified problem is the smallest Manhattan distance to any remaining object. Therefore, this heuristic provides a lower bound for the optimal cost of the original problem of reaching the goal from the current state.
```

4. The maximum Manhattan distance between any two remaining objects?
```
No. This is inadmissible, since adding extra objects does not increase the optimal solution for the problem but increases the heuristic.
