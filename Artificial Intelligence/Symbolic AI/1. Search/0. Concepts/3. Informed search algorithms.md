**Evaluation function:**
- Evaluation function f (n) = g(n) + h(n)  
-  estimate of “desirability”, usually problem-specific.  
- g(n) = cost so far to reach n  
- h(n) = estimated cost from n to the closest goal (heuristic) 
- f (n) = estimated total cost of path through n to goal
-> The lower f (n), the more desirable n is

### Greedy Search

• Evaluation function f (n) = h(n) (entirely heuristic) = estimate of cost from n to the closest goal
• E.g., hSLD(n) = straight-line distance from n to goal
• Greedy search expands the node that appears to be closest to goal

**Properties:**
-   Complete: No. It can get stuck in loops
    -   Complete in finite space with repeated-state checking
-   Time: O(b^m), but a good heuristic can give dramatic improvement
-   Space: O(b^m)
-   Optimal: No

### A star Search ([[A star]])
• Idea: <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">avoid expanding paths that are already expensive</mark> 
• Evaluation function f (n) = g(n) + h(n)
	-  g(n) = cost so far to reach n  
	-  h(n) = estimated cost from n to the closest goal  
	- f(n) = estimated total cost of path through n to goal

• <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Admissible</mark> heuristic:  
	– <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">∀n h(n) ≤ h∗(n)</mark> where h∗(n) is the true cost from n 
	– Also require h(n)≥0,so h(G)=0 for any goal G
• E.g., hSLD(n) never overestimates the actual road distance

• When h(n) is admissible, f(n) <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">never overestimates</mark> the total cost of the optimal path through n to the goal

• Theorem: if h is admissible, A∗ search finds the optimal solution

**Consistency**
• A heuristic is consistent if <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">h(n) ≤ c(n, a, n′) + h(n′)</mark>
• If h is consistent, then  
	- h is admissible, and  
	- f(n) is nondecreasing along any path: 
		f (n′) = g(n′) + h(n′)
				= g(n) + c(n, a, n′) + h(n′) ≥ g(n) + h(n)  
				= f(n)

-> Consequently, when expanding a node, we cannot get a node with a smaller f, and so the value of the best node on the frontier will never decrease.

• When we dequeue a node labelled with a new state, we found the optimal path to that state:

-> any other node m labelled with the same state satisfies f(n) ≤ f (m) and h(n) = h(m), hence g(n) ≤ g(m).


**Properties:**

A* expands  
- all nodes with f (n) < C (C is the optimal solution cost)
- some nodes with f (n) = C (but only one goal node) ∗
- no nodes with f (n) > C

• Complete: 
	Yes, if the heuristic function h(n) is admissible 
	
• Time: 
	Exponential in the worst case, but can be much faster with a good heuristic function 
	
• Space:
	Keeps all generated nodes in memory, so can be a lot of space in large search spaces 
	
• Optimal:
	Yes, if the heuristic function h(n) is admissible and consistent

### Admissible heuristics

Given two admissible heuristics ha, hb, if <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">hb(n) ≥ ha(n) for all n</mark> then 
-> hb dominates ha and is better for search

There is a trade-off between the accuracy of h and the time to compute h
