Propositional logic, also known as <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">sentential logic or propositional calculus</mark>, is a branch of logic that deals with propositions, or declarative statements that are either true or false. In propositional logic, propositions are represented by symbols or letters, and logical connectives are used to form compound propositions.

## Symbols and Connectives

Propositional logic uses symbols to represent propositions. These symbols can be any letter or combination of letters, but are typically represented by capital letters (e.g. P, Q, R).

Propositional logic also uses logical connectives to form compound propositions from simpler propositions. The most common logical connectives in propositional logic are:

-   Conjunction ( ∧ ): represents "and"
-   Disjunction ( ∨ ): represents "or"
-   Negation ( ¬ ): represents "not"
-   Implication ( → ): represents "if...then"
-   Equivalence ( ↔ ): represents "if and only if"

### Truth Tables

In propositional logic, truth tables are used to determine the truth value of a compound proposition based on the truth values of its component propositions. Truth tables show all possible combinations of truth values for the component propositions and the resulting truth value of the compound proposition.

### Logical Equivalence and Validity

Propositional logic also deals with logical equivalence and validity. Two propositions are logically equivalent if they always have the same truth value, regardless of the truth values of their component propositions. A compound proposition is valid if it is true for all possible combinations of truth values of its component propositions.

### Examples of Propositional Logic

#### Example 1

-   P: "It is raining outside."
    
-   Q: "I am staying indoors."
    
-   P ∧ Q: "It is raining outside and I am staying indoors."
    
-   P ∨ Q: "Either it is raining outside or I am staying indoors."
    
-   ¬P: "It is not raining outside."
    
-   P → Q: "If it is raining outside, then I am staying indoors."
    
-   P ↔ Q: "It is raining outside if and only if I am staying indoors."
    

#### Example 2

-   P: "The class is cancelled."
    
-   Q: "I can sleep in."
    
-   P ∧ Q: "The class is cancelled and I can sleep in."
    
-   P ∨ Q: "Either the class is cancelled or I can sleep in."
    
-   ¬Q: "I cannot sleep in."
    
-   P → Q: "If the class is cancelled, then I can sleep in."
    
-   P ↔ Q: "The class is cancelled if and only if I can sleep in."
    

#### Example 3

-   P: "I am hungry."
    
-   Q: "I will eat a sandwich."
    
-   P ∧ Q: "I am hungry and I will eat a sandwich."
    
-   P ∨ Q: "Either I am hungry or I will eat a sandwich."
    
-   ¬P: "I am not hungry."
    
-   P → Q: "If I am hungry, then I will eat a sandwich."
    
-   P ↔ Q: "I am hungry if and only if I will eat a sandwich."


#### Example 4

P: "It is raining outside." Q: "I am staying indoors." R: "I am reading a book."

-   (P ∧ Q) ∨ ¬R: "Either it is raining outside and I am staying indoors, or I am not reading a book."

This example combines three propositions using the conjunction ( ∧ ), disjunction ( ∨ ), and negation ( ¬ ) logical operators.

The entire formula reads as "Either it is raining outside and I am staying indoors, or I am not reading a book."

Here is the truth table for this formula:

| P | Q | R | (P ∧ Q) | ¬R | (P ∧ Q) ∨ ¬R |
|---|---|---|---------|----|--------------|
| T | T | T |    T    | F  |       T       |
| T | T | F |    T    | T  |       T       |
| T | F | T |    F    | F  |       F       |
| T | F | F |    F    | T  |       T       |
| F | T | T |    F    | F  |       F       |
| F | T | F |    F    | T  |       T       |
| F | F | T |    F    | F  |       F       |
| F | F | F |    F    | T  |       T       |

As we can see from the truth table, the formula is true in four out of eight possible truth value combinations for P, Q, and R.
