### What is Reasoning and Inference?

-   Reasoning and inference involve deriving new information or conclusions from existing knowledge
-   In Symbolic AI, this is done by representing knowledge in a symbolic form and applying logical rules
-   These processes are crucial for making decisions, solving problems, and learning from experience in AI systems

### Types of Reasoning in Symbolic AI

-   Deductive reasoning: deriving logical conclusions from given premises using logical rules
-   Inductive reasoning: generalizing from specific observations to form more general conclusions
-   Abductive reasoning: generating hypotheses to explain observations or data

### Inference Methods in Symbolic AI

-   Forward chaining: using available knowledge to derive new conclusions
-   Backward chaining: starting with a goal and working backward to determine the necessary conditions for that goal to be achieved

### Conclusion

-   Reasoning and inference are fundamental concepts in Symbolic AI
-   Understanding the different types of reasoning and methods of inference is crucial for developing effective Symbolic AI systems.
