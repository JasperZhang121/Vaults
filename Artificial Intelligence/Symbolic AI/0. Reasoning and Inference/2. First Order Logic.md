### Constants and variables

- Constant: A symbol that represents a fixed object or value, such as `3`, `"apple"`, or `"John"`.
- Variable: A symbol that represents any object or value, such as `x`, `y`, or `z`.

### Predicates

- Predicate: A symbol that represents a property or relation between objects or values.
- Examples:
  - `Even(x)`: `x` is an even number.
  - `Red(x)`: `x` is red.
  - `Loves(x,y)`: `x` loves `y`.

### Quantifiers

- Quantifier: A symbol that indicates how many objects or values satisfy a predicate.
- Universal quantifier (`∀`): All objects or values satisfy the predicate.
- Existential quantifier (`∃`): At least one object or value satisfies the predicate.
- Example: 
  - `∀x Red(x)`: All objects are red.
  - `∃x Loves(John,x)`: There is someone that John loves.

### Connectives

- Connective: A symbol that combines two or more logical expressions.
- Conjunction (`∧`): Both expressions are true.
- Disjunction (`∨`): At least one expression is true.
- Negation (`¬`): The expression is not true.
- Implication (`→`): If the first expression is true, then the second expression is also true.
- Example: 
  - `Red(x) ∧ Round(x)`: `x` is both red and round.
  - `Red(x) ∨ Blue(x)`: `x` is either red or blue.
  - `¬Red(x)`: `x` is not red.
  - `Loves(John,x) → Loves(x,John)`: If John loves `x`, then `x` loves John.
