### Constants and variables

- Constant: A symbol that represents a fixed object or value, such as `3`, `"apple"`, or `"John"`.
- Variable: A symbol that represents any object or value, such as `x`, `y`, or `z`.

### Predicates

- Predicate: A symbol that represents a property or relation between objects or values.
- Examples:
  - `Even(x)`: `x` is an even number.
  - `Red(x)`: `x` is red.
  - `Loves(x,y)`: `x` loves `y`.

### Quantifiers

- Quantifier: A symbol that indicates how many objects or values satisfy a predicate.
- Universal quantifier (`∀`): All objects or values satisfy the predicate.
- Existential quantifier (`∃`): At least one object or value satisfies the predicate.
- Example: 
  - `∀x Red(x)`: All objects are red.
  - `∃x Loves(John,x)`: There is someone that John loves.

### Connectives

- Connective: A symbol that combines two or more logical expressions.
- Conjunction (`∧`): Both expressions are true.
- Disjunction (`∨`): At least one expression is true.
- Negation (`¬`): The expression is not true.
- Implication (`→`): If the first expression is true, then the second expression is also true.
- Example: 
  - `Red(x) ∧ Round(x)`: `x` is both red and round.
  - `Red(x) ∨ Blue(x)`: `x` is either red or blue.
  - `¬Red(x)`: `x` is not red.
  - `Loves(John,x) → Loves(x,John)`: If John loves `x`, then `x` loves John.

### Transform first-order formulae into first-order clauses

1. Convert the formula to negation normal form (NNF): Eliminate implications and move negations inwards using logical equivalences.
2. Skolemize existential quantifiers: <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Replace existential quantifiers with Skolem function</mark>s or Skolem constants to eliminate them.
3. Distribute disjunctions over conjunctions: Apply the distributive law to ensure that disjunctions are only at the top level.
4. Convert quantifiers to prefixes: Write the quantifiers (∀x, ∃x) as prefixes before the formula to indicate the scope of quantification.
5. Eliminate universal quantifiers (∀x): Rename variables as necessary to ensure uniqueness, and remove the universal quantifiers by replacing them with the corresponding variables.
6. Convert the formula to conjunctive normal form (CNF): Split the formula into <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">a conjunction of clauses, where each clause is a disjunction of literals</mark>.
7. Standardize apart: Rename variables within each clause to ensure distinct names for each occurrence.
8. Resolve existentially quantified variables: Eliminate existentially quantified variables by introducing Skolem functions or Skolem constants.
9. Convert to first-order clauses: Each clause should be in the form of a disjunction of literals, where each literal is either an atomic predicate or its negation.

#### Example
$$∀x ∃y (P(x, y) → Q(x) ∧ R(y))$$

Step 1: Convert to NNF:
$$∀x ∃y (¬P(x, y) ∨ (Q(x) ∧ R(y)))$$

Step 2: Skolemize:
$$∀x (¬P(x, f(x)) ∨ (Q(x) ∧ R(f(x))))$$

Step 3: Distribute disjunction:
$$∀x (¬P(x, f(x)) ∨ Q(x)) ∧ (¬P(x, f(x)) ∨ R(f(x)))$$

Step 4: Convert quantifiers to prefixes:
$$(∀x) (∃y) (¬P(x, f(x)) ∨ Q(x)) ∧ (∀x) (∃y) (¬P(x, f(x)) ∨ R(f(x)))$$

Step 5: Eliminate universal quantifiers:
$$(¬P(x, f(x)) ∨ Q(x)) ∧ (¬P(x, f(x)) ∨ R(f(x)))$$

Step 6: Convert to CNF:
$$(¬P(x, f(x)) ∨ Q(x)) ∧ (¬P(x, f(x)) ∨ R(f(x)))$$

Step 7: Standardize apart: 
$$(¬P(x, f(x)) ∨ Q(x)) ∧ (¬P(x, f(x)) ∨ R(g(x)))$$

Step 8: Resolve existentially quantified variables: 
$$(¬P(x, f(x)) ∨ Q(x)) ∧ (¬P(x, f(x)) ∨ R(g(x)))$$

Step 9: Convert to first-order clauses: 
$${¬P(x, f(x)) ∨ Q(x), ¬P(x, f(x)) ∨ R(g(x))}$$
