### Domain-independent heuristics

Domain-independent heuristics are heuristics that can be applied to any planning problem <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">without specific domain knowledge</mark>. These heuristics provide estimates of the cost or distance to the goal state from a given state, helping guide the search algorithm towards more promising paths.

Here are a few examples of domain-independent heuristics:

1.  Goal counting heuristic: This heuristic counts the number of goal propositions that are not yet achieved in the current state. <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">It assumes that each action will achieve at least one goal proposition and provides an estimate of the remaining distance to the goal</mark>.
    
2.  Relaxed planning graph heuristic: This heuristic constructs a relaxed version of the planning graph, where all delete effects of actions are ignored. It then estimates the cost to achieve the goal state in this relaxed graph, which provides a lower bound on the actual cost in the original problem.
    
3.  Additive heuristic: This heuristic computes the sum of the costs of individual actions needed to achieve each goal proposition independently. It assumes that actions can be executed in any order and their costs can be summed up.
    

These heuristics are called domain-independent because they do not rely on specific knowledge about the domain, such as the structure of the planning operators or the specific goals. Instead, they provide general estimation techniques that can be applied to any planning problem. However, their effectiveness may vary depending on the characteristics of the problem and the quality of the heuristic function.
