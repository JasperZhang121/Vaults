### Domain-independent heuristics

Domain-independent heuristics are heuristics that can be applied to any planning problem <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">without specific domain knowledge</mark>. These heuristics provide estimates of the cost or distance to the goal state from a given state, helping guide the search algorithm towards more promising paths.

These heuristics are called domain-independent because they <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">do not rely on specific knowledge about the domain</mark>, such as the structure of the planning operators or the specific goals. Instead, they provide general estimation techniques that can be applied to any planning problem. However, their effectiveness may vary depending on the characteristics of the problem and the quality of the heuristic function.


### Goal counting heuristic
This heuristic counts the number of goal propositions that are not yet achieved in the current state. <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">It assumes that each action will achieve at least one goal proposition and provides an estimate of the remaining distance to the goal</mark>.


### Relaxed planning graph heuristic
This heuristic constructs a relaxed version of the planning graph, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">where all delete effects of actions are ignored</mark>. It then estimates the cost to achieve the goal state in this relaxed graph, which provides a lower bound on the actual cost in the original problem. 


#### Delete Relaxation (h FF):
By <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">ignoring the delete effects</mark>, the planning algorithm considers that once a proposition is achieved, it remains true throughout the plan execution. This simplification allows the planner to focus on <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">achieving the positive effects and finding a sequence of actions that satisfies the goal conditions without explicitly handling the removal of unwanted propositions</mark>.

```python
function h_FF(current_state, goal_state):
    h = 0
    for each proposition in goal_state:
        if proposition not in current_state:
            h = h + 1
    return h
```


### Additive heuristic
This heuristic computes the sum of the costs of individual actions needed to achieve each goal proposition independently. It assumes that actions can be executed in any order and their costs can be summed up.


### h max and h sum heuristics
Relaxation is a common technique used in heuristic search to simplify the problem by ignoring certain aspects. The h max and h sum heuristics are two relaxation techniques often used in domain-independent planning.

#### h max heuristic
The h max heuristic is based on the idea of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">ignoring the negative effects</mark> of actions during the relaxation process. By considering only the positive effects of actions and ignoring any negative effects, the h max heuristic provides an optimistic estimate of the cost to reach the goal state from a given state. It assumes that all actions <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">will have positive outcomes and no obstacles or conflicts will be encountered along the way</mark>. While the h max heuristic can overestimate the actual cost, it tends to be more informed than simpler heuristics like h 0 (zero heuristic) which assumes no action has any effect.

```python 
# Initialization
for each proposition p:
    if p belongs to the current state s:
        H[p] = 0
    else:
        H[p] = infinity

# Fixed point iteration
while not converged:
    for each action a:
        H[a] = max(H[p] for p in Pre(a))
        for each proposition p in EFF+(a):
            H[p] = min(H[p], H[a] + cost(a))

# Calculate h_max heuristic
h_max = max(H[p] for p in goal_state)

# Return h_max value
return h_max
```


#### h sum heuristic
The h sum heuristic takes relaxation a step further by <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">ignoring the interactions between subgoals</mark>. In this heuristic, the problem is further simplified by considering each subgoal independently and summing up the estimated costs to achieve each subgoal. The h sum heuristic assumes that achieving each subgoal is independent of achieving the others and that there are <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">no conflicts or dependencies among the subgoals</mark>. This approach can be useful when the subgoals are loosely connected or when the interactions between them do not significantly affect the overall cost. However, it can lead to suboptimal estimates when there are strong interactions or dependencies between the subgoals.

Both the h max and h sum heuristics are quick to compute and can provide initial estimates for planning problems. However, they may not always accurately reflect the true cost of achieving the goal state due to the simplifications made during relaxation. To improve the effectiveness of these heuristics, domain-specific knowledge, advanced search techniques, abstraction, and pattern databases can be employed to tailor the heuristics to the problem at hand and provide more accurate estimates.
