### Forward Search

Forward search is a simple and intuitive planning algorithm. It starts with the initial state and generates successor states by applying available actions. If a successor state is a goal state, the planning process terminates. Otherwise, the algorithm continues the search from the successor state.

### Backward Search

Backward search is a planning algorithm that starts with the goal state and works backward to the initial state. It generates predecessor states by applying available actions and checks if the predecessor state is the initial state. If it is, the planning process terminates. Otherwise, the algorithm continues the search from the predecessor state.

### Heuristic Search

Heuristic search algorithms, such as A* and IDA*, use heuristic functions to guide the search process. The heuristic function estimates the cost of reaching a goal state from a given state. The search algorithm then chooses the state with the lowest estimated cost and expands it.

### Graphplan

Graphplan is a classical planning algorithm that uses a propositional logic representation of the planning problem. It constructs a planning graph that represents the set of all possible states and actions in the planning problem. The planning graph is then used to find a valid plan.

### STRIPS

STRIPS (Stanford Research Institute Problem Solver) is a language and planning system for describing and solving problems in artificial intelligence. It was developed at SRI International in the 1960s and was one of the first automated planning systems.

The STRIPS language consists of a set of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">states, actions, and initial and goal states</mark>. The actions describe how the states can be changed, and the initial and goal states describe the starting and ending points of the problem. The actions are specified in terms of preconditions, which must be true for the action to be performed, and effects, which describe the changes that occur to the states when the action is performed.

STRIPS uses a forward-chaining inference algorithm to search for a plan that will take the system from the initial state to the goal state. The algorithm builds a search tree of possible plans, starting with the initial state and working forward through the actions until it reaches the goal state.

#### Example

Initial state: At(Robot, SFO) ∧ At(Cargo, SFO) ∧ CargoWeight(Cargo, Heavy)

Goal state: At(Robot, JFK)

Actions:
- Drive(From, To)
    Preconditions: At(Robot, From) ∧ Connected(From, To)
    Effects: ¬At(Robot, From) ∧ At(Robot, To)
- Load(Cargo, Plane)
    Preconditions: At(Robot, Airport) ∧ At(Cargo, Airport) ∧ CargoWeight(Cargo, Light) ∧ PlaneCapacity(Plane, Available)
    Effects: ¬At(Cargo, Airport) ∧ In(Cargo, Plane)
- Unload(Cargo, Plane)
    Preconditions: At(Robot, Airport) ∧ In(Cargo, Plane)
    Effects: ¬In(Cargo, Plane) ∧ At(Cargo, Airport)
