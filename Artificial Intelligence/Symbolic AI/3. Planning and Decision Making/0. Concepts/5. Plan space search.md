### Basic Idea
**Plan-space search involves building a partial plan using the following components:**

- Multiset O: A collection of operators {o1, ..., on}.
- Set <: Ordering constraints oi < oj, with transitivity built in.
- Set B: Binding constraints x = y, x ≠ y, x ∈ D, x ∉ D, representing substitutions.
- Set L: Causal links oi → oj, indicating that the effect p of oi establishes the precondition p of oj. The ordering constraints oi < oj and binding constraints in B apply to the parameters of oi and oj appearing in p.

These components collectively define the structure of the plan and the relationships between operators, constraints, and causal links.
