### Domain-independent heuristics

Domain-independent heuristics are heuristics that can be applied to any planning problem <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">without specific domain knowledge</mark>. These heuristics provide estimates of the cost or distance to the goal state from a given state, helping guide the search algorithm towards more promising paths.

These heuristics are called domain-independent because they <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">do not rely on specific knowledge about the domain</mark>, such as the structure of the planning operators or the specific goals. Instead, they provide general estimation techniques that can be applied to any planning problem. However, their effectiveness may vary depending on the characteristics of the problem and the quality of the heuristic function.


### Goal counting heuristic
This heuristic counts the number of goal propositions that are not yet achieved in the current state. <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">It assumes that each action will achieve at least one goal proposition and provides an estimate of the remaining distance to the goal</mark>.


### Relaxed planning graph heuristic
This heuristic constructs a relaxed version of the planning graph, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">where all delete effects of actions are ignored</mark>. It then estimates the cost to achieve the goal state in this relaxed graph, which provides a lower bound on the actual cost in the original problem. 


#### Delete Relaxation (h FF):
By <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">ignoring the delete effects</mark>, the planning algorithm considers that once a proposition is achieved, it remains true throughout the plan execution. This simplification allows the planner to focus on <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">achieving the positive effects and finding a sequence of actions that satisfies the goal conditions without explicitly handling the removal of unwanted propositions</mark>.

```python
function h_FF(current_state, goal_state):
    h = 0
    for each proposition in goal_state:
        if proposition not in current_state:
            h = h + 1
    return h
```


### Additive heuristic
This heuristic computes the sum of the costs of individual actions needed to achieve each goal proposition independently. It assumes that actions can be executed in any order and their costs can be summed up.


### h max and h sum heuristics
Relaxation is a common technique used in heuristic search to simplify the problem by ignoring certain aspects. The h max and h sum heuristics are two relaxation techniques often used in domain-independent planning.

#### h max heuristic
The h max heuristic is based on the idea of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">ignoring the negative effects</mark> of actions during the relaxation process. By considering only the positive effects of actions and ignoring any negative effects, the h max heuristic provides an optimistic estimate of the cost to reach the goal state from a given state. It assumes that all actions <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">will have positive outcomes and no obstacles or conflicts will be encountered along the way</mark>. While the h max heuristic can overestimate the actual cost, it tends to be more informed than simpler heuristics like h 0 (zero heuristic) which assumes no action has any effect.

```python 
# Initialization
for each proposition p:
    if p belongs to the current state s:
        H[p] = 0
    else:
        H[p] = infinity

# Fixed point iteration
while not converged:
    for each action a:
        H[a] = max(H[p] for p in Pre(a))
        for each proposition p in EFF+(a):
            H[p] = min(H[p], H[a] + cost(a))

# Calculate h_max heuristic
h_max = max(H[p] for p in goal_state)

# Return h_max value
return h_max
```


#### h sum heuristic
The h sum heuristic takes relaxation a step further by <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">ignoring the interactions between subgoals</mark>. In this heuristic, the problem is further simplified by considering each subgoal independently and summing up the estimated costs to achieve each subgoal. The h sum heuristic assumes that achieving each subgoal is independent of achieving the others and that there are <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">no conflicts or dependencies among the subgoals</mark>. This approach can be useful when the subgoals are loosely connected or when the interactions between them do not significantly affect the overall cost. However, it can lead to suboptimal estimates when there are strong interactions or dependencies between the subgoals.

Both the h max and h sum heuristics are quick to compute and can provide initial estimates for planning problems. However, they may not always accurately reflect the true cost of achieving the goal state due to the simplifications made during relaxation. To improve the effectiveness of these heuristics, domain-specific knowledge, advanced search techniques, abstraction, and pattern databases can be employed to tailor the heuristics to the problem at hand and provide more accurate estimates.


### Abstraction Heuristic

1.  Abstraction heuristics aim to simplify the search problem by abstracting away certain details of the state space, focusing on higher-level information that guides the search process.
    
2.  The main idea behind abstraction heuristics is to create an abstract representation of the problem by grouping states into abstract states or clusters. Each abstract state represents a set of concrete states that share some relevant properties or characteristics.
    
3.  Abstraction heuristics can be based on various techniques, such as state abstraction, goal abstraction, and action abstraction.
    
4.  State abstraction involves collapsing similar states together to create abstract states. This can be done by grouping states based on shared features or by clustering states based on similarity measures.
    
5.  Goal abstraction focuses on simplifying the goal information by considering high-level goal conditions or abstract goals that are easier to achieve. This can help in guiding the search towards the desired goal states.
    
6.  Action abstraction involves creating abstract actions that capture the essential properties of a group of similar concrete actions. These abstract actions can be used to guide the search process by considering the effects and preconditions at a higher level of abstraction.
    
7.  Abstraction heuristics can be used to estimate the heuristic value for search algorithms like A* or IDA*. The abstraction heuristics provide a more optimistic estimate of the remaining cost to reach the goal by considering the abstract state space.
    
8.  One challenge in using abstraction heuristics is finding the right level of abstraction that balances the trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency. Overly abstract representations may lead to underestimating the true cost, while overly detailed representations may result in high computational overhead.
    
9.  Abstraction heuristics can be domain-specific, where the abstraction is designed based on the specific characteristics of the problem domain, or they can be domain-independent, where general abstraction techniques are applied regardless of the problem domain.
    
10.  Abstraction heuristics can significantly improve the efficiency of search algorithms by reducing the search space and focusing on the most relevant aspects of the problem. However, the quality of the abstraction and its impact on the search performance depend on the specific problem and the design of the abstraction technique.

### Abstraction heuristics
Simplify the problem by ignoring parts of it. 

- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Drop preconditions</mark> from actions 
- Consider only a <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">subset of predicates/propositions</mark>
- Count objects with a given property, ignoring the identity of object s e.g. count clear blocks 
- Ignore so much that the abstract problem is small enough to be solve d by uninformed search 
- Use memory to avoid repeated searches (pattern databases)

### Landmark heuristics:

1.  Landmark heuristics are a type of domain-dependent heuristic used in planning and search algorithms. They leverage landmarks, which are specific states or actions that have <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">special significance in the problem domain</mark>.
    
2.  Landmarks are typically chosen based on their <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">relevance to the goal or their impact on the problem-solving process</mark>. They represent significant milestones or critical points in the problem space.
    
3.  Landmark heuristics work by identifying and exploiting landmarks to estimate the distance or cost from the current state to the goal state. They provide an optimistic estimate of the remaining effort required to reach the goal.
    
4.  There are two main types of landmark heuristics: <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">state landmarks and action landmarks</mark>.
    
5.  State landmarks focus on identifying states that are necessary for achieving the goal. These states act as landmarks because they must be reached or satisfied in order to reach the goal state. The heuristic estimate is based on the distance or cost to reach these state landmarks.
    
6.  Action landmarks, on the other hand, identify actions that have a significant impact on the problem-solving process. These actions are landmarks because they enable progress towards the goal state or lead to the satisfaction of critical state conditions. The heuristic estimate is based on the cost or number of actions required to reach these action landmarks.
    
7.  Landmark heuristics can be computed offline or online. Offline computation involves precomputing and storing landmarks before the search process begins. Online computation involves dynamically identifying landmarks during the search based on the current state and goal information.
    
8.  Landmark heuristics can significantly improve the efficiency of planning and search algorithms by providing informed guidance towards the goal state. They exploit the structural and causal knowledge of the problem domain to estimate the remaining effort.
    
9.  However, landmark heuristics are dependent on the quality of landmark selection and the coverage of the identified landmarks. If important landmarks are missed or the chosen landmarks are not sufficiently relevant, the heuristic estimate may be inaccurate or suboptimal.
    
10.  Landmark heuristics are widely used in various planning algorithms, such as FF, LAMA, and FF-Replan. They have been shown to be effective in reducing the search space and improving the efficiency of planning processes.
