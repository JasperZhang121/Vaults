### Relevance
In planning, an action `a` is considered relevant for a goal `g` if it satisfies the following conditions:

1. **Positive Effect**: The action `a` must make at least one of the propositions in `g` true. In other words, the intersection between the positive effects of `a` (eff+(a)) and `g` should not be an empty set ($$g ∩ eff^+(a) ≠ \emptyset$$)
2. **Negative Effect**: The action `a` must not make any of the propositions in `g` false. The intersection between the negative effects of `a` (eff-(a)) and `g` should be an empty set $$(g ∩ eff^-(a) = \emptyset$$).

If an action `a` is relevant for a goal `g`, the regression operator γ-1(g, a) is defined as follows:

$$\gamma^{-1}(g, a) = (g \backslash \text{eff}^+(a)) \cup \text{pre}(a)$$
This means that the resulting state after applying action `a` to the goal `g` is obtained by removing the positive effects of `a` from `g` and adding the preconditions of `a` to the resulting state.

By identifying the relevant actions for a goal, planners can <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">focus on the actions that directly contribute to achieving the goal</mark> and avoid considering irrelevant actions. This relevance analysis helps streamline the planning process and improve the efficiency of finding a solution.
