Classical planning is a branch of AI concerned with developing agents that can make a sequence of decisions to achieve a goal. It involves constructing a plan, a sequence of actions that will achieve a particular goal or set of goals. The plan is executed in the environment, and the agent observes the resulting state of the environment and updates its plan accordingly.


## Problem Formulation
Classical planning is typically formulated as a search problem, where the goal is to <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">find a sequence of actions that will transform the initial state into a goal state</mark>. The problem can be defined as a tuple (S, A, T, I, G), where:
-   S is a set of states
-   A is a set of actions
-   T is a transition function that maps a state and an action to a new state: $S * A |=> S$
-   I is the initial state
-   G is the set of goal states
-   C is the cost function 
Note: if action a is not applicable in state s then T(s,a) is undefined

As a result, given the planning model (S,A,T,I,G,C), finding a sequence of actions <a1,a2,a3 ... > leading to the environment from I to G in min cost.

### Linear plan
A sequence of actions that take the initial state of the planning problem to the goal state. Each <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">action in the plan is executed sequentially</mark> and the effects of the previous action become the preconditions of the next action. A linear plan can be obtained through search algorithms such as depth-first search, breadth-first search, or A* search, where the goal is to find a sequence of actions that leads from the initial state to the goal state. Once a linear plan is found, it can be executed to achieve the goal. However, in some cases, there may be multiple linear plans that achieve the same goal, and it is up to the planner to choose the most appropriate one based on various factors such as efficiency, safety, and cost.

  
### Non-linear plan

A plan that contains <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">conditional or looping constructs</mark>, which allow for more complex and flexible planning than linear plans. They can include if-then statements, loops, and other control structures that allow the planner to change its course of action based on the state of the environment or the outcome of actions.

For example, consider a robot trying to navigate through a maze. A non-linear plan for the robot might include the following steps:

1.  If the robot is at a dead end, turn around and go back the way it came.
2.  Otherwise, if there is an open passage to the left, turn left and move forward.
3.  Otherwise, if there is an open passage straight ahead, move forward.
4.  Otherwise, if there is an open passage to the right, turn right and move forward.
5.  Otherwise, the robot is stuck and cannot proceed.

In this plan, the robot <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">uses conditional statements to decide which direction to move in based on the available passages</mark>. This allows for a more flexible and adaptive planning approach that can handle a variety of different maze layouts and obstacles.

Non-linear plans are typically represented as <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">decision trees</mark> or flowcharts that show the different possible paths through the plan based on the current state and the outcomes of previous actions. They can be more complex to generate and execute than linear plans, but they offer greater flexibility and adaptability in dynamic and uncertain environments.

### Parallel plan

A plan that allows for <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">multiple actions to be executed simultaneously or in a concurrent fashion</mark>. In other words, the actions in a parallel plan can be executed independently of each other, without any ordering constraints. This is in contrast to a sequential plan, where the actions must be executed in a specific order.

Parallel plans are useful in situations where there are multiple agents or resources available to execute actions simultaneously. For example, in a manufacturing plant, multiple machines could be used in parallel to produce different parts of a product simultaneously.

One approach to generating parallel plans is to use <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">partial-order planning</mark>, where the order of some actions is left unspecified, allowing for multiple actions to be executed in parallel. Another approach is to use temporal planning, which allows for the specification of temporal constraints between actions, such as start and end times, and can be used to generate plans that take advantage of parallelism.
