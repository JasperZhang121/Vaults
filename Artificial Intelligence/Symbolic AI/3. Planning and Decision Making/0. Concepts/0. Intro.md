***Planner = solver over a class of problem*** 

Planning and decision-making are fundamental tasks in Artificial Intelligence, which involve selecting actions to achieve a desired goal or maximize some utility function. Planning involves reasoning about future events and determining the sequence of actions required to achieve a goal, while decision-making involves selecting the best action to take in a given situation.

### Classical Planning Assumptions
  
1.  **Fully observable environment**: The planner has<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> complete knowledge about the current state of the environment and can fully observe the effects of actions</mark>. There are no hidden or partially observable states.
    
2.  **Deterministic environment**: The outcome of an action is deterministic and known in advance. There is no randomness or uncertainty in the environment.
    
3.  **Static environment**: The environment does not change while the planner is executing the plan. There are <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">no external factors that can influence the environment</mark>.
    
4.  **Finite set of actions**: The planner has a <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">finite set of actions</mark> to choose from, and the set of actions does not change over time.
    
5.  **Discrete time**: The planner operates in discrete time steps, where the duration of an action is assumed to be negligible compared to the time steps.
    
6.  **Perfect execution**: The planner assumes that the actions are executed perfectly, without any errors or failures.
 
7.  **Sequential**: Solution is a  seqence of actions


### Planning in Symbolic AI

Planning in Symbolic AI involves representing the world in terms of logical propositions and reasoning about the effects of actions. A planner uses a domain model to determine the preconditions and effects of each action, and a search algorithm to find a sequence of actions that achieves the goal.

Some popular planning algorithms in Symbolic AI include:

-   **STRIPS** (Stanford Research Institute Problem Solver): a classical planner that uses a forward search to find a sequence of actions that achieves the goal.
-   **Graphplan**: a planner that uses a backward search and a graph-based representation of the planning problem to generate a plan.
-   **SATPLAN**: a planner that converts the planning problem into a propositional satisfiability problem and uses a SAT solver to find a plan.

### Decision Making in Symbolic AI

Decision-making in Symbolic AI involves representing the world in terms of logical propositions and reasoning about the expected outcomes of different actions. A decision maker uses a utility function to evaluate the desirability of different outcomes, and selects the action that maximizes the expected utility.

Some popular decision-making algorithms in Symbolic AI include:

-   **Value iteration**: an algorithm for finding the optimal policy for a Markov decision process (MDP) by iteratively computing the optimal value function.
-   **Policy iteration**: an algorithm for finding the optimal policy for an MDP by iteratively improving an initial policy.
-   **Q-learning**: a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that learns the optimal policy by estimating the Q-value function.

### Applications of Planning and Decision Making in Symbolic AI

Planning and decision-making algorithms have a wide range of applications in Symbolic AI, including:

-   Robotics: planning and decision-making algorithms are used to control the actions of robots and autonomous systems.
-   Logistics: planning algorithms are used to optimize the scheduling and routing of resources in transportation and supply chain management.
-   Game AI: decision-making algorithms are used to create intelligent agents in games and simulations.
-   Natural language processing: planning and decision-making algorithms are used to generate coherent and fluent natural language texts.
