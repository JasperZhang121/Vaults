A constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) is a computational problem that involves finding a solution to a set of constraints that restrict the possible values of variables in a problem domain. The goal of a CSP is to <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">find a valid assignment of values to variables that satisfies all the constraints</mark>. CSPs are used in a variety of fields, such as artificial intelligence, operations research, and computer science. Some examples of CSPs include scheduling problems, routing problems, and puzzle-solving problems like Sudoku.

### Steps involved in CSP search:

1.  Initialization: Start by initializing the variables and their domains. Variables are the entities that need to be assigned values, while the domains are the set of possible values that can be assigned to each variable.
    
2.  Constraint propagation: After initializing the variables and domains, perform constraint propagation to eliminate values from the domains that cannot satisfy the constraints. This is done by applying various techniques such as forward checking, arc consistency, and constraint propagation.
    
3.  Variable selection: Select a variable that has not been assigned a value yet. This variable should have the smallest domain (minimum remaining values) to minimize the branching factor of the search tree.
    
4.  Value selection: Select a value from the domain of the selected variable. This value should be consistent with the current assignment and should not violate any constraints.
    
5.  Backtracking: If a value cannot be assigned to the selected variable, backtrack to the previous variable and try a different value. If there are no more values to try for a variable, backtrack further to the previous variable until a valid assignment is found or all possible combinations of values have been tried.
    
6.  Solution checking: After assigning values to all variables, check if the solution satisfies all constraints. If not, backtrack and try a different combination of values.
    
7.  Solution output: If a valid solution is found, output the solution. If not, output that the problem is unsolvable.

### Backtracking

Simple backtracking:

```java
function pureBacktracking(csp):
    return backtrack({}, csp)

function backtrack(assignment, csp):
    if assignment is complete:
        return assignment
    var = selectUnassignedVariable(csp, assignment)
    for value in orderDomainValues(var, assignment, csp):
        if isConsistent(var, value, assignment, csp):
            assignment[var] = value
            inferences = inference(var, value, assignment, csp)
            if inferences is not failure:
                assignment = assignment + inferences
                result = backtrack(assignment, csp)
                if result is not failure:
                    return result
            del assignment[var]
            undoInferences(inferences, assignment, csp)
    return failure
```

### Value ordering

A technique used in constraint satisfaction problems to decide the order in which values are assigned to variables. The idea is to choose a variable and assign it a value from its domain that has the highest likelihood of leading to a solution, or the lowest likelihood of leading to a dead-end.

There are many methods for value ordering, including:

1.  Minimum Remaining Values (MRV): This heuristic selects the variable with the <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">fewest remaining values in its domain</mark>, which is likely to lead to a quick resolution of the constraint.
    
2.  Least Constraining Value (LCV): This heuristic chooses the value that <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">rules out the fewest choices for neighboring variables</mark>, which is likely to increase the chance of finding a solution in the long run.
    
3.  Degree Heuristic: This heuristic selects the variable that has the most constraints on remaining variables, which is likely to help prune the search space more quickly.
    
4.  Random Value: This heuristic selects a value at random from the domain of the variable.
    

These methods can be used alone or in combination with each other to improve the efficiency of the backtracking algorithm.

### Forward Checking:

Backtracking with inference (also known as backtracking with forward checking) is an algorithm used to solve constraint satisfaction problems. The basic idea behind the algorithm is to use backtracking search to explore the space of possible solutions, but to make use of inference to reduce the size of the search space whenever possible.

The algorithm works by maintaining a set of domains, one for each variable in the problem. At the beginning, each domain contains all possible values for the corresponding variable. As the algorithm proceeds, it selects a variable to assign a value to and removes all other values from its domain. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Then, the algorithm performs inference to propagate the constraints that have been violated by this assignment to other variables, and updates their domains accordingly</mark>.

If a variable's <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">domain becomes empty</mark>, the algorithm <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">backtracks</mark> to the most recently assigned variable and tries a different value. In this way, the algorithm systematically explores the space of possible solutions until a solution is found or all possible combinations of variable assignments have been exhausted.

```python
function forward_checking(var, assignment, gamma):
    pruned_list = create empty list
    neighbours = get the set of neighbours of var in gamma

    for neighbour in neighbours:
        if neighbour is not assigned:
            constraints = get the set of constraints between var and neighbour in gamma

            if constraints is empty:
                continue

            count_removal = 0
            for value in the domain of neighbour in gamma:
                if value is in constraints:
                    add (neighbour, value) to pruned_list
                    increment count_removal by 1

            if count_removal is equal to the length of the domain of neighbour in gamma:
                return None

    return pruned_list
```

### Arc Consistency

Arc consistency is a property of constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) where every value in a variable's domain is consistent with every value in the domains of its neighbors, given the constraints between them. This means that for every pair of variables (X, Y) connected by a constraint, if a value in X's domain is incompatible with every possible value of Y, then that value is removed from X's domain. This process is repeated for all variables until no values can be removed. The resulting CSP is said to be arc consistent. Arc consistency is an important property for efficient constraint satisfaction algorithms.

Arc consistency is a technique used in constraint satisfaction problems to reduce the domain of variables to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">make backtracking more efficient</mark>. It involves examining pairs of variables and checking if one can be eliminated from the other's domain. If a variable's domain is reduced, it can help to<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;"> prune the search tree and avoid unnecessary backtracking</mark>.
Arc consistency can be achieved through the use of<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> a queue that stores pairs</mark> of variables to be checked. This process can be repeated <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">until no more variables can be removed from any domains</mark>, or until all domains are reduced to a single value. Once arc consistency is achieved, backtracking with forward checking or other inference techniques can be applied to solve the CSP efficiently.

```python
domains = {
    'A': [1, 2, 3],
    'B': [1, 2, 3],
    'C': [1, 2, 3]
}

constraints = {
    ('A', 'B'): lambda a, b: a > b,
    ('B', 'A'): lambda b, a: b < a,
    ('B', 'C'): lambda b, c: b == c,
    ('C', 'B'): lambda c, b: c == b,
}
