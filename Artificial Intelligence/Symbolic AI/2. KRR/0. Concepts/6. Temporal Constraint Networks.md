Temporal Constraint Networks (TCN) are a class of <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">constraint satisfaction problem</mark>s where the variables represent time points and the constraints represent temporal relationships between the variables. TCNs are used to model and reason about temporal dependencies in a variety of fields, such as planning, scheduling, and resource allocation.

In TCNs, <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">each variable</mark> represents <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">a time point and the domain of each variable consists of all possible time values</mark>. The constraints in a TCN specify temporal relationships between the variables, such as temporal precedence, duration, and resource usage. These constraints can be either soft or hard, depending on the problem being modeled.

A TCN can be represented as a <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">graph</mark>, where the <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">nodes represent the variables (time points) and the edges represent the temporal constraints between the nodes</mark>. The constraints can be represented as functions or relations that map a set of time points to a set of valid temporal values.

Solving a TCN involves finding a consistent assignment of time points to the variables that satisfies all of the constraints. This can be done using various algorithms, such as backtracking search and local search, with various heuristics and pruning techniques.

### Temporal constraints

In Temporal Constraint Networks (TCNs), temporal constraints are used to represent relationships between temporal variables. These constraints can be transitive, meaning if there is a constraint between variables A and B, and a constraint between variables B and C, then there is an implicit constraint between variables A and C. However, some temporal constraints may not be transitive, and can exhibit asymmetry, meaning if there is a constraint between variables A and B, there may not be a constraint between variables B and A.

For example, consider the constraint "Task A must be completed before Task B can begin." This constraint is transitive, as it implies that if Task B must be completed before Task C can begin, then Task A must also be completed before Task C can begin. However, this constraint is also asymmetric, as it implies that if Task B must be completed before Task A can begin, then Task A does not need to be completed before Task C can begin.

### Solving

1.  Backtracking: This algorithm involves systematically searching through the space of possible solutions, backtracking when an inconsistency or dead-end is encountered. It involves a depth-first search of the solution space and is guided by a variable ordering heuristic, value ordering heuristic, and consistency checking.
    
2.  Constraint Propagation: This algorithm involves iteratively applying constraints to variables until no more constraints can be applied. It involves establishing arc consistency between pairs of variables, enforcing generalized arc consistency, or propagating time intervals.
    
3.  Local Search: This algorithm involves iteratively improving a candidate solution by modifying a small subset of variables at each step. It involves defining a neighborhood of candidate solutions, moving to a neighboring solution, and accepting or rejecting the new solution based on an acceptance criterion.
    
4.  Mixed Integer Programming (MIP): This algorithm involves formulating the TCN problem as a mixed-integer programming problem and solving it using an off-the-shelf MIP solver. It involves defining decision variables, objective function, and constraints, then using branch-and-bound, branch-and-cut, or column generation techniques to find an optimal solution.
    
5.  Petri Nets: This algorithm involves modeling the TCN problem as a Petri Net and analyzing its properties. It involves defining transitions, places, arcs, and markings, then simulating the behavior of the Petri Net to find a feasible or optimal solution.
