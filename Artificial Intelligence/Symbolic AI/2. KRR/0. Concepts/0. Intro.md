Knowledge representation and reasoning (KRR) in Symbolic AI refers to the process of representing and manipulating knowledge in a way that is suitable for <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">automated reasoning</mark>. The goal of KRR is to create a formal representation of the world that can be used to reason about complex problems and make decisions.

Symbolic AI approaches KRR by representing knowledge using symbols, such as logical propositions or rules, and manipulating those symbols using logical inference rules to derive new knowledge. This allows for a more structured and systematic way of reasoning than other AI approaches, such as machine learning, which rely on statistical patterns in data.

Some common methods used in KRR include:

-   Propositional logic: a formal language for representing and manipulating logical propositions. Check:[[1. Propositional Logic]]
	-   First-order logic: an extension of propositional logic that includes variables, quantifiers, and functions, allowing for more complex representations of knowledge. Check: [[2. First Order Logic]]
-   Description logics: a family of logic-based knowledge representation languages that are particularly useful for representing knowledge about objects and their properties.
-   Rule-based systems: a way of representing knowledge in the form of production rules, which specify how to infer new knowledge from existing knowledge.

KRR has many applications in areas such as natural language processing, expert systems, and intelligent agents. By representing and reasoning about knowledge in a structured and systematic way, KRR provides a powerful tool for automated decision-making and problem-solving in complex domains.

### Knowledge-based agents

-   A knowledge-based agent uses an internal representation of the world to reason and make decisions.
-   The internal representation is called a knowledge base (KB), and it contains information about the agent's environment, including the agent's goals, beliefs, and assumptions.
-   The agent uses <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">inference rules to draw conclusions from the information in the KB</mark>. Inference is the process of deriving new information from existing information.
-   The agent's <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">KB can be updated as new information becomes available</mark> or as the agent's beliefs change.
-   The KB can be represented using different formalisms, such as propositional logic, first-order logic, or semantic networks.
-   The agent's decision-making process involves selecting actions that are expected to achieve the agent's goals based on the current state of the KB and the agent's beliefs.
-   Knowledge-based agents can be used in a wide range of applications, including expert systems, natural language processing, robotics, and intelligent tutoring systems.

```python
function KB-Agent(percept):
	persistent: KB, a knowledge base t, a counter, initially 0, indicating time
		
	KB ← Tell(KB, Make-Percept-Sentence(percept))
    action ← Ask(KB, Make-Action-Query())
    KB ← Tell(KB, Make-Action-Sentence(action))
    t = t + 1
    return action
```

```python
def simple_kb_agent():
    # initialize the knowledge base with some initial facts
    knowledge_base = ["A is true", "B is false"]
    
    while True:
        # observe the environment
        percept = observe_environment()
        
        # update the knowledge base based on the percept
        knowledge_base = update_kb(knowledge_base, percept)
        
        # choose an action based on the current state of the knowledge base
        action = choose_action(knowledge_base)
        
        # perform the action in the environment
        perform_action(action)
```

### Wumpus World 

```
|---|---|---|---|
| G |   | W |   |
|---|---|---|---|
| P | W |   | P |
|---|---|---|---|
|   |   | P |   |
|---|---|---|---|
|   | W |   | G |
|---|---|---|---|
```

-   Performance measure: A quantitative measure of the agent's success in achieving its goal, which is to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">find the gold and exit the environment while avoiding the Wumpus and pits</mark>. The agent receives +1000 for achieving the goal, -1000 for being eaten by the Wumpus or falling into a pit, and -1 for each action taken.
-   Environment: The Wumpus World is a 2D grid where the agent can move to adjacent squares, pick up gold, shoot arrows to kill the Wumpus, and perceive its surroundings. The environment contains the agent, the gold, the Wumpus, pits, and walls.
-   Actuators: The agent can move forward, turn left or right, pick up the gold, shoot an arrow in the current direction, and grab the gold if it is adjacent. The agent also receives feedback when it bumps into a wall or when the arrow hits something.
-   Sensors: The agent can perceive whether there is a wall, a pit, the gold, or the Wumpus in the adjacent squares. The agent also senses a scream when the Wumpus is killed by an arrow.

```python
function wumpusExplore():
    // initialize the knowledge base
    KB = initializeKB()

    // initialize the agent's position and direction
    agentPos = [1, 1]
    agentDir = "right"

    // move forward until a wall is reached
    while true:
        // check for stench, breeze, and glitter
        percept = getPercept(agentPos)

        // update the knowledge base with the percept
        KB = updateKB(KB, percept)

        // if there is a glitter, grab the gold and return
        if percept.hasGlitter:
            grabGold()
            return

        // if there is no danger, move forward
        if not percept.hasBreeze and not percept.hasStench:
            moveForward(agentPos, agentDir)

        // if there is a breeze or stench, shoot the arrow or change direction
        else:
            if percept.hasBreeze:
                shootArrow(agentDir, agentPos, KB)
            if percept.hasStench:
                agentDir = changeDirection(agentDir)

        // if the agent falls into a pit or is eaten by the wumpus, return
        if agentPos == [0, 0]:
            return
        if KB.hasWumpus or KB.hasPit:
            return
```

```python
def wumpus_explore():
def wumpus_explore():
    # initialize the knowledge base
    KB = initialize_kb()

    # initialize the agent's position and direction
    agent_pos = [1, 1]
    agent_dir = "right"

    # move forward until a wall is reached
    while True:
        # check for stench, breeze, and glitter
        percept = get_percept(agent_pos)

        # update the knowledge base with the percept
        KB = update_KB(KB, percept)

        # if there is a glitter, grab the gold and return
        if percept.has_glitter:
            grab_gold()
            return

        # if there is no danger, move forward
        if not percept.has_breeze and not percept.has_stench:
            move_forward(agent_pos, agent_dir)

        # if there is a breeze or stench, shoot the arrow or change direction
        else:
            if percept.has_breeze:
                shoot_arrow(agent_dir, agent_pos, KB)
            if percept.has_stench:
                agent_dir = change_direction(agent_dir)

        # if the agent falls into a pit or is eaten by the wumpus, return
        if agent_pos == [0, 0]:
            return
        if KB.has_wumpus or KB.has_pit:
            return

### Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR)

- KRR is a subfield of AI that focuses on how <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">knowledge can be represented, manipulated, and used to reason about the world</mark>.

- The goal of KRR is to develop formalisms that enable knowledge to be expressed in a way that can be understood and processed by computers.

- KRR plays an important role in various AI applications, such as expert systems, natural language processing, and intelligent agents.

#### SAT

- SAT stands for <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">propositional satisfiability</mark>, which is a classic problem in computer science that involves determining whether a given Boolean formula can be made true by assigning values to its variables.

- SAT is a central problem in many areas of computer science, including logic, complexity theory, and artificial intelligence.

- SAT solvers are widely used in many applications, such as software verification, automated planning, and electronic design automation.

**However:**
The <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">brute force</mark> method of trying all possible combinations quickly becomes <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">infeasible</mark> for large SAT problems. This is why more efficient algorithms like DPLL and CDCL are used instead.


### Example of using KRR and SAT in AI:

Consider a simple knowledge base about animals:

-   A dog is a mammal.
-   A cat is a mammal.
-   A bird is not a mammal.
-   A mammal has fur.

We can represent this <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">knowledge base</mark> using first-order logic and predicates. For example, we can define the following predicates:

-   mammal(x): x is a mammal
-   dog(x): x is a dog
-   cat(x): x is a cat
-   bird(x): x is a bird
-   fur(x): x has fur

Using these predicates, we can represent the knowledge base as follows:

-   ∀x (dog(x) → mammal(x))
-   ∀x (cat(x) → mammal(x))
-   ∀x (bird(x) → ¬mammal(x))
-   ∀x (mammal(x) → fur(x))

We can use a KRR system to reason about this knowledge base. For example, we can use inference rules to derive new knowledge. One inference rule is modus ponens, which states that if we know "p → q" and "p", then we can infer "q". Using modus ponens, we can infer that a dog has fur:

-   "dog(x) → mammal(x)" and "dog(fido)" imply "mammal(fido)"
-   "mammal(fido) → fur(fido)" implies "fur(fido)"

We can also use a SAT solver to check if a given statement is entailed by the knowledge base. For example, we can ask whether a bird has fur. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">To do this, we can negate the statement "bird(x) → fur(x)" and check if it is satisfiable. If it is unsatisfiable, then the statement is entailed by the knowledge base. If it is satisfiable, then the statement is not entailed by the knowledge base. In this case, negating the statement gives us "bird(x) ∧ ¬fur(x)", which is satisfiable</mark>. Therefore, we can conclude that a bird does not have fur.

### Conjunction Normal Form (CNF) 

A form of propositional logic where a formula is expressed as a conjunction (AND) of one or more clauses, where each clause is a disjunction (OR) of one or more literals. A literal is either a propositional variable or its negation.

For example, the formula (p OR q) AND (NOT p OR r) AND (NOT q OR NOT r) is in CNF form, where each clause is a disjunction of literals and the whole formula is a conjunction of these clauses.

CNF is an important form of propositional logic because <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">any propositional formula can be converted to an equivalent formula in CNF</mark>. This makes it useful for automated theorem proving, model checking, and other applications of propositional logic.

**Equivalent formulas:**

-   ¬(p ∧ q) ≡ ¬p ∨ ¬q
-   ¬(p ∨ q) ≡ ¬p ∧ ¬q
-   (p ∧ q) ∨ r ≡ (p ∨ r) ∧ (q ∨ r)
-   (p ∨ q) ∧ r ≡ (p ∧ r) ∨ (q ∧ r)
-   ¬¬p ≡ p
-   p ∨ (q ∧ r) ≡ (p ∨ q) ∧ (p ∨ r)
-   p ∧ (q ∨ r) ≡ (p ∧ q) ∨ (p ∧ r)
-   p → q ≡ ¬p ∨ q

Summary:

A clause is a disjunction of literals (e.g. a or b or c), and a formula in CNF is a conjunction of clauses (e.g. (a or b) and (not a or c) and (not c or d)). 

The conversion of a propositional logic statement to CNF involves several steps:

1. Eliminate implications by replacing any occurrence of A => B with (not A) or B.
2. Use De Morgan's laws and double negation elimination to push negations inward and eliminate double negations.
3. Distribute disjunctions over conjunctions using the distributive law.
4. Convert any remaining compound propositions to clauses.

Once a statement is in CNF, it can be used in various logical algorithms, such as DPLL and resolution, to determine its satisfiability.

### Resolution

a logical inference rule used in automated theorem proving and propositional logic. It involves taking <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">two clauses</mark>, where each clause is a disjunction of literals, and resolving them by finding a pair of complementary literals (i.e., one positive and one negative) that can be eliminated from the clauses. The result of the resolution is <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">a new clause that is the disjunction of the remaining literals</mark> from both original clauses. If the new clause contains a contradiction, such as a literal and its negation, then the original clauses are said to be unsatisfiable. If no such contradiction is found, then the process can be repeated with other pairs of clauses until no more resolutions are possible. If an empty clause is ever produced, the resolution process is terminated and the original set of clauses is determined to be unsatisfiable.

The <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">general form</mark> of resolution can be described as follows:

Given two clauses C1 and C2, if they share a complementary literal (i.e., a literal and its negation), then a new clause C can be derived by resolving C1 and C2, which consists of the union of all literals from C1 and C2 except for the complementary literals. For example:

$$\frac{P \vee Q, \neg P \vee R}{Q \vee R}$$

In this example, the complementary literals are P(x) and ¬P(x), and the resolvent is Q(x) ∨ R(x).

Resolution can be used to prove that a set of clauses is unsatisfiable by repeatedly applying the resolution rule until either an empty clause is derived, indicating that the set is unsatisfiable, or no new clauses can be derived.
