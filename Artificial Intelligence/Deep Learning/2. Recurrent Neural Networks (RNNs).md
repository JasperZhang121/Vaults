RNNs are a type of neural network that are particularly well-suited for modeling sequences of data, such as time series data or natural language text. RNNs are designed to handle input sequences of variable length and are able to capture temporal dependencies between elements of a sequence.

### Architecture

The key feature of an RNN is the recurrent connection between hidden units. The output of each hidden unit is a function of the input at the current time step and the output of the previous hidden unit. This allows the network to maintain a state or memory that is updated over time as new inputs are processed.

RNNs can be visualized as a sequence of repeating modules, where each module takes an input and produces an output as well as an updated hidden state. The output of each module can be used to make a prediction or to update the hidden state of the next module in the sequence.

### Training

RNNs are trained using backpropagation through time (BPTT), which is an extension of standard backpropagation that takes into account the temporal dependencies in the sequence. During training, the weights of the network are adjusted to minimize a loss function that measures the discrepancy between the predicted output and the true output at each time step.

### Applications

RNNs have been used in a variety of applications, including language modeling, speech recognition, machine translation, and video analysis. One popular type of RNN is the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, which is designed to address the problem of vanishing gradients in standard RNNs.

### Limitations

Despite their strengths, RNNs can be difficult to train and are prone to overfitting, especially when dealing with long sequences. In addition, RNNs can be slow to train and require large amounts of data to achieve good performance.
