Transfer learning is a technique in machine learning where a <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">pre-trained model</mark> is used as a starting point for training a new model on a different but related task. Transfer learning can significantly reduce the amount of data and computation required to train a new model, and can improve the performance of the new model by leveraging knowledge learned from the pre-trained model.

### Architecture

Transfer learning can be achieved using a variety of architectures, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification tasks and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for natural language processing tasks. In transfer learning, the pre-trained model is often referred to as the "base model" and the new model as the "head model". The base model can be frozen or fine-tuned during training, depending on the specific task.

### Training

Transfer learning involves <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">two stages of training</mark>. In the first stage, the pre-trained model is trained on <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">a large dataset of labeled examples</mark>. In the second stage, the head model is trained on <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">a smaller dataset of labeled examples for the new task</mark>, with the weights of the base model either frozen or fine-tuned. Fine-tuning involves adjusting the weights of the base model to better fit the new task, while freezing the weights involves keeping the weights fixed and only training the head model.

### Application

Transfer learning has been successfully applied in a variety of domains, including computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition. Transfer learning can be used to improve the performance of a model on a specific task, such as image classification or sentiment analysis, by leveraging the knowledge learned from a pre-trained model.

### Limitation

The success of transfer learning depends on the similarity of the pre-trained and new tasks. If the tasks are <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">too dissimilar, the pre-trained model may not provide much benefit</mark>. In addition, transfer learning can also suffer from the problem of catastrophic forgetting, where the pre-trained knowledge may be lost when fine-tuning the base model for a new task.
