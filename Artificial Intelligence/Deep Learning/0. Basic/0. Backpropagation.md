Backpropagation is a widely used algorithm for training neural networks. It is an efficient method to <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">calculate the gradient of the loss function</mark> with respect to the weights of the network.

The backpropagation algorithm is based on the<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;"> chain rule of calculus</mark>, which allows the calculation of the derivative of a composite function. In the context of neural networks, the composite function is the network itself, which consists of multiple layers of neurons.

The backpropagation algorithm starts by calculating the output of the neural network for a given input. This output is compared to the desired output, and the <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">difference between the two is used to calculate the loss function</mark>. The goal of backpropagation is to minimize this loss function by adjusting the weights of the network.

To do this, backpropagation computes the <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights of the network</mark>. This is done by applying the chain rule of calculus to calculate the partial derivatives of the loss function with respect to the weights in each layer of the network.

The backpropagation algorithm is typically applied to a feedforward neural network, which consists of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each neuron in the network applies a weighted sum of its inputs, followed by a nonlinear activation function. The output of each neuron is then passed to the next layer of neurons.

The backpropagation algorithm proceeds in two phases:

1.  Forward Propagation: In this phase, the input data is fed forward through the network, and the output of each neuron is computed based on its weighted sum and activation function.
    
2.  Backward Propagation: In this phase, the error is propagated backwards through the network. The gradient of the loss function is calculated with respect to the output of each neuron, and then recursively with respect to the inputs and weights of each neuron in the network. The gradient is then used to update the weights of the network to minimize the loss function.


The backpropagation algorithm is often used in combination with gradient descent to optimize the weights of the network. The gradient descent algorithm uses the gradient calculated by backpropagation to update the weights in the direction that minimizes the loss function.

The backpropagation algorithm can be summarized by the following formula:

$\dfrac{\partial L}{\partial w_{ij}} = \dfrac{\partial o_j}{\partial net_j} \cdot \dfrac{\partial L}{\partial o_j} \cdot \dfrac{\partial net_j}{\partial w_{ij}}$


where:

-   L is the loss function
-   $w_{ij}$ is the weight of the connection between neuron i and neuron j
-   $o_j$ is the output of neuron j
-   $net_j$ is the weighted sum of the inputs to neuron j
-   $\frac{\partial L}{\partial w_{ij}}$ is the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weight $w_{ij}$.

The backpropagation algorithm is a powerful tool for training neural networks, and has been instrumental in the success of deep learning.

### Sigmoid Activation Function

Sure! Here are some notes on the sigmoid activation function:

The sigmoid activation function is a commonly used non-linear activation function in neural networks. It is a type of "squashing" function that <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">maps any input value to a value between 0 and 1</mark>. The formula for the sigmoid function is:

$$\sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}$$

where $z$ is the input to the function. When the input is very large (positive or negative), the sigmoid function saturates, meaning the output becomes close to 1 or 0, respectively. This means that the function is able to "squash" large inputs to a manageable range.

Sigmoid functions are used in neural networks for a variety of purposes, including as activation functions in hidden layers and as the final activation function in binary classification tasks (where the output of the network should be a probability between 0 and 1). The derivative of the sigmoid function is also relatively simple, which makes it easy to compute during backpropagation.

However, sigmoid functions have some limitations. One of the main issues is that they suffer from the "vanishing gradient" problem, which occurs when the gradient of the sigmoid function becomes very small as the input becomes very large (in the positive or negative direction). This can make it difficult for the network to learn long-term dependencies, as the gradient becomes too small to propagate effectively through the network.

As a result, sigmoid functions are often used in combination with other activation functions, such as the rectified linear unit (ReLU) or the hyperbolic tangent (tanh) function. These functions can help to alleviate the vanishing gradient problem while still providing the non-linearity required for effective neural network modeling.

Extra:

Neural networks are often used for classification tasks, where the goal is to predict a binary or multi-class label for a given input. To make these predictions, the network typically outputs a vector of scores or probabilities for each possible class.

By using an activation function that maps the network's raw output to a value between 0 and 1, such as the sigmoid function, we can interpret these scores as probabilities. Specifically, the output for each class can be interpreted as the probability that the input belongs to that class.

This allows us to use probabilistic decision rules, such as choosing the class with the highest probability (i.e., the maximum likelihood estimate), or using a threshold to make a binary classification decision. It also provides a natural way to evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy or cross-entropy loss.

Furthermore, using an activation function that maps the output to a bounded range can help prevent the network from producing very large or very small values that can cause numerical instability during training or prediction. The sigmoid function in particular has the property of saturating at the extremes, which can help prevent the network from making overly confident or confident but incorrect predictions.
