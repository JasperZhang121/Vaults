The Decoder in the Transformer model is responsible for generating the output sequence based on the continuous representations provided by the Encoder. Similar to the Encoder, the Decoder is also composed of a stack of identical layers, but with three sub-layers: a masked multi-head self-attention mechanism, a multi-head attention mechanism over the encoder's output, and a position-wise fully connected feed-forward network.

1. **Components of the Decoder:**
    
    A. **Masked Multi-head Self-Attention Mechanism:** The first sub-layer in each decoder layer is a self-attention mechanism that works almost identically to the one in the encoder. However, it has an additional feature: masking. The purpose of this masking is to prevent each token in the output sequence from attending to subsequent tokens in the output sequence, ensuring that the prediction for a particular step does not depend on any future steps.
    
    B. **Multi-head Attention over Encoder's Output:** The second sub-layer is a multi-head attention mechanism where the queries come from the previous decoder layer, and the keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every position in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence, incorporating information from the input sequence into the output sequence.
    
    C. **Position-wise Fully Connected Feed-Forward Network:** Similar to the encoder, the decoder also contains a position-wise fully connected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically.
    
    D. **Add & Norm (Residual Connection and Layer Normalization):** The Transformer also adds a residual connection and applies layer normalization after each of the three sub-layers in the decoder, just as in the encoder.
    
2. **Working Together of the Components:**
    
    The masked multi-head self-attention mechanism works similarly to the self-attention mechanism in the encoder, but with the added masking to prevent future information flow. This mechanism allows each token in the output sequence to interact with all other tokens in the output sequence up to and including that position.
    
    In the multi-head attention over the encoder's output, the attention scores are calculated using the query vectors from the output of the previous decoder layer and the key vectors from the output of the encoder. The output is then computed as a weighted sum of the value vectors from the encoder's output, where the weights are the attention scores.
    
    The position-wise feed-forward network works exactly the same as in the encoder. It applies a simple transformation to the output of the multi-head attention layer.
    
    The Add & Norm steps also function similarly to those in the encoder, aiding in training and stabilizing the output.
    
3. **Full Process of the Decoder Running:**
    
    The decoder processes the input sequence one token at a time, producing an output token at each step. For each token, the decoder first applies the masked multi-head self-attention mechanism, allowing the token to interact with all previous tokens in the output sequence.
    
    The output of the self-attention mechanism is then passed to the multi-head attention layer that attends over the encoder's output. This allows the decoder to incorporate information from the input sequence into its output.
    
    The output of this attention layer is then passed through a position-wise feed-forward network, which applies a simple transformation to the output.
    
    Finally, after each of the three sub-layers (self-attention, attention over the encoder's output, and position-wise feed-forward), the Transformer adds a residual connection and applies layer normalization.
    
    The final output of the decoder is a sequence of tokens that are predicted based on the input sequence and the previously generated tokens in the output sequence.
    
    Each layer in the decoder processes the input independently, with the output from one layer serving as input to the next. This means that the decoder is composed of a 'stack' of layers, with the final output being produced by the last layer.
