### Basic Principles

The Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is an extension of the Kalman Filter, which is designed for linear systems. The <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">EKF is tailored to handle nonlinear systems</mark> by <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">linearizing them around the current estimate</mark>. It is widely used in SLAM for both localization and mapping due to its ability to estimate the state of a system in the presence of noise.

### Mathematical Formulation

**State Representation**:
- The state vector $\mathbf{x}_t$ typically includes the robot's position $(x, y, \theta)$ and the positions of landmarks $(l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_n)$.

**Prediction Step**:
- Uses the robot's motion model to predict the next state.
- The <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">state prediction</mark> is given by:

  $$
  \mathbf{x}_t^- = f(\mathbf{x}_{t-1}, \mathbf{u}_t) + \mathbf{w}_t
  $$

  where:
  - $\mathbf{x}_t^-$ is the predicted state.
  - $f(\mathbf{x}_{t-1}, \mathbf{u}_t)$ is the nonlinear motion model.
  - $\mathbf{w}_t$ represents the process noise.

- The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">covariance prediction</mark> is given by:

  $$
  \mathbf{P}_t^- = \mathbf{F}_t \mathbf{P}_{t-1} \mathbf{F}_t^\top + \mathbf{Q}_t
  $$

  where:
  - $\mathbf{P}_t^-$ is the predicted covariance.
  - $\mathbf{F}_t$ is the Jacobian of the motion model with respect to the state.
  - $\mathbf{Q}_t$ is the process noise covariance.

**Update Step**:
- Incorporates sensor measurements to correct the predicted state.
- The Kalman gain is computed as:

  $$
  \mathbf{K}_t = \mathbf{P}_t^- \mathbf{H}_t^\top (\mathbf{H}_t \mathbf{P}_t^- \mathbf{H}_t^\top + \mathbf{R}_t)^{-1}
  $$

  where:
  - $\mathbf{H}_t$ is the Jacobian of the observation model with respect to the state.
  - $\mathbf{R}_t$ is the measurement noise covariance.

- The state update is given by:

  $$
  \mathbf{x}_t = \mathbf{x}_t^- + \mathbf{K}_t (\mathbf{z}_t - h(\mathbf{x}_t^-))
  $$

  where:
  - $\mathbf{z}_t$ is the measurement.
  - $h(\mathbf{x}_t^-)$ is the nonlinear observation model.

- The covariance update is given by:

  $$
  \mathbf{P}_t = (\mathbf{I} - \mathbf{K}_t \mathbf{H}_t) \mathbf{P}_t^-
  $$

### Advantages and Limitations

**Advantages**:
- Handles nonlinear systems.
- Provides a probabilistic framework for dealing with uncertainty.

**Limitations**:
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Computationally expensive</mark> for large-scale environments.
- Can be sensitive to initial estimates and linearization errors.

### Example Implementation

1. **Initialization**:
   - Set the initial state $\mathbf{x}_0$ and covariance matrix $\mathbf{P}_0$.

2. **Prediction**:
   - Use the motion model to predict the next state:

     $$
     \mathbf{x}_t^- = f(\mathbf{x}_{t-1}, \mathbf{u}_t)
     $$

   - Update the covariance matrix:

     $$
     \mathbf{P}_t^- = \mathbf{F}_t \mathbf{P}_{t-1} \mathbf{F}_t^\top + \mathbf{Q}_t
     $$

3. **Update**:
   - Compute the Kalman gain:

     $$
     \mathbf{K}_t = \mathbf{P}_t^- \mathbf{H}_t^\top (\mathbf{H}_t \mathbf{P}_t^- \mathbf{H}_t^\top + \mathbf{R}_t)^{-1}
     $$

   - Correct the predicted state:

     $$
     \mathbf{x}_t = \mathbf{x}_t^- + \mathbf{K}_t (\mathbf{z}_t - h(\mathbf{x}_t^-))
     $$

   - Update the covariance matrix:

     $$
     \mathbf{P}_t = (\mathbf{I} - \mathbf{K}_t \mathbf{H}_t) \mathbf{P}_t^-
     $$

4. **Iteration**:
   - Repeat the prediction and update steps as new data is received.

By iteratively applying these steps, the EKF can maintain a probabilistic estimate of the robot's state and the map of the environment.
