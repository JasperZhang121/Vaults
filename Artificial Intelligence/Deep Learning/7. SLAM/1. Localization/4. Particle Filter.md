### Introduction
The Particle Filter (PF), also known as Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC), is a <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">non-parametric Bayesian filtering algorithm</mark> used for estimating the state of a dynamic system. Unlike the Kalman Filter, which is limited to linear and Gaussian systems, the Particle Filter can handle non-linear and non-Gaussian systems by representing the state distribution with a set of random samples, or "particles."

### Mathematical Foundations

#### State Representation
In the Particle Filter, the state distribution is represented by <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">a set of particles</mark>, each with an associated weight:
$$\{\mathbf{x}_k^{[i]}, w_k^{[i]}\}_{i=1}^N$$
where:
- $\mathbf{x}_k^{[i]}$ is the state of the i-th particle at time step k.
- $w_k^{[i]}$ is the weight of the i-th particle at time step k.
- $N$ is the number of particles.

### Particle Filter Algorithm

The Particle Filter algorithm consists of three main steps: prediction, update, and resampling.

#### 1. Prediction Step
In the prediction step, each particle is propagated forward according to the process model, incorporating process noise.

$$\mathbf{x}_k^{[i]} = f(\mathbf{x}_{k-1}^{[i]}, \mathbf{u}_k) + \mathbf{w}_k^{[i]}$$
where:
- $f$ is the process model function.
- $\mathbf{w}_k^{[i]}$ is the process noise for the i-th particle, typically sampled from a zero-mean Gaussian distribution.

#### 2. Update Step
In the update step, the weight of each particle is updated based on the likelihood of the observed measurement given the particle's state.

$$w_k^{[i]} \propto w_{k-1}^{[i]} \cdot p(\mathbf{z}_k | \mathbf{x}_k^{[i]})$$
where:
- $p(\mathbf{z}_k | \mathbf{x}_k^{[i]})$ is the measurement likelihood, which evaluates how well the particle's state explains the observed measurement.

#### 3. Resampling Step
In the resampling step, particles with low weights are discarded, and particles with high weights are duplicated to focus computational resources on the more likely states. Various resampling methods can be used, such as multinomial resampling, systematic resampling, or stratified resampling.

### Detailed Mathematical Explanation

#### Prediction Step
Each particle $\mathbf{x}_k^{[i]}$ is sampled from the process model distribution:
$$\mathbf{x}_k^{[i]} \sim p(\mathbf{x}_k | \mathbf{x}_{k-1}^{[i]}, \mathbf{u}_k)$$
This can be approximated by:
$$\mathbf{x}_k^{[i]} = f(\mathbf{x}_{k-1}^{[i]}, \mathbf{u}_k) + \mathbf{w}_k^{[i]}$$
#### Update Step
The importance weight $w_k^{[i]}$ is updated based on the measurement likelihood:
$$w_k^{[i]} \propto w_{k-1}^{[i]} \cdot p(\mathbf{z}_k | \mathbf{x}_k^{[i]})$$
The weights are then normalized:
$$w_k^{[i]} = \frac{w_k^{[i]}}{\sum_{j=1}^N w_k^{[j]}}$$

#### Resampling Step
Resampling involves generating a new set of particles by sampling \( N \) times from the current set of particles with replacement, according to their weights. This step can be implemented using algorithms like:

- **Multinomial Resampling**: Sample \( N \) particles based on a multinomial distribution defined by the weights.
- **Systematic Resampling**: Ensures a more even spread of particles by using a single random value to sample across the cumulative weight distribution.
- **Stratified Resampling**: Similar to systematic resampling but adds jitter within each stratum to reduce variance.

### Example

Consider a simple 1D state estimation problem where the state represents the position of an object. The process model is given by:
$$x_k = x_{k-1} + u_k + w_k$$
where $u_k$ is the control input (e.g., velocity) and $w_k \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_w^2)$ is the process noise.

The measurement model is:
$$z_k = x_k + v_k$$
where $v_k \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_v^2)$ is the measurement noise.

1. **Prediction Step**:
   For each particle $\mathbf{x}_{k-1}^{[i]}$:
  $$\mathbf{x}_k^{[i]} = \mathbf{x}_{k-1}^{[i]} + u_k + w_k^{[i]}$$
2. **Update Step**:
   For each particle $\mathbf{x}_k^{[i]}$:
   $$w_k^{[i]} \propto \exp \left( -\frac{(z_k - \mathbf{x}_k^{[i]})^2}{2 \sigma_v^2} \right)$$

3. **Resampling Step**:
   Resample $N$ particles from the current set $\{\mathbf{x}_k^{[i]}, w_k^{[i]}\}$ based on their weights.
