**1. Introduction:**
- **Definition:** XLNet stands for "Extra Long Transformer." It is a generalized autoregressive pre-training model for natural language understanding tasks. 
- **Developers:** Developed by researchers at Google/Brain, Carnegie Mellon University, and Stanford University in 2019.

**2. Background & Motivation:**
- **Addressing BERT's Limitations:** While BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) revolutionized NLP by using a masked language model, it has limitations, especially regarding its pre-training objective. BERT's masking process doesn't account for the prediction order of words. XLNet aims to tackle this issue.

**3. Key Features & Innovations:**
- **Permutation-based Training:** Unlike BERT, which masks and predicts words in parallel, <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">XLNet predicts words auto-regressively in all possible orders</mark>. It leverages all permutations of the input sequence, thereby learning bidirectional context.

- **Two-stream Self-attention:** This mechanism allows XLNet to handle target (to be predicted) and observed words differently during training, maintaining separate representations for each.

- **Segment Recurrence:** XLNet uses segment-level recurrence and relative positional encoding. This allows it to remember the content from a previous segment, making it beneficial for tasks with longer contexts.

**4. Training Data and Model Architecture:**
- **Datasets:** XLNet is trained on a combination of the Toronto Book Corpus and English Wikipedia, similar to BERT. 
- **Architecture:** It leverages the Transformer-XL architecture, which introduces recurrence mechanisms to the standard Transformer, making it particularly effective for modeling longer sequences.

**5. Comparison with BERT:**
- **Modeling Capabilities:** While BERT's bidirectionality comes from masking tokens and predicting them, XLNet's bidirectionality arises from its permutation-based training. This allows XLNet to potentially capture more intricate patterns in data.

- **Performance:** Upon release, XLNet outperformed BERT on several NLP benchmarks, showcasing the advantages of its training methodology.

**6. Application and Usage:**
- **Tasks:** XLNet can be used for a wide range of NLP tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, question answering, and more.
  
- **Fine-tuning:** Like other Transformer models, after pre-training, XLNet is typically fine-tuned on task-specific data to achieve optimal performance for that particular task.

**7. Considerations:**
- **Complexity:** Due to its permutation-based approach, XLNet can be more computationally intensive compared to other models like BERT.

- **Benefits Over BERT:** XLNet's unique training strategy allows it to overcome some of the criticisms of BERT, particularly the unnatural masking process. By considering all permutations, it captures richer contextual information.
