Backpropagation is a widely used algorithm for training neural networks. It is an efficient method to <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">calculate the gradient of the loss function</mark> with respect to the weights of the network.

The backpropagation algorithm is based on the<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;"> chain rule of calculus</mark>, which allows the calculation of the derivative of a composite function. In the context of neural networks, the composite function is the network itself, which consists of multiple layers of neurons.

The backpropagation algorithm starts by calculating the output of the neural network for a given input. This output is compared to the desired output, and the <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">difference between the two is used to calculate the loss function</mark>. The goal of backpropagation is to minimize this loss function by adjusting the weights of the network.

To do this, backpropagation computes the <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights of the network</mark>. This is done by applying the chain rule of calculus to calculate the partial derivatives of the loss function with respect to the weights in each layer of the network.

The backpropagation algorithm is typically applied to a feedforward neural network, which consists of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each neuron in the network applies a weighted sum of its inputs, followed by a nonlinear activation function. The output of each neuron is then passed to the next layer of neurons.

The backpropagation algorithm proceeds in two phases:

1.  Forward Propagation: In this phase, the input data is fed forward through the network, and the output of each neuron is computed based on its weighted sum and activation function.
    
2.  Backward Propagation: In this phase, the error is propagated backwards through the network. The gradient of the loss function is calculated with respect to the output of each neuron, and then recursively with respect to the inputs and weights of each neuron in the network. The gradient is then used to update the weights of the network to minimize the loss function.


The backpropagation algorithm is often used in combination with gradient descent to optimize the weights of the network. The gradient descent algorithm uses the gradient calculated by backpropagation to update the weights in the direction that minimizes the loss function.

The backpropagation algorithm can be summarized by the following formula:

$\dfrac{\partial L}{\partial w_{ij}} = \dfrac{\partial o_j}{\partial net_j} \cdot \dfrac{\partial L}{\partial o_j} \cdot \dfrac{\partial net_j}{\partial w_{ij}}$


where:

-   L is the loss function
-   $w_{ij}$ is the weight of the connection between neuron i and neuron j
-   $o_j$ is the output of neuron j
-   $net_j$ is the weighted sum of the inputs to neuron j
-   $\frac{\partial L}{\partial w_{ij}}$ is the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weight $w_{ij}$.

The backpropagation algorithm is a powerful tool for training neural networks, and has been instrumental in the success of deep learning.
