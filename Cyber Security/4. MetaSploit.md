Metasploit is a powerful penetration testing framework developed by Rapid7. It offers a comprehensive set of tools and resources for assessing the security of networks and systems. Here are the key points to remember:

1. Metasploit Framework: The core component of Metasploit is the open-source Metasploit Framework. It provides a command-line interface and libraries for creating, testing, and executing exploits against target systems.
    
2. Modules: Metasploit uses three types of modules:
    
    - Exploits: These modules leverage vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access or control over target systems.
    - Payloads: Code snippets or scripts executed on compromised systems, providing attackers with desired functionality.
    - Auxiliary: Modules used for reconnaissance, scanning, and information gathering.
3. Interfaces: Metasploit offers different interfaces:
    
    - Console Interface: Command-line interface for interacting with the framework.
    - Web Interface: A graphical user interface (GUI) known as the Metasploit Web UI.
    - Armitage: A user-friendly GUI front-end for Metasploit, facilitating exploit and target management.
