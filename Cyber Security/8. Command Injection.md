Command injection refers to a security vulnerability that occurs when an application allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system. This vulnerability arises when user-supplied input is not properly validated or sanitized before being used as part of a command that is executed by the system.

Brief explanation:

1. Vulnerability: Command injection typically occurs in web applications that allow user input to be directly included in commands executed by the server. This can happen when user-supplied data, such as form inputs or query parameters, is used without proper validation or sanitization.
    
2. Exploitation: An attacker can exploit command injection by injecting malicious commands or special characters into the application's input fields or parameters. These injected commands are then executed by the server, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system.
    
3. Impact: Command injection can have severe consequences, as it allows attackers to execute commands with the same privileges as the vulnerable application. This can lead to unauthorized access, data leakage, system compromise, or even complete control over the affected system.
    
4. Prevention and Mitigation: To prevent command injection vulnerabilities, it is crucial to implement proper input validation and sanitization techniques. Use input validation to restrict user input to expected values and sanitize any user-supplied data by escaping or removing special characters. Additionally, it is advisable to employ secure coding practices and frameworks that provide protection against command injection.

### SQL injection 
a type of web application vulnerability and attack technique that allows an attacker to manipulate a website's database by inserting malicious SQL statements into an entry field. It occurs when user-supplied input is not properly validated or sanitized before being used in an SQL query.

The website's code might construct an SQL query like:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '<username>' AND password = '<password>'
```

The values `<username>` and `<password>` are supposed to be replaced with the user-supplied input. However, if the website does not properly validate or sanitize the input, an attacker can exploit this vulnerability.

```sql
' OR '1'='1' --
```

If the input is not sanitized, the resulting SQL query becomes:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR '1'='1' --' AND password = '<password>'
```

SQL injection attacks can have severe consequences, including unauthorized access to sensitive data, data manipulation, and even complete system compromise. Here are a few more examples of SQL injection attack techniques:

1. Union-based SQL Injection: An attacker injects a malicious query that uses the `UNION` operator to combine results from different database tables. This can be used to extract sensitive information or infer the database schema.
    
2. Blind SQL Injection: In this case, the attacker's injected queries don't result in visible information on the webpage. However, by carefully constructing queries and analyzing the application's responses, an attacker can infer information or perform actions indirectly.
    
3. Time-based SQL Injection: An attacker injects queries that introduce delays in the database's response. By observing the response times, the attacker can gather information about the database or extract data incrementally.

### SQLMap
an open-source penetration testing tool used to detect and exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities in web applications.

- Studying SQLMap helps in vulnerability assessment, as it identifies SQL injection flaws and weaknesses in application security.
- Understanding SQLMap enables insights into exploitation techniques, helping comprehend how attackers can leverage SQL injection vulnerabilities.
- Knowledge of SQLMap supports the development of secure coding practices, including input validation, parameterized queries, and input sanitization, to prevent SQL injection attacks.
- SQLMap is commonly utilized in penetration testing engagements, enhancing skills in ethical hacking and vulnerability assessment.
- Responsible and authorized use of SQLMap is crucial, and it should only be used within the bounds of legal and ethical frameworks.
