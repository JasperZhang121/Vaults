Command injection refers to a security vulnerability that occurs when an application allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system. This vulnerability arises when user-supplied input is not properly validated or sanitized before being used as part of a command that is executed by the system.

Brief explanation:

1. Vulnerability: Command injection typically occurs in web applications that allow user input to be directly included in commands executed by the server. This can happen when user-supplied data, such as form inputs or query parameters, is used without proper validation or sanitization.
    
2. Exploitation: An attacker can exploit command injection by injecting malicious commands or special characters into the application's input fields or parameters. These injected commands are then executed by the server, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system.
    
3. Impact: Command injection can have severe consequences, as it allows attackers to execute commands with the same privileges as the vulnerable application. This can lead to unauthorized access, data leakage, system compromise, or even complete control over the affected system.
    
4. Prevention and Mitigation: To prevent command injection vulnerabilities, it is crucial to implement proper input validation and sanitization techniques. Use input validation to restrict user input to expected values and sanitize any user-supplied data by escaping or removing special characters. Additionally, it is advisable to employ secure coding practices and frameworks that provide protection against command injection.
