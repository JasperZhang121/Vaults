Cybersecurity refers to the protection of internet-connected systems, including hardware, software, and data, from cyber threats. The practice is used by individuals and enterprises to protect against unauthorized access to data centers and other computerized systems.

### Types of Cyber Threats

- **Malware**: Malicious software such as viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware, spyware.
- **Phishing**: An attack that sends an email that appears to be from a trustworthy source, but is not. The aim is to steal sensitive data like credit card numbers and login information.
- **Man-in-the-middle (MitM) Attack**: Attackers interrupt the communication between two parties to steal data.
- **Denial-of-service attack**: Attackers flood a network with traffic to exhaust resources and bandwidth, causing the network to become slow or even unresponsive.
- **SQL Injection**: Attackers use malicious code to manipulate your database into revealing information.

### Cybersecurity Principles

- **Confidentiality**: Ensuring that data is accessible only to those authorized to have access.
- **Integrity**: Assuring the accuracy and completeness of data during its lifecycle.
- **Availability**: Ensuring that the systems responsible for delivering, storing and processing data are accessible when needed, by those who need them.

### Cybersecurity Tools and Techniques

- **Firewalls**: These are your first line of defense in network security.
- **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**: These systems detect suspicious activity and send an alert to the system or network administrator.
- **Antivirus Software**: This is the most common tool to protect against malware.
- **Encryption**: This is a method of encoding data, making it unreadable until it is decrypted.
- **Virtual Private Networks (VPN)**: This tool provides a secure internet connection on a public or unsecured Wi-Fi network.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: This technique provides an extra layer of security when logging into applications by requiring at least two forms of identification.

### Cybersecurity Best Practices

- **Educate all users**: Users are often the weakest link in security, so it's important that they are educated about the risks and best practices.
- **Keep all systems and software up to date**: This is crucial because updates often include patches for security vulnerabilities.
- **Backup data regularly**: Regular backups help to protect your data in the event of a physical disaster or data corruption.
- **Use strong, unique passwords**: This is a simple yet effective way to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Limit access control**: Give users only the access they need and no more.
