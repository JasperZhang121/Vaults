### TCP/IP Protocols

1. **Definition**: TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is a suite of communication protocols used to interconnect network devices on the internet. TCP/IP specifies how data should be packaged, addressed, transmitted, routed, and received at the destination.
    
2. **Layers**: TCP/IP operates on a four-layer model:
    
    - **Network Interface Layer**: Responsible for placing TCP/IP packets on the network medium and receiving TCP/IP packets off the network medium.
    - **Internet Layer**: Handles the movement of packets around the network such as IP addressing, routing, and packaging.
    - **Transport Layer**: Responsible for end-to-end error recovery and flow control. This includes segmentation, sequencing, and acknowledgment. Two main protocols at this layer are TCP and UDP.
    - **Application Layer**: Closest to the end-user, this layer includes protocols that provide user services or exchange application data (HTTP, SMTP, FTP, etc.).

### Network Topology

1. **Definition**: Network topology refers to the arrangement of different elements (links, nodes, etc.) of a computer network. It defines how devices are connected and interact with each other.
    
2. **Types**: Main types of network topologies include:
    
    - **Star**: All nodes are connected to a central hub. The hub acts as a repeater and is used for managing all the data.
    - **Ring**: Every node has exactly two neighbors for communication purposes, forming a circular network structure.
    - **Bus**: All nodes are connected to a common medium, which serves as a backbone of the network.
    - **Tree**: This is a hybrid topology that combines the characteristics of linear bus and star topologies.
    - **Mesh**: Every node is directly connected to each other.
