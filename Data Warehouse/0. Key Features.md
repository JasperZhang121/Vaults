### Data Warehouse Characteristics

#### Theme-Oriented
Operational databases are organized around transaction processing tasks, with <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">each business system operating independently</mark>. In contrast, data within a data warehouse is organized according to specific subject domains. A theme is an abstract concept that represents the key aspects users focus on when making decisions with the data warehouse. Typically, a theme is related to multiple operational information systems.

#### Integrated
Transactional operational databases are often associated with specific applications, operating independently and usually heterogeneously. Data in a data warehouse, however, is extracted, cleansed, and processed from these disparate operational databases to ensure consistency. The goal is to <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">eliminate inconsistencies</mark> in the source data, ensuring the information within the data warehouse presents a unified, comprehensive view of the entire enterprise.

#### Relatively Stable
Data in operational databases is frequently updated in <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">real-time</mark>, changing as needed. Conversely, data warehouse data, primarily used for business decision-making and analysis, involves mainly data queries. Once data is entered into the data warehouse, it is generally <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">retained for a long period</mark>. This means data warehouses typically experience a high volume of query operations with minimal modifications or deletions, requiring only periodic loading and refreshing.

#### Reflects Historical Changes
Operational databases focus on data within a specific timeframe, while data warehouses <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">encompass historical information</mark>. This historical record tracks the enterprise's development from a past point in time (such as when the data warehouse was first implemented) to the present, enabling quantitative analysis and forecasting of the enterprise's growth trajectory and future trends.

### Data Warehouse Layers

#### 1. Data Loading Layer: ETL (Extract-Transform-Load)
The Data Loading Layer is responsible for the ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) processes, where data is <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">extracted from various source systems, transformed to fit the operational needs, and loaded into the data warehouse</mark>. This layer ensures that data is properly integrated and formatted for subsequent operations.

#### 2. Data Operation Layer: ODS (Operational Data Store)
The ODS layer, also known as the subject-oriented data operation layer, is the <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">closest layer to the data source</mark>. Data from the source is extracted, cleaned, and loaded into this layer. Generally, data in this layer is classified according to the original business system classification of the source data.

To facilitate potential data tracing needs, <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">minimal data cleaning</mark> is recommended for this layer. Raw data is loaded as-is, while noise removal, deduplication, and outlier processing are handled in the subsequent DWD layer.

#### 3. Data Warehouse Layer: DW (Data Warehouse)
The Data Warehouse Layer is the core design layer in data warehousing. Data obtained from the ODS layer is used to establish various data models according to specific themes. The DW layer is further divided into three sub-layers:

- 3.1 Data Detail Layer: DWD (Data Warehouse Detail)
	This layer maintains the same data granularity as the ODS layer and provides a certain level of data quality assurance. To enhance usability, dimension reduction techniques are applied, integrating dimensions into fact tables and reducing associations between fact and dimension tables. Additionally, this layer aggregates data of the same theme into a single table to improve data usability.

- 3.2 Data Middle Layer: DWM (Data WareHouse Middle)
	Based on the data from the DWD layer, this layer performs light aggregation operations to generate a series of intermediate tables, enhancing the reusability of common metrics and reducing redundant processing. In essence, it aggregates common core dimensions and calculates corresponding statistical metrics.

- 3.3 Data Service Layer: DWS (Data WareHouse Service)
	Also known as data marts or wide tables, this layer generates wide tables with numerous fields based on business divisions such as traffic, orders, and users, facilitating subsequent business queries, OLAP analysis, and data distribution. Typically, this layer contains fewer tables, each covering a wide range of business content. Due to the large number of fields, these tables are often referred to as wide tables.

In practical computations, directly calculating statistical metrics from the DWD or ODS layers to wide tables can be computationally intensive and dimensionally insufficient. Therefore, the common approach is to first<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;"> compute several small intermediate tables in the DWM layer and then concatenate them into a wide table in the DWS layer</mark>. Given the ambiguous boundary between wide and narrow tables, the DWM layer can be omitted, consolidating all data in the DWS layer.

#### 4. Data Application Layer: APP (Application)
This layer primarily <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">provides data for data products and analysis</mark>. It is typically stored in systems like Elasticsearch (ES), PostgreSQL, or Redis for online use, or Hive or Druid for data analysis and mining. For instance, report data is often stored here.

#### 5. Dimension Table Layer (DIM)
The Dimension Table Layer mainly consists of:

- **High-Cardinality Dimension Data:** Generally includes <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">user profile tables</mark>, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">product profile tables</mark>, etc., with data volumes potentially in the tens of millions or billions.
- **Low-Cardinality Dimension Data:** Typically includes <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">configuration tables</mark>, such as enum values with corresponding meanings or date dimension tables, with data volumes possibly in the single digits, thousands, or tens of thousands.
