1. **Theme-Oriented**
   Operational databases are organized around transaction processing tasks, with each business system operating independently. In contrast, data within a data warehouse is organized according to specific subject domains. A theme is an abstract concept that represents the key aspects users focus on when making decisions with the data warehouse. Typically, a theme is related to multiple operational information systems.

2. **Integrated**
   Transactional operational databases are often associated with specific applications, operating independently and usually heterogeneously. Data in a data warehouse, however, is extracted, cleansed, and processed from these disparate operational databases to ensure consistency. The goal is to eliminate inconsistencies in the source data, ensuring the information within the data warehouse presents a unified, comprehensive view of the entire enterprise.

3. **Relatively Stable**
   Data in operational databases is frequently updated in real-time, changing as needed. Conversely, data warehouse data, primarily used for business decision-making and analysis, involves mainly data queries. Once data is entered into the data warehouse, it is generally retained for a long period. This means data warehouses typically experience a high volume of query operations with minimal modifications or deletions, requiring only periodic loading and refreshing.

4. **Reflects Historical Changes**
   Operational databases focus on data within a specific timeframe, while data warehouses encompass historical information. This historical record tracks the enterprise's development from a past point in time (such as when the data warehouse was first implemented) to the present, enabling quantitative analysis and forecasting of the enterprise's growth trajectory and future trends.
