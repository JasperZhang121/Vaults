In Kubernetes, each container is provided with a <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">rich environment that supplies several essential resources</mark>, allowing containers to communicate, access system data, and manage data through file systems, environment variables, and DNS.

#### Key Resources in the Container Environment

1. **Filesystem**:
   - Each container in Kubernetes has a dedicated filesystem. This consists of:
     - **Container Image**: Contains the base file system used by the container.
     - **Volumes**: Additional storage can be mounted in the container, providing persistence or access to shared data across multiple containers.

2. **Container-Specific Information**:
   - Kubernetes automatically assigns certain values to each container, making them accessible to the container's application code. These include:
     - **Hostname**: The hostname of a container defaults to the Pod name. It can be retrieved using the `hostname` command or through the `gethostname` function in libc.
     - **Pod Name and Namespace**: Available as environment variables using the Kubernetes [Downward API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/environment-variable-expose-pod-information/).
     - **User-Defined Environment Variables**: These are specified within the Pod's manifest file and are injected into the container at runtime.
     - **Static Environment Variables**: Variables predefined within the container image are also available.

3. **Cluster Information**:
   - Kubernetes exposes specific details about the cluster environment to containers:
     - **Services**: Each service running in the same namespace when a container is created will be available as an environment variable to that container. For example, a service named `foo` running on a host with a particular IP and port would define:
       - `FOO_SERVICE_HOST`: The IP address of the `foo` service.
       - `FOO_SERVICE_PORT`: The port on which the `foo` service is accessible.
     - **DNS**: If the Kubernetes DNS addon is enabled, services have dedicated IP addresses and can be accessed via DNS. This simplifies the service discovery process for applications running within containers.

### Example

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: example-pod
  namespace: default
spec:
  containers:
  - name: example-container
    image: busybox
    command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "while true; do echo 'Container is running...'; sleep 60; done"]
    
    # Define custom environment variables
    env:
    - name: CUSTOM_ENV_VAR
      value: "Hello from Kubernetes!"
    
    # Use the Downward API to expose Pod and Namespace information as environment variables
    env:
    - name: POD_NAME
      valueFrom:
        fieldRef:
          fieldPath: metadata.name
    - name: POD_NAMESPACE
      valueFrom:
        fieldRef:
          fieldPath: metadata.namespace

    # Use a mounted volume for persistent storage
    volumeMounts:
    - name: data-volume
      mountPath: "/data"

  volumes:
  - name: data-volume
    emptyDir: {}  # Creates a temporary storage that lasts for the Pod's lifecycle
```

### Explanation

1. **Filesystem Access**:
   - The `volumeMounts` and `volumes` sections define a volume (`data-volume`) mounted to the path `/data` within the container. The `emptyDir` volume type creates temporary storage that persists only for the Pod's lifecycle.

2. **Container-Specific Information**:
   - Environment variables `POD_NAME` and `POD_NAMESPACE` are set using the Kubernetes Downward API to provide access to the Pod's name and namespace.
   - A custom environment variable, `CUSTOM_ENV_VAR`, is also defined in the Pod spec with the value "Hello from Kubernetes!"

3. **Cluster Service Information**:
   - If a service called `my-service` exists in the `default` namespace, Kubernetes will automatically create environment variables for it in this format:
     - `MY_SERVICE_SERVICE_HOST` – IP of `my-service`.
     - `MY_SERVICE_SERVICE_PORT` – Port on which `my-service` is running.

### Running and Testing the Pod

1. **Create the Pod** by saving the configuration in a file named `example-pod.yaml` and applying it:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f example-pod.yaml
   ```

2. **Verify Environment Variables** by connecting to the running container:
   ```bash
   kubectl exec -it example-pod -- sh
   ```

   Inside the container, check the environment variables:
   ```sh
   echo $POD_NAME             # Output should be "example-pod"
   echo $POD_NAMESPACE        # Output should be "default"
   echo $CUSTOM_ENV_VAR       # Output should be "Hello from Kubernetes!"
   ```
