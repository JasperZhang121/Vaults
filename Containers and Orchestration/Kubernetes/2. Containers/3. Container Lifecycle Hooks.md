Kubernetes provides <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">lifecycle hooks for containers, enabling them to respond to events in their lifecycle</mark> by running specific code via designated handlers. These hooks, analogous to lifecycle hooks in various programming frameworks, help manage container states more precisely.

### Available Hooks

1. **PostStart**: Triggered immediately after container creation. It runs parallel to the container's `ENTRYPOINT` and may not complete first.
2. **PreStop**: Called before container termination due to API requests or lifecycle events. The hook completes before the container receives the `TERM` signal.

### Hook Handlers

Each hook can be configured with one of three handler types:

1. **Exec**: Runs a command within the container.
2. **HTTP**: Sends an HTTP request to a specified endpoint on the container.
3. **Sleep**: Pauses the container for a specified duration (enabled by `PodLifecycleSleepAction` feature gate).

### Example Usage of Lifecycle Hooks

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: lifecycle-demo
spec:
  containers:
  - name: lifecycle-demo-container
    image: nginx
    lifecycle:
      postStart:
        exec:
          command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "echo Hello, Kubernetes!"]
      preStop:
        httpGet:
          path: /shutdown
          port: 8080
    ports:
    - containerPort: 8080
```

This configuration specifies `postStart` with an `exec` command and `preStop` with an HTTP request to `path: /shutdown`.

### Hook Execution Details

- **PostStart**: Runs simultaneously with the container’s entry point. A long-running or hanging hook delays the container from reaching a `Running` state.
- **PreStop**: Completes before sending a `TERM` signal. If the hook takes longer than `terminationGracePeriodSeconds`, Kubernetes kills the container after the grace period.

#### Hook Delivery and Retries

- Hooks aim to run **at least once** per event, though multiple deliveries may occur in rare cases (e.g., kubelet restarts).
- There’s no retry mechanism if a hook fails due to reasons like network issues.

#### Debugging Hooks

If a hook fails, events such as `FailedPostStartHook` or `FailedPreStopHook` are logged. Use `kubectl describe` to diagnose issues with hook execution.

**Example Debugging Command**:
```sh
kubectl describe pod lifecycle-demo
```

**Sample Output**:
```plaintext
Events:
  Warning  FailedPostStartHook  4s (x2 over 5s)  kubelet  Exec lifecycle hook ([badcommand]) failed - error: command 'badcommand' exited with 126
```
