The **Container Runtime Interface (CRI)** is a plugin interface that enables the Kubernetes **kubelet** to interact with <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">various container runtimes</mark>. This flexibility allows Kubernetes to support multiple container runtimes without modifying or recompiling the cluster components.

### Purpose of CRI

- **Primary Communication Protocol**: The CRI defines the gRPC protocol that enables the kubelet to manage containers and images on a node.
- **Runtime Compatibility**: By using CRI, the kubelet can interact with any container runtime that supports CRI without additional adjustments.

Each node in a Kubernetes cluster must have a compatible container runtime for the kubelet to launch and manage Pods and containers.

### How CRI Works

The kubelet serves as a **gRPC client** that connects to the container runtime on each node. CRI specifies two primary endpoints:
1. **Runtime Service Endpoint**: Manages lifecycle operations for containers, such as starting and stopping containers.
2. **Image Service Endpoint**: Manages image operations, such as pulling and removing container images.

You can configure these endpoints in the kubelet using the `--image-service-endpoint` command-line flag.

### CRI API Versioning

- **Preferred Version**: Starting from **Kubernetes v1.31**, the kubelet prefers to use **CRI v1**.
- **Fallback Compatibility**: If a runtime does not support CRI v1, the kubelet attempts to use older supported versions. The `v1alpha2` version of CRI is considered deprecated, but the kubelet can negotiate it as a last resort.
- **Registration Failure**: If the kubelet cannot establish a compatible CRI version, it will not register the node in the cluster.

### Upgrading Kubernetes with CRI

When upgrading Kubernetes:
- **Automatic CRI Selection**: The kubelet tries to connect to the most recent supported CRI version upon restart.
- **Fallback Process**: If the latest version is unsupported, the kubelet will attempt to use older CRI versions as a fallback.
- **gRPC Re-Dial**: If the container runtime is upgraded, the kubelet may require a gRPC redial to match the selected CRI version. This requires both the kubelet and container runtime to support the same CRI version for successful reconnection.
