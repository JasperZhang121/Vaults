This guide outlines the <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">paths and methods of communication</mark> between nodes and the Kubernetes control plane, enabling secure configurations that allow clusters to operate on untrusted networks or fully public IPs in cloud environments.

### Communication Paths

#### 1. Node to Control Plane

Kubernetes uses a **hub-and-spoke** pattern where all communication from nodes (or the pods they host) is directed to the API server. Key aspects include:

- **API Server Endpoint**: The API server is configured to listen on a secure HTTPS port (typically 443) with <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">client authentication and authorization enabled</mark>.
- **Node Security Setup**: Nodes are provisioned with the cluster’s public root certificate and valid client credentials to connect securely to the API server. The kubelet on each node can use client certificates for secure communication, with the option to automate this via **kubelet TLS bootstrapping**.
  
**Pod Communication**: Pods needing API server access can securely connect using a service account, which provides a public root certificate and a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">valid bearer</mark> token. The `kubernetes` service (in the default namespace) is set up with a virtual IP that forwards to the API server’s HTTPS endpoint through `kube-proxy`.

#### 2. Control Plane to Node

There are two primary communication methods from the control plane to nodes:

- **API Server to Kubelet**: 
  - The API server connects to the kubelet on each node to:
    - Fetch logs.
    - Attach to running pods.
    - Enable port-forwarding.
  - These <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">connections terminate</mark> at the kubelet’s HTTPS endpoint, and by default, the API server does not verify the kubelet’s certificate, making the connection insecure on untrusted networks.
  - **Securing the Connection**:
    - Use the `--kubelet-certificate-authority` flag to verify the kubelet’s serving certificate.
    - Use SSH <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">tunneling if the connection</mark> must be routed through an untrusted network.
    - Enable kubelet authentication and authorization.

- **API Server to Nodes, Pods, and Services**:
  - By default, these connections are in plain HTTP, which is unauthenticated and unencrypted.
  - For HTTPS, prefix `https:` to the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">target node, pod, or service name in the API URL</mark>. This secures the connection but does not validate the endpoint’s certificate or provide client credentials.
  - **Note**: These connections are not safe for untrusted or public networks.

### Enhanced Security Options

#### SSH Tunnels (Deprecated)

Kubernetes supports **SSH tunnels** to secure traffic between the control plane and nodes. Here, the <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">API server creates an SSH tunnel (typically on port 22) to each node</mark>, routing all kubelet, node, pod, or service traffic through the tunnel. However, SSH tunnels are deprecated and should be avoided unless necessary.

#### Konnectivity Service

As an alternative to SSH tunnels, **Konnectivity Service** (beta in Kubernetes v1.18+) provides a secure TCP proxy for control plane-to-cluster communication.

- **Components**:
  - **Konnectivity Server**: Runs in the control plane network.
  - **Konnectivity Agents**: Operate in the node network and initiate connections to the Konnectivity Server, maintaining secure network connections for control plane traffic.

To enable, follow the [Konnectivity setup guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/control-plane-node-communication/#konnectivity-service) for configuring Konnectivity in your cluster.
