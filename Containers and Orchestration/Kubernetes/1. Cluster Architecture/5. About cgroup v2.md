**cgroups** (control groups) in Linux are mechanisms for <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">managing and limiting the resources that processes can access</mark>. In Kubernetes, cgroups are crucial for managing **resource allocation** (e.g., CPU and memory) for Pods and containers. Kubernetes and the container runtime interface with cgroups to enforce resource constraints specified for containerized workloads.

### What is cgroup v2?

**cgroup v2** is the second generation of the Linux cgroup API and introduces enhancements for unified and efficient <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">resource management</mark>. Some improvements over cgroup v1 include:

- **Unified Hierarchy**: A single control hierarchy simplifies resource management.
- **Enhanced Resource Allocation**: Improved isolation across resources, such as CPU and memory.
- **Memory QoS Support**: MemoryQoS, a feature that enhances memory quality of service, relies on cgroup v2.
- **Sub-tree Delegation**: Safer delegation of resources to containers.
- **Pressure Stall Information**: Provides insights into system performance under high resource load.
- **Unified Memory Accounting**: Tracks different memory types (e.g., network memory, kernel memory).

Starting from **Kubernetes v1.25**, several features are optimized to use cgroup v2, leveraging these enhanced capabilities for better resource control.

### Using cgroup v2 in Kubernetes

#### Prerequisites

To use cgroup v2 in Kubernetes, you need:
1. **Linux Kernel version**: 5.8 or later.
2. **Container Runtime**: Compatible with cgroup v2. Examples include:
   - `containerd` v1.4+
   - `cri-o` v1.20+
3. **Cgroup Driver**: The kubelet and container runtime must be configured to use the `systemd` cgroup driver.
4. **Linux Distribution Support**: Some distributions support cgroup v2 by default. Examples include:
   - **Container Optimized OS** (M97+)
   - **Ubuntu** (21.10+, recommended 22.04+)
   - **Debian** (11 “bullseye”)
   - **Fedora** (31+)
   - **Arch Linux** (since April 2021)
   - **RHEL** (9+)

#### Checking cgroup Version

To verify if your Linux distribution uses cgroup v2, run:

```bash
stat -fc %T /sys/fs/cgroup/
```

- **Output `cgroup2fs`**: Indicates cgroup v2.
- **Output `tmpfs`**: Indicates cgroup v1.

### Enabling cgroup v2 Manually

If your distribution does not use cgroup v2 by default, you can enable it by modifying the kernel command-line arguments:

1. Edit `/etc/default/grub`:
   ```bash
   GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="systemd.unified_cgroup_hierarchy=1"
   ```
2. Update GRUB:
   ```bash
   sudo update-grub
   ```
3. Reboot the system to apply changes.

> **Note**: It is generally recommended to use a distribution that natively supports cgroup v2.

### Migrating to cgroup v2

Migrating to cgroup v2 requires:
- Updating to a compatible kernel version and meeting other prerequisites.
- Once the environment is configured, the kubelet automatically detects and uses cgroup v2.

No major differences in user experience are expected during the transition to cgroup v2, except for applications or monitoring agents that interact directly with the cgroup file system. These applications must be compatible with cgroup v2.

#### Application Compatibility

Applications accessing the cgroup file system must support cgroup v2. Here are some key compatibility notes:
- **Monitoring/Security Agents**: Update third-party agents to versions that support cgroup v2.
- **cAdvisor**: Update to v0.43.0+ for compatibility.
- **Java Applications**: Use versions that support cgroup v2, such as:
  - **OpenJDK / HotSpot**: 8u372, 11.0.16, 15+
  - **IBM Semeru Runtimes**: 8.0.382.0, 11.0.20.0, 17.0.8.0+
  - **IBM Java**: 8.0.8.6+
- **uber-go/automaxprocs**: Use v1.5.1 or higher.
