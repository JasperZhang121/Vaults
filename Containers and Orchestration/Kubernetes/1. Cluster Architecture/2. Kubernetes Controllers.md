In Kubernetes, **controllers** are automated <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">control loops that monitor the state of your cluster</mark> and make necessary adjustments to bring the cluster’s current state closer to the desired state. Similar to how a thermostat maintains a room’s temperature, controllers in Kubernetes adjust resources to match the desired configuration.

### Controller Pattern

Each **controller** monitors at least one <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Kubernetes resource type, such as Pods or Jobs</mark>. The desired state of these resources is defined in the `spec` field, and the controller is responsible for making the actual state match this desired state. Controllers achieve this either by directly making changes or by sending requests to the API server, which causes other parts of the control plane to respond.

### Control via API Server

A typical controller pattern in Kubernetes involves <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">indirect control</mark> through the **API server**. For example:
- **Job Controller**: The Job controller monitors Job resources. When a new Job is created, the controller ensures that the required number of Pods are running to complete the Job. It does not run Pods directly but tells the API server to create or remove Pods as needed. The control plane then acts on this information to schedule and run the Pods.

Once a Job completes, the Job controller updates the Job resource to indicate it has finished, similar to how a thermostat might indicate that the target temperature is reached.

### Direct Control

Some controllers require changes outside the Kubernetes cluster. For example:
- **Node Autoscaling Controller**: This type of controller adjusts the number of nodes in a cluster, requiring external services to set up new nodes as needed. The controller monitors the desired state through the API server and directly communicates with external systems to meet resource requirements.

These controllers update the API server with the current state after making changes, enabling other control loops to observe the updated state and respond accordingly.

### Desired State vs. Current State

Kubernetes assumes a **cloud-native approach** where constant change is expected, and cluster stability is not necessarily the goal. Controllers continuously work to keep the cluster’s current state aligned with the desired state, even if the cluster’s state never remains stable.

As long as controllers can make useful changes, the dynamic environment of the cluster remains operational and adaptive to workload demands.

### Controller Design

Kubernetes uses numerous **specialized controllers** to manage various aspects of cluster operations. Each controller typically:
- Tracks one resource type to determine desired state (e.g., Jobs).
- Manages another resource type to fulfill the desired state (e.g., Pods for Job execution).

For instance, a Job controller monitors Job resources and creates Pods as needed to complete the Job. This separation allows simpler, more modular controllers, enhancing Kubernetes’ resilience in case of individual controller failures.

#### Coordinating Multiple Controllers

In Kubernetes, multiple controllers may operate on the same resource type without conflict. For instance:
- Both **Deployments** and **Jobs** create Pods.
- Controllers use labels or other metadata to distinguish between Pods managed by different resources, ensuring the Job controller doesn’t interfere with Pods created by a Deployment.

### Running Controllers

Kubernetes has several ways to run controllers:

#### Built-in Controllers

The **kube-controller-manager** runs a set of built-in controllers, such as the Deployment and Job controllers. These controllers provide essential behaviors that support core cluster functionality. Kubernetes' resilient design ensures that if a built-in controller fails, another instance within the control plane can take over.

#### Custom Controllers

For additional functionality, you can run custom controllers that operate independently of the control plane. These controllers can:
- Run as Pods within the cluster.
- Operate externally to Kubernetes, depending on the requirements of the specific controller.

Custom controllers enable you to extend Kubernetes to handle new types of resources or integrate with external systems.
