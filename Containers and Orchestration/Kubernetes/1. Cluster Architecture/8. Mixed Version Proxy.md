**Mixed Version Proxy** is a Kubernetes feature (introduced in v1.28 as alpha) that allows an <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">API server to proxy resource requests to other API servers within a cluster</mark>. This is especially useful during cluster upgrades where different API servers may run different Kubernetes versions. Mixed Version Proxy helps avoid unexpected 404 errors, enabling seamless communication with the correct API server for each resource request.

### Benefits of Mixed Version Proxy

1. **Smooth Upgrades**: Allows safe, high-availability upgrades by forwarding resource requests to the correct API server version.
2. **Error Prevention**: Minimizes the occurrence of 404 errors due to version mismatches, maintaining operational continuity during rollouts.
3. **Version Flexibility**: Supports clusters with multiple API server versions, making upgrades and version transitions more manageable.

### Enabling Mixed Version Proxy

To enable Mixed Version Proxy, start the kube-apiserver with the following flags:

```bash
kube-apiserver \
--feature-gates=UnknownVersionInteroperabilityProxy=true \
--peer-ca-file=<path to kube-apiserver CA cert> \
--proxy-client-cert-file=<path to aggregator proxy cert> \
--proxy-client-key-file=<path to aggregator proxy key> \
--requestheader-client-ca-file=<path to aggregator CA cert> \
--requestheader-allowed-names=<valid Common Names>
```

Additional optional flags:
- **`--peer-advertise-ip`**: IP address used by peer API servers to connect.
- **`--peer-advertise-port`**: Port used by peer API servers for proxying requests.

### Authentication and Transport Security

- **Client Authentication**: The source API server presents its identity via `--proxy-client-cert-file` and `--proxy-client-key-file`.
- **Peer Verification**: The destination server authenticates the client certificate using `--requestheader-client-ca-file`.
- **Destination Authentication**: The source server verifies the destination’s certificates using `--peer-ca-file`.

### Network Configuration

The kube-apiserver uses **`--peer-advertise-ip`** and **`--peer-advertise-port`** to specify the network location for peer connections. If these are not set, it defaults to **`--advertise-address`** or **`--bind-address`**. If those are also unset, the system’s default network interface is used.

### How Mixed Version Proxy Works

1. **Request Handling**: When an API server receives a resource request:
   - If the API server knows how to serve the request, it processes it locally.
   - If the API server doesn’t recognize the resource, it tries to proxy the request to a peer API server that can handle it.

2. **Internal Check**: The API server checks the **StorageVersion** API to find if another server in the cluster can handle the requested resource.

3. **Proxying the Request**:
   - If the **StorageVersion** API reveals a compatible peer, the handling API server proxies the request to this peer.
   - If no peer can handle the request, the API server returns a 404 error.
   - If the peer server fails to respond, the source API server returns a 503 ("Service Unavailable") error.

### Example Scenario

1. A resource request, `GET /batch/v1/jobs`, is received by an API server that has `batch/v1` disabled.
2. The handling API server checks its **StorageVersion** API and finds another API server in the cluster that supports `batch/v1`.
3. The request is proxied to the peer API server, which responds successfully.
4. If the peer server cannot respond, a 503 error is returned to the client.
