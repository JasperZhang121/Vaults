**Garbage collection** in Kubernetes refers to <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">a set of mechanisms that automatically clean up cluster resources</mark>. This includes terminating Pods, completed Jobs, orphaned objects, unused containers and images, dynamically provisioned volumes, stale CertificateSigningRequests, and certain node objects.

### Key Garbage Collection Scenarios

1. **Terminated Pods and Completed Jobs**
   - Pods that have terminated and Jobs that have completed can be cleaned up automatically by Kubernetes, freeing resources and decluttering the cluster.

2. **Orphaned Objects**
   - Objects that lack **owner references** (due to the deletion of their parent object) are <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">marked for garbage collection to prevent resource leakage</mark>.
   
3. **Unused Containers and Images**
   - The kubelet on each node performs garbage collection on:
     - **Unused Images**: Cleaned every two minutes.
     - **Unused Containers**: Cleaned every minute.
   - The kubelet's image manager and cadvisor manage the lifecycle of images based on disk usage thresholds.

4. **Dynamically Provisioned PersistentVolumes**
   - PersistentVolumes with a **Delete** reclaim policy are removed once they are no longer in use, freeing up storage resources.

5. **Stale CertificateSigningRequests (CSRs)**
   - Expired or unused CSRs are removed from the cluster as part of garbage collection.

6. **Nodes in Cloud and On-Prem Environments**
   - Nodes that are deleted (either from the cloud when using a cloud controller manager, or on-premises with a similar addon) are also cleaned up.

7. **Node Lease Objects**
   - Kubernetes periodically clears old Lease objects related to node heartbeats and leader election when nodes are removed.

### Owner References and Dependencies

**Owner references** establish dependencies between Kubernetes objects, where deletion of the owner object triggers actions on the dependent objects. Owner references ensure proper cleanup of resources that rely on other resources.

- **Cross-Namespace Restrictions**: Dependents can only <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">reference owners within the same namespace or cluster scope</mark>. Cross-namespace references are not allowed.
- **Cluster-Scoped Dependents**: Must have a cluster-scoped owner. If a cluster-scoped dependent references a namespaced kind, it cannot be garbage collected.

To check for invalid owner references, use:
```bash
kubectl get events -A --field-selector=reason=OwnerRefInvalidNamespace
```

### Cascading Deletion

**Cascading deletion** allows Kubernetes to delete dependent objects automatically when the parent object is deleted. There are two types:

1. **Foreground Cascading Deletion**
   - The parent object first enters a “deletion in progress” state, allowing dependents to be deleted before the owner itself is removed. 
   - The `metadata.deletionTimestamp` and `metadata.finalizers=foregroundDeletion` fields are set on the owner object during this process.

2. **Background Cascading Deletion**
   - The API server deletes the owner object immediately, and the garbage collector cleans up dependents in the background. This is the default behavior in Kubernetes.

3. **Orphaned Dependents**
   - By default, Kubernetes deletes dependents when an owner is deleted. You can override this to leave dependents behind (orphans) if needed.

### Garbage Collection of Containers and Images

The kubelet performs regular garbage collection of unused containers and images. It can be configured to manage disk usage effectively.

1. **Image Lifecycle**
   - **Thresholds**:
     - `HighThresholdPercent`: When disk usage exceeds this threshold, unused images are deleted.
     - `LowThresholdPercent`: Garbage collection stops once disk usage falls below this level.
   - **Age Limit**:
     - Starting in **Kubernetes v1.30 (beta)**, you can set a maximum unused time for images using `imageMaximumGCAge` in the kubelet configuration.

2. **Container Lifecycle**
   - **Settings**:
     - `MinAge`: Minimum age for garbage collection.
     - `MaxPerPodContainer`: Maximum dead containers per Pod.
     - `MaxContainers`: Maximum dead containers in the cluster.
   - Conflicts between `MaxPerPodContainer` and `MaxContainers` result in kubelet adjustments to prevent exceeding limits.

### Configuring Garbage Collection

Garbage collection behaviors are tunable via kubelet and controller configurations:

- **Cascading Deletion**: Configure options for cascading deletion in the control plane.
- **Container Image and Lifecycle Tuning**: Adjust settings in the kubelet configuration file using `KubeletConfiguration` resources.
