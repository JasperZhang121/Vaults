You can use **Kubernetes annotations** to a<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">ttach arbitrary non-identifying metadata to objects</mark>. Tools and libraries can retrieve this metadata for various purposes.

### Attaching Metadata to Objects

- **Labels** and **annotations** are used to attach metadata to Kubernetes objects.
- **Labels** can identify and select objects.
- **Annotations** are not used for identification or selection.
  - The metadata in annotations can be small or large, structured or unstructured.
  - Labels and annotations can coexist in the metadata of the same object.

### Key/Value Map

Annotations are expressed as key/value pairs:

```yaml
"metadata": {
  "annotations": {
    "key1" : "value1",
    "key2" : "value2"
  }
}
```

- Keys and values must be strings (no numeric, boolean, or list types allowed).

### Examples of Annotation Usage

- **Declarative configuration fields**: Fields managed by a configuration layer, distinguished from default or auto-generated values.
- **Build and release information**: Including timestamps, release IDs, git branches, image hashes, etc.
- **Pointers**: To logging, monitoring, analytics, or audit repositories.
- **Client or tool information**: Used for debugging (e.g., name, version, build information).
- **Provenance information**: Such as URLs to related objects.
- **Lightweight rollout metadata**: Config or checkpoints for tools.
- **Contact information**: Phone or pager numbers of responsible individuals.
- **End-user directives**: Custom behavior or features.

### Why Use Annotations?

- Annotations can replace external databases or directories, simplifying shared client libraries and tools for deployment, management, and introspection.

### Syntax and Character Set

Annotations are **key/value pairs** where:

- The **key** consists of two segments:
  - An **optional prefix** and a **required name**.
  - The prefix, if specified, must be a DNS subdomain (e.g., `example.com/`).
  - The **name segment** must be 63 characters or less, start and end with an alphanumeric character, and can contain dashes (`-`), underscores (`_`), or dots (`.`).
  - Example: `imageregistry: "https://hub.docker.com/"`

- The prefixes `kubernetes.io/` and `k8s.io/` are reserved for Kubernetes core components.

### Example: Pod with Annotations

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: annotations-demo
  annotations:
    imageregistry: "https://hub.docker.com/"
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx:1.14.2
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
```

This manifest demonstrates a **Pod** with an annotation pointing to an image registry.
