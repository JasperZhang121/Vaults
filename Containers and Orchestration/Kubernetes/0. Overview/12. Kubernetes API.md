The Kubernetes API allows you to query and manipulate the state of Kubernetes objects, such as Pods, Namespaces, ConfigMaps, and more. The core of Kubernetes' control plane is the **API server**, which exposes an HTTP API. This API enables users, different components of your cluster, and external systems to communicate with each other.

### Key Features of the Kubernetes API

- The API lets you perform operations via tools like `kubectl` or directly using <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">REST calls</mark>.
- Kubernetes provides client libraries for interacting with the API, allowing you to write custom applications that leverage Kubernetes resources.

### API Specifications

Each Kubernetes cluster publishes the specifications for its APIs using two primary mechanisms:

#### 1. **Discovery API**

- The **Discovery API** provides information about available Kubernetes APIs, including names, resources, versions, and supported operations.
- It is a summary and does not provide detailed schemas of resources. For more in-depth details, you can refer to the OpenAPI document.

#### 2. **OpenAPI Document**

- The **OpenAPI Document** provides detailed schemas for all Kubernetes API endpoints.
- It is available in **OpenAPI v2.0** and **OpenAPI v3.0** formats, with v3 being preferred due to its more comprehensive coverage.
  
### Discovery API and OpenAPI Overview

#### Discovery API

The **Discovery API** publishes a list of all group versions and resources supported by the cluster. It includes:
- **Name**
- **Cluster or namespaced scope**
- **Endpoint URL and supported verbs**
- **Group, version, kind**

Discovery is available in both **aggregated** and **unaggregated** forms.

- **Aggregated Discovery**: Available since Kubernetes v1.30, aggregated discovery reduces the number of requests needed to fetch discovery data. It exposes two main endpoints (`/api` and `/apis`) that can return all resources supported by the cluster. It also supports ETag and protobuf encoding for efficient data exchange.
  
- **Unaggregated Discovery**: Discovery data is published at multiple levels, with root endpoints (`/api` and `/apis`) listing all group versions. Separate endpoints for each group version provide detailed discovery information about specific resources.

Example of an unaggregated discovery response:

```json
{
  "kind": "APIGroupList",
  "apiVersion": "v1",
  "groups": [
    {
      "name": "apps",
      "versions": [
        {
          "groupVersion": "apps/v1",
          "version": "v1"
        }
      ],
      "preferredVersion": {
        "groupVersion": "apps/v1",
        "version": "v1"
      }
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

#### OpenAPI Interface Definition

Kubernetes provides access to **OpenAPI v2.0** and **OpenAPI v3.0** specifications. These are used for detailed API schemas, including supported paths and resources. OpenAPI v3.0 is preferred for a more comprehensive and lossless representation of Kubernetes resources.

Example of OpenAPI v3.0 response:

```json
{
    "paths": {
        "api/v1": {
            "serverRelativeURL": "/openapi/v3/api/v1?hash=hashvalue"
        },
        "apis/apps/v1": {
            "serverRelativeURL": "/openapi/v3/apis/apps/v1?hash=hashvalue"
        },
        ...
    }
}
```

### Protobuf Serialization

Kubernetes also implements a **Protobuf** based serialization format, mainly intended for intra-cluster communication. It is more efficient and compact compared to JSON, and is used to serialize API objects.

### Persistence

Kubernetes stores the serialized state of API objects in **etcd**, the distributed key-value store used as the systemâ€™s backing store.

### API Groups and Versioning

Kubernetes supports multiple API versions and groups to evolve its API without breaking compatibility. This allows Kubernetes to:
- Add new resources and fields over time.
- Deprecate or remove resources while maintaining compatibility with older clients.

- **Versioning**: Resources are versioned using API paths like `/api/v1` or `/apis/rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1alpha1`. The API server transparently handles conversion between different versions.
- **API Groups**: Resources are grouped into logical API groups to provide flexibility in enabling or disabling certain features.

Example: If a resource has versions `v1` and `v1beta1`, you can create an object using `v1beta1` and later read or update it using either `v1beta1` or `v1`, until `v1beta1` is deprecated.

### API Extensions

Kubernetes allows for API extension via:

1. **Custom Resources (CRDs)**: These let you define custom APIs declaratively. Once a CRD is defined, the API server serves it like any other resource.
  
2. **Aggregation Layer**: You can extend Kubernetes' API by aggregating additional API servers under the Kubernetes API server.

### API Changes and Compatibility

Kubernetes is designed to continuously grow and change, adding new API resources and fields over time. The project maintains backward compatibility to ensure that existing clients continue to work.

- New API resources or fields are added frequently.
- Deprecated API versions or fields follow the API deprecation policy, ensuring ample time for users to transition to newer APIs.

For stable APIs (v1 or GA versions), Kubernetes commits to maintaining compatibility. However, for alpha APIs, changes may be required as new features evolve.
