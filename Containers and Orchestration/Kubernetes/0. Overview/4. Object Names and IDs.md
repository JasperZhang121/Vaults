### Naming and Identifying Objects in Kubernetes

Kubernetes employs several methods to uniquely identify and manage resources within a cluster. Understanding these identifiers and naming conventions is crucial for effectively managing and referencing Kubernetes objects.

### Names and UIDs

#### Names
Each object in a Kubernetes cluster has a **Name** that uniquely identifies it within its type of resource, for a given namespace. For instance:

- A Pod named `myapp-1234` can <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">only exist once within the same namespace</mark>. However, you could also have a Deployment named `myapp-1234` in the same namespace because they are different types of resources.

Names are client-provided strings that appear in a resource URL, such as `/api/v1/pods/some-name`. Names must be unique across all API versions of the same resource, irrespective of the API group, resource type, and namespace. Names can be reused if the object is deleted, allowing a new object to take the same name.

**Note**: Care must be taken when objects like Nodes represent physical entities. <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Reusing a name without deleting the corresponding Kubernetes object might lead to inconsistencies</mark> if the physical entity is replaced.

#### UIDs
A **UID** is a system-generated string that <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">uniquely identifies an object</mark> across the entire Kubernetes cluster. This identifier is critical for distinguishing between historical occurrences of similar entities. Kubernetes UIDs conform to the universally unique identifiers (UUID) standard, as defined in ISO/IEC 9834-8 and ITU-T X.667.

### Naming Constraints

Kubernetes defines several types of naming constraints for resources, based on their intended use and compatibility with DNS standards.

#### DNS Subdomain Names
Most resources require names that comply with the DNS subdomain specifications from RFC 1123:

- **Maximum Length**: 253 characters
- **Valid Characters**: Lowercase alphanumeric characters, '-', and '.'
- **Start/End**: Must start and end with an alphanumeric character

#### RFC 1123 Label Names
Applicable to some resources, these names must adhere to the DNS label standard from RFC 1123:

- **Maximum Length**: 63 characters
- **Valid Characters**: Lowercase alphanumeric characters or '-'
- **Start/End**: Must start and end with an alphanumeric character

#### RFC 1035 Label Names
Similar to RFC 1123 but with a slight variation for starting characters:

- **Maximum Length**: 63 characters
- **Valid Characters**: Lowercase alphanumeric characters or '-'
- **Start**: Must start with a lowercase alphabetic character
- **End**: Must end with an alphanumeric character

#### Path Segment Names
For resources that must be encoded as a URL path segment:

- **Restrictions**: Names cannot be "." or "..", nor can they contain '/' or '%'

### Additional Naming Rules

Some Kubernetes resources may have further restrictions on their names, based on their specific requirements and operational contexts.

**Example Manifest**: Here is a manifest for a Pod named `nginx-demo` which adheres to these naming conventions:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-demo
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx:1.14.2
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
```
