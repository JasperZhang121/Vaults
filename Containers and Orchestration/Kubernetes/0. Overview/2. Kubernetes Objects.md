### Objects In Kubernetes

Kubernetes objects are crucial for managing cluster states and understanding Kubernetes object models is key to effectively working with these objects. Here, we'll explore the basics of Kubernetes objects, how they're represented in the Kubernetes API, and how you can define them using YAML.

### Understanding Kubernetes Objects

Kubernetes objects are persistent entities within the Kubernetes ecosystem. These objects are instrumental in representing the state of your cluster. They detail the configuration of:

- **Containerized applications** and their node distribution.
- **Resources** available to applications.
- **Policies** dictating application behavior, such as restarts, upgrades, and fault-tolerance.

Creating a Kubernetes object serves as a record of intent. Once established, the Kubernetes system constantly ensures that the object exists, aligning the actual state of your cluster with the desired state specified through the object.

### Interacting with Kubernetes Objects

To manipulate Kubernetes objects—be it creation, modification, or deletion—you'll engage with the Kubernetes API. This can be facilitated through the kubectl command-line tool, which abstracts the API calls for ease of use, or directly through the API for more customized interactions via Client Libraries.

### Object Spec and Status

Most Kubernetes objects contain two critical nested fields:

- **Spec:** Defines the <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">desired state</mark> of the object, which you must set during object creation.
- **Status:** Reflects the <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">current state</mark> as maintained and updated by the Kubernetes system.

For instance, in a Kubernetes Deployment, the **spec** might specify that three instances of an application should be running. The system then actively manages the deployment to ensure the **status** matches this spec, adjusting as necessary to handle failures and maintain the desired state.

### Describing Kubernetes Objects in YAML

When defining a Kubernetes object, you'll <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">typically use a YAML file to specify the necessary data, including the object's desired state and metadata.</mark> This file, often referred to as a manifest, includes fields such as `apiVersion`, `kind`, `metadata`, and `spec`.

Here's an example of a YAML manifest for a Kubernetes Deployment:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  replicas: 2
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.14.2
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

To deploy this using kubectl, you would run:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/application/deployment.yaml
```

#### Detailed Explanation of a Kubernetes Deployment YAML

Here's a breakdown of each section in the YAML file for a Kubernetes Deployment named `nginx-deployment`:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
```
- **apiVersion**: Specifies the version of the Kubernetes API you're using. For Deployments, `apps/v1` is commonly used, as it refers to a stable version of the Deployment API that supports several advanced features.

```yaml
kind: Deployment
```
- **kind**: Indicates the type of Kubernetes object you want to create. In this case, it's a `Deployment`, which manages a set of replica Pods running the same application.

```yaml
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
```
- **metadata**: Metadata about the Kubernetes object, which helps in <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">uniquely identifying it within the cluster</mark>.
  - **name**: The name of the Deployment, used to uniquely identify it within a namespace.

```yaml
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
```
- **spec**: Specifies the desired state of the Deployment.
  - **selector**: Defines how the Deployment finds which Pods to manage. 
    - **matchLabels**: This map of key-value pairs must match a corresponding set of labels on the Pods that the Deployment is to manage. In this case, it's looking for Pods with a label `app` that equals `nginx`.

```yaml
  replicas: 2
```
- **replicas**: Specifies the desired number of Pods the Deployment should maintain at any given time. In this case, the Deployment ensures that two Pods running your application are always up and running.

```yaml
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
```
- **template**: Defines the template for the Pods managed by the Deployment.
  - **metadata**:
    - **labels**: Key-value pairs that are attached to the Pods created from this template, making them discoverable by the above `selector`. The label `app: nginx` is applied to each Pod, matching the selector criteria of the Deployment.

```yaml
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.14.2
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```
- **spec** within the template: Describes the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">configuration of the containers that will be part of the Pods</mark>.
  - **containers**: A list of container specifications within the Pod.
    - **name**: The name of the container within the Pod. It's a good practice to name your containers clearly for debugging and management purposes.
    - **image**: The Docker image to use for the container. Here, it uses `nginx:1.14.2`, which refers to a specific version of the Nginx server.
    - **ports**:
      - **containerPort**: Specifies the network port that this container exposes. In this example, it exposes port 80, commonly used by web servers.

### Required Fields for Manifests

In your manifest files, ensure to define:

- **apiVersion:** Specifies the Kubernetes API version.
- **kind:** Type of object you are creating.
- **metadata:** Provides identifying data for the object like name and UID.
- **spec:** Describes the desired state of the object.

Each object type has a specific format for the `spec` field, detailed in the Kubernetes API Reference for that object.

## Additional Notes

- **Configuration Best Practices:** Helpful for writing effective YAML files.
- **Server-Side Field Validation:** As of Kubernetes v1.25, this feature checks for unrecognized or duplicate fields, enhancing the validation process previously handled by the `kubectl --validate` flag.
