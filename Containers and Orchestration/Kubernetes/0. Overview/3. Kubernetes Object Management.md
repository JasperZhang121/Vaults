### Managing Kubernetes Objects with kubectl

The `kubectl` <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">command-line tool</mark> offers multiple approaches for creating and managing Kubernetes objects. This document outlines these methods and provides insights into which technique might be best suited for your environment. For comprehensive details on managing Kubernetes objects using `kubectl`, refer to the Kubectl book.

### Overview of Management Techniques

When managing Kubernetes objects, it's crucial to use only one technique for a given object to avoid undefined behavior. Hereâ€™s a summary of the different management techniques:

### 1. Imperative Commands

- **Operates on**: Live objects
- **Recommended Environment**: Development projects
- **Supported Writers**: 1 or more
- **Learning Curve**: Lowest

**Description**:
Imperative commands allow <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">direct operations on live objects</mark> in the cluster. Users provide operations as arguments or flags to the `kubectl` command. This method is ideal for getting started or managing one-off tasks without a history of previous configurations.

**Examples**:
```bash
kubectl create deployment nginx --image nginx
```

**Trade-offs**:
- **Advantages**:
  - Single action command
  - Immediate changes to the cluster
- **Disadvantages**:
  - No integration with change review processes
  - No audit trail or record of changes beyond live state
  - Lacks templates for creating new objects

### 2. Imperative Object Configuration

- **Operates on**: Individual files
- **Recommended Environment**: Production projects
- **Supported Writers**: 1
- **Learning Curve**: Moderate

**Description**:
This technique involves specifying operations (like create or replace), optional flags, and file names containing full object definitions in YAML or JSON. It provides more control and integrates better with version control systems.

**Examples**:
```bash
kubectl create -f nginx.yaml
kubectl delete -f nginx.yaml -f redis.yaml
kubectl replace -f nginx.yaml
```

**Trade-offs**:
- **Advantages**:
  - Configurations can be stored and versioned in source control
  - Supports change review and audit processes
  - Provides templates for creating new objects
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Requires basic understanding of YAML and object schemas
  - More steps involved (e.g., writing and maintaining YAML files)

### 3. Declarative Object Configuration

- **Operates on**: Directories of files
- **Recommended Environment**: Production projects
- **Supported Writers**: 1 or more
- **Learning Curve**: Highest

**Description**:
In declarative management, users work with local object configuration files but do not specify operations explicitly. `kubectl` automatically determines whether to create, update, or delete objects based on the current state of the cluster and the state defined in the files.

**Examples**:
```bash
kubectl diff -f configs/
kubectl apply -f configs/
kubectl diff -R -f configs/
kubectl apply -R -f configs/
```

**Trade-offs**:
- **Advantages**:
  - Retains changes made directly to live objects
  - Supports operations on directories and automatic operation detection
- **Disadvantages**:
  - More complex to debug and understand, especially with partial updates
  - Can involve intricate merge and patch operations
