Namespaces in Kubernetes serve as a method for <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">isolating groups of resources </mark>within a single cluster, allowing for more organized management and allocation of cluster resources.

### Purpose of Namespaces

Namespaces are primarily used in environments with numerous users distributed across various teams or projects. They provide several key functionalities:

- **Isolation**: Namespaces help separate cluster resources for different teams or projects.
- **Resource Management**: They allow for the division of cluster resources between multiple users via resource quotas.

#### When to Use Namespaces
- **Small Clusters**: For clusters with a few users, namespaces might not be necessary.
- **Larger Clusters**: Start using namespaces when you need to manage access and resources across a diverse user base.

#### Characteristics of Namespaces
- **Unique Names Within a Namespace**: Resource names must be unique within a namespace but can duplicate across different namespaces.
- **Non-nested**: Namespaces <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">cannot be nested inside one another</mark>, and each Kubernetes resource can only reside in one namespace.
- **Not for Minor Variations**: Avoid using namespaces to separate minor variations of the same resource; instead, use labels within the same namespace.

### Initial Namespaces in Kubernetes
Upon installation, Kubernetes includes four pre-configured namespaces:

1. **`default`**: Used for objects without a specific namespace.
2. **`kube-node-lease`**: Holds Lease objects associated with each node to facilitate node heartbeats.
3. **`kube-public`**: Readable by anyone, including unauthenticated users. It's often used for public resources accessible throughout the cluster.
4. **`kube-system`**: Contains objects created by the Kubernetes system itself.

#### Important Note
Avoid creating namespaces with the prefix `kube-`, as this is reserved for Kubernetes system namespaces.

### Managing Namespaces

#### Creation and Deletion
Refer to the Kubernetes Admin Guide for specific instructions on creating and deleting namespaces.

#### Viewing Namespaces
You can list all the current namespaces in a cluster with:
```bash
kubectl get namespace
```

#### Configuring Namespace Preferences
- **For a Single Request**: Use the `--namespace` flag to specify the namespace.
  ```bash
  kubectl run nginx --image=nginx --namespace=<namespace-name>
  kubectl get pods --namespace=<namespace-name>
  ```
- **Permanently**: Set the default namespace for all subsequent kubectl commands.
  ```bash
  kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=<namespace-name>
  ```

## Namespaces and DNS
Services within a namespace create a DNS entry in the form `<service-name>.<namespace-name>.svc.cluster.local`. This DNS structure aids in distinguishing services across namespaces, crucial for environments like Development, Staging, and Production.

### Warning
Creating namespaces that match public top-level domain names can cause DNS conflicts. Limit namespace creation privileges to trusted users and consider additional security measures if necessary.

## Namespace-Scoped and Cluster-Scoped Resources

- **Namespaced Resources**: Such as pods and services, are within a specific namespace.
- **Cluster-Scoped Resources**: Such as nodes and persistentVolumes, do not belong to any namespace.

To check which resources are namespaced or not:
```bash
kubectl api-resources --namespaced=true   # Namespaced resources
kubectl api-resources --namespaced=false  # Non-namespaced resources
```

## Automatic Labeling
Since Kubernetes 1.22, the control plane automatically adds an immutable label `kubernetes.io/metadata.name` to all namespaces, reflecting the namespace name.

### Example

Imagine you have a Kubernetes cluster shared by two teams in your organization: Team A (working on a frontend project) and Team B (working on a backend project). To keep their resources isolated, you create separate namespaces for each team.

#### Creating Namespaces:
You can create namespaces like this:

```bash
kubectl create namespace team-a
kubectl create namespace team-b
```

Now, Team A’s resources (like pods, services, and config maps) will live in the `team-a` namespace, and Team B’s resources will reside in the `team-b` namespace. This ensures that they are <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">logically separated, even though they are running on the same cluster</mark>.

#### Deploying Resources in Each Namespace:
When Team A deploys their application, they would specify their namespace, ensuring their resources do not conflict with Team B's.

```bash
kubectl run frontend --image=nginx --namespace=team-a
kubectl get pods --namespace=team-a
```

Similarly, Team B would deploy their backend services in the `team-b` namespace:

```bash
kubectl run backend --image=redis --namespace=team-b
kubectl get pods --namespace=team-b
```

#### Benefits of Using Namespaces:
- **Resource Isolation**: Each team's resources are isolated, so there’s no risk of accidentally overwriting or interacting with the other team’s services.
- **Resource Quotas**: You can <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">assign specific resource limits to each namespace</mark>, ensuring that Team A doesn’t consume all the CPU or memory that Team B needs.

For example, you might set resource quotas like this:

```bash
kubectl create quota team-a-quota --namespace=team-a --hard=cpu=10,memory=20Gi
```

This way, each team has clear boundaries for how much of the cluster's resources they can consume, preventing any one team from using up all the cluster's resources.

In this scenario, namespaces provide a method to **organize, manage, and isolate resources** within the same cluster, ensuring efficient operation across different projects or teams.
