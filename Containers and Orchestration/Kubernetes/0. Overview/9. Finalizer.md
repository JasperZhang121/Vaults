Finalizers are namespaced keys that instruct Kubernetes to <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">delay the deletion of a resource until specific conditions are met</mark>. They notify controllers to clean up resources that the deleted object owns before completing the deletion process.

#### How Finalizers Work

1. **Marking for Deletion:**
   - When you delete an object with finalizers, the Kubernetes API sets the `.metadata.deletionTimestamp` field and returns a 202 status code (HTTP "Accepted").
   - The object enters a "terminating" state, remaining in the cluster while the control plane or other components complete the actions specified by the finalizers.

2. **Finalizer Actions:**
   - Finalizers define tasks to be done before a resource is fully deleted, such as cleaning up related resources or infrastructure.
   - Once the cleanup tasks are completed, the controller removes the corresponding finalizer key from the `metadata.finalizers` field.

3. **Completion:**
   - When the `metadata.finalizers` field is empty, Kubernetes considers the resource deletion complete and fully removes the object from the cluster.

#### Common Use of Finalizers

Finalizers are often used for **garbage collection**, ensuring that any dependent resources are properly cleaned up before the primary resource is deleted.

For example:
- The `kubernetes.io/pv-protection` finalizer is automatically added to PersistentVolume (PV) objects to prevent accidental deletion while they are in use by a Pod. When the Pod stops using the PV, the finalizer is removed, allowing deletion.

#### How to Specify Finalizers

When creating a resource using a manifest, you can specify finalizers in the `.metadata.finalizers` field:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: my-pv
  finalizers:
    - kubernetes.io/pv-protection
spec:
  ...
```

#### Finalizer Deletion Process

- When a deletion request is made, Kubernetes adds the deletion timestamp (`.metadata.deletionTimestamp`).
- The object cannot be deleted until the `metadata.finalizers` field is cleared.
- If finalizer conditions are not met, the resource stays in the **Terminating** state.

**Important Notes:**
- You can remove existing finalizers, but **cannot add new ones** or modify the `deletionTimestamp` after it's set.
- Once deletion is requested, the resource cannot be restored.

#### Finalizers vs. Owner References

- **Owner References** describe the relationship between objects (e.g., Pods created by a Job) and indicate which objects should be cleaned up when the parent is deleted.
- **Finalizers**, on the other hand, define conditions or cleanup tasks that must be fulfilled before deletion.

#### Troubleshooting Deletion Issues

In some cases, finalizers can block deletion if dependencies are not cleaned up. This can cause objects to remain in a "deleting" state for longer than expected. If this happens:
- Check the finalizers and owner references on the object.
- Avoid forcefully removing finalizers unless you fully understand their purpose and have performed the necessary cleanup tasks manually.

### Example

### Scenario:

You are managing a PersistentVolume (PV) that stores important data for a Pod. Before the PV is deleted, you want to ensure that a custom cleanup process (e.g., archiving logs or moving data to another storage system) is triggered. To achieve this, you define a custom finalizer called `example.com/pv-cleanup` on the PV.

### Step-by-Step Walkthrough:

#### 1. **Creating a PersistentVolume with a Custom Finalizer**

Define a PV in a manifest file, specifying a finalizer in the `.metadata.finalizers` field. The finalizer `example.com/pv-cleanup` will prevent the PV from being deleted until a custom process is completed.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: my-pv
  finalizers:
    - example.com/pv-cleanup
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 10Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
  storageClassName: manual
  hostPath:
    path: /mnt/data
```

Here’s what happens:
- The PV `my-pv` is created and is associated with a finalizer (`example.com/pv-cleanup`).
- The finalizer ensures that before the volume is deleted, some custom cleanup task will be performed.

#### 2. **Creating a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC)**

Next, create a PVC to bind to the PV `my-pv`.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: my-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi
  volumeName: my-pv
```

The PVC `my-pvc` is bound to the PV `my-pv`. This PVC can be used by a Pod to consume the storage provided by the PV.

#### 3. **Binding the PVC to a Pod**

Now, create a Pod that uses the PVC for storage.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: my-container
      image: nginx
      volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: "/usr/share/nginx/html"
          name: my-storage
  volumes:
    - name: my-storage
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: my-pvc
```

The Pod `my-pod` is now using the PVC, which is bound to the PV `my-pv`. The data stored by the Pod is being written to the PV.

#### 4. **Attempting to Delete the PersistentVolume**

Let’s say you decide to delete the PV `my-pv` when it’s no longer needed. Normally, Kubernetes would attempt to delete the PV, but because it has a finalizer, the deletion will be delayed.

```bash
kubectl delete pv my-pv
```

When you run this command:
- Kubernetes marks the PV `my-pv` for deletion by adding a `deletionTimestamp` to its metadata.
- The PV enters a **"Terminating"** state, but it will not be fully deleted because of the finalizer `example.com/pv-cleanup`.

You can check the status of the PV with:

```bash
kubectl get pv my-pv -o yaml
```

Output will show the `deletionTimestamp` and that the object is in a "Terminating" state:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: my-pv
  deletionTimestamp: 2024-10-23T10:00:00Z
  finalizers:
    - example.com/pv-cleanup
spec:
  ...
status:
  phase: Terminating
```

#### 5. **Custom Cleanup Process (Handled by a Controller)**

Now, your custom controller (or manual process) is responsible for detecting that the PV `my-pv` has a `deletionTimestamp` and still contains the finalizer `example.com/pv-cleanup`. The controller will then perform the necessary cleanup tasks, such as:
- Archiving logs.
- Transferring data to a backup location.
- Sending a notification to the administrator.

After the cleanup tasks are completed, the controller removes the finalizer from the PV’s metadata.

```bash
kubectl patch pv my-pv --type='json' -p='[{"op": "remove", "path": "/metadata/finalizers"}]'
```

#### 6. **Deletion Completion**

Once the finalizer is removed, Kubernetes proceeds to delete the PV since the `metadata.finalizers` field is now empty.

You can confirm the deletion by checking the PV again:

```bash
kubectl get pv my-pv
```

If the finalizer has been removed and the cleanup is complete, the PV will no longer appear in the list, confirming its deletion.

#### 7. **Handling Stuck Resources**

In some cases, if the finalizer is not removed (for example, if the controller responsible for cleanup is misconfigured), the resource will remain in the **Terminating** state indefinitely.

You can check the finalizers on the object:

```bash
kubectl get pv my-pv -o jsonpath='{.metadata.finalizers}'
```

If necessary, and after ensuring that the required cleanup has been manually performed, you can forcefully remove the finalizer to allow deletion to proceed:

```bash
kubectl patch pv my-pv --type='json' -p='[{"op": "remove", "path": "/metadata/finalizers"}]'
```

#### 8. **Key Takeaways**

- **Finalizers** allow you to control when a resource is fully deleted, by ensuring that certain tasks (like cleanup) are performed beforehand.
- **Custom finalizers** can be created to fit your needs, such as performing custom cleanup of storage, infrastructure, or external systems.
- **Kubernetes built-in finalizers** like `kubernetes.io/pv-protection` prevent accidental deletion of critical resources, such as PersistentVolumes in use.
- Finalizers should only be forcefully removed when their purpose has been fulfilled, and the system is ready for the resource to be deleted.

#### Example with Built-in Finalizer

As an additional example, Kubernetes has a built-in finalizer, `kubernetes.io/pv-protection`, that works similarly to prevent the accidental deletion of PersistentVolumes:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: my-pv
  finalizers:
    - kubernetes.io/pv-protection
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 10Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
  storageClassName: manual
  hostPath:
    path: /mnt/data
```

In this case, the finalizer prevents deletion of the PV while it is in use. Once the associated Pod is no longer using the PV, Kubernetes automatically removes the `pv-protection` finalizer, allowing deletion to proceed.
