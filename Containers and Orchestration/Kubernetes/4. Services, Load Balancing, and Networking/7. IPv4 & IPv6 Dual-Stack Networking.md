Kubernetes supports **single-stack IPv4**, **single-stack IPv6**, and **dual-stack networking**, enabling simultaneous allocation of both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses to Pods and Services. 

**Dual-stack networking** was made stable in Kubernetes 1.23, with default support beginning in Kubernetes 1.21. This configuration is beneficial for workloads requiring both IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity.

### Supported Dual-Stack Features

1. **Dual-stack Pod Networking**: Each Pod can be assigned both an IPv4 and an IPv6 address.
2. **IPv4/IPv6 Enabled Services**: Services can have IPs from both address families.
3. **Off-cluster Egress Routing**: Allows routing through both IPv4 and IPv6 interfaces to reach external networks.

### Prerequisites

To enable dual-stack networking, ensure:

- **Kubernetes version**: 1.20 or later.
- **Provider support**: Dual-stack must be supported by the cloud provider or network infrastructure.
- **Network plugin**: Requires a CNI plugin compatible with dual-stack.

### Configuring Dual-Stack Networking

To enable dual-stack, configure cluster components with both IPv4 and IPv6 CIDRs:

- **kube-apiserver**: `--service-cluster-ip-range=<IPv4 CIDR>,<IPv6 CIDR>`
- **kube-controller-manager**:
  - `--cluster-cidr=<IPv4 CIDR>,<IPv6 CIDR>`
  - `--service-cluster-ip-range=<IPv4 CIDR>,<IPv6 CIDR>`
  - Set node CIDR mask size with `--node-cidr-mask-size-ipv4` (default /24) and `--node-cidr-mask-size-ipv6` (default /64).
- **kube-proxy**: `--cluster-cidr=<IPv4 CIDR>,<IPv6 CIDR>`
- **kubelet**: Specify node IPs with `--node-ip=<IPv4 IP>,<IPv6 IP>` for bare-metal setups.

### Dual-Stack Services

Services in Kubernetes can be configured to support IPv4, IPv6, or both. The address family defaults to the first IP range defined in `--service-cluster-ip-range`.

**Service Dual-Stack Configuration Options**:

- **SingleStack**: Default for Services, assigns a single IP based on the first IP family in `--service-cluster-ip-range`.
- **PreferDualStack**: Attempts to assign both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. Falls back to single-stack if dual-stack is unsupported.
- **RequireDualStack**: Allocates both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses for dual-stack enabled clusters only.

**Example Service Configuration**:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  ipFamilyPolicy: PreferDualStack
  selector:
    app: myapp
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
```

#### Setting IP Families

Define IP families directly in the `.spec.ipFamilies` field:

- **IPv4-only**: `["IPv4"]`
- **IPv6-only**: `["IPv6"]`
- **Dual-stack**: `["IPv4", "IPv6"]` or `["IPv6", "IPv4"]`

### Default and Existing Service Behavior on Enabling Dual-Stack

When upgrading to a dual-stack configuration:

1. **Existing Services** default to SingleStack with their current address family.
2. **Headless Services with Selectors**: Also default to SingleStack with the IP family of the first IP range configured.

#### Transitioning Between Single and Dual-Stack

- **To Dual-Stack**: Update `.spec.ipFamilyPolicy` to PreferDualStack or RequireDualStack.
- **To Single-Stack**: Set `.spec.ipFamilyPolicy` back to SingleStack, retaining the first address in `.spec.clusterIPs`.

### Dual-Stack Specific Service Types

1. **LoadBalancer Services**: For dual-stack load balancing, set `.spec.type` to LoadBalancer and `.spec.ipFamilyPolicy` to PreferDualStack or RequireDualStack. Cloud providers must support IPv4 and IPv6 load balancers for this feature.
2. **Headless Services without Selectors**: Default to RequireDualStack if `.spec.ipFamilyPolicy` is not set.

### Egress Traffic for Dual-Stack Pods

Egress traffic to external networks (e.g., the internet) from Pods using non-publicly routable IPv6 addresses requires mechanisms like IP masquerading (using `ip-masq-agent`) for public routing. Ensure your CNI plugin supports IPv6 for dual-stack egress traffic.

### Windows Support

- **IPv4/IPv6 Dual-Stack**: Supported on Windows with l2bridge networks.
- **Unsupported Network Types**: Overlay (VXLAN) does not support dual-stack on Windows.
- **IPv6-Only Networking**: Not supported on Windows nodes.
