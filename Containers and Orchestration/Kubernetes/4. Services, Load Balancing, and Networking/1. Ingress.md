**Ingress** is a Kubernetes resource for managing <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">HTTP/HTTPS</mark> access to services within a cluster using configurable rules for path-based and host-based routing.

### Overview

- **Purpose**: Ingress provides HTTP and HTTPS routes to services in the cluster, <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">managing traffic with features like load balancing, SSL termination, and name-based virtual hosting</mark>.
- **Controllers**: An Ingress resource requires an Ingress controller (e.g., NGINX Ingress controller) to be functional. It configures a load balancer or proxy to manage traffic.

### Key Concepts

1. **Rules**: Define how inbound HTTP/HTTPS traffic is routed to backend services.
2. **Default Backend**: Handles requests that do not match any specified rule in Ingress.
3. **Annotations**: Customize Ingress behavior; supported annotations depend on the controller.
4. **Path Types**:
   - **ImplementationSpecific**: Controller-specific path matching.
   - **Exact**: Matches the URL path exactly.
   - **Prefix**: Matches URL paths with the defined prefix.

### Example: Minimal Ingress Resource

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: minimal-ingress
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx-example
  rules:
    - http:
        paths:
          - path: /testpath
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: test
                port:
                  number: 80
```

### Ingress Features

1. **Host-based Routing**:
   - Routes requests based on the hostname in the requestâ€™s Host header.
   - Supports wildcards (e.g., `*.foo.com` matches `bar.foo.com`).

2. **Path-based Routing**:
   - Routes requests based on URL path prefixes, matching longest paths first.

3. **TLS Termination**:
   - Ingress supports TLS termination with specified secrets containing TLS certificates.
   - Example:
     ```yaml
     spec:
       tls:
         - hosts:
             - https-example.foo.com
           secretName: testsecret-tls
     ```

4. **Resource Backend**:
   - Allows ingress to non-service Kubernetes resources (e.g., static asset storage backends).

### Ingress Types and Use Cases

1. **Single Service**:
   - Routes all traffic to one service, using a default backend.
   
2. **Fanout Configuration**:
   - Routes traffic based on URL path prefixes to different services.
   
   Example:
   ```yaml
   rules:
     - host: foo.bar.com
       http:
         paths:
           - path: /foo
             backend:
               service:
                 name: service1
                 port:
                   number: 4200
           - path: /bar
             backend:
               service:
                 name: service2
                 port:
                   number: 8080
   ```

3. **Name-based Virtual Hosting**:
   - Routes based on Host headers for different services sharing the same IP address.

### Advanced Configuration

1. **Multiple Matches**:
   - If multiple paths match, Ingress selects the longest match. If two paths are equally matched, it prefers the `Exact` path type over `Prefix`.

2. **Load Balancing**:
   - Ingress controllers use predefined load balancing algorithms, often configurable per controller (e.g., NGINX or GCE Ingress).

3. **Failover and Availability Zones**:
   - Techniques to balance traffic across failure domains, which may vary by cloud provider.

### Managing Ingress Updates

- Use `kubectl edit ingress <name>` or modify and reapply the configuration using `kubectl replace -f` to update routing rules, add hosts, or modify paths.

### Alternatives to Ingress

- **Service.Type=LoadBalancer**: Directly provisions an external load balancer.
- **Service.Type=NodePort**: Exposes services on static ports across nodes.
