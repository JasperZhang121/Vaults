**Topology Aware Routing** is a Kubernetes feature designed to optimize network traffic by preferring routes within the same geographical zone where the traffic originates. This can improve **reliability**, **performance** (in terms of network latency and throughput), and potentially reduce **network costs** for clusters deployed across multiple zones.

#### Feature Overview
- **Feature State**: Beta (as of Kubernetes v1.23).
- Previously called **Topology Aware Hints** before Kubernetes 1.27.
- Adjusts traffic routing to favor same-zone connections by assigning topology hints to Service endpoints.

#### Motivation
Multi-zone Kubernetes deployments often require **efficient inter-zone traffic routing** to manage costs and performance. Topology Aware Routing helps reduce cross-zone traffic by preferring intra-zone traffic when possible.

#### Enabling Topology Aware Routing
Set the annotation `service.kubernetes.io/topology-mode: Auto` on a Service to activate Topology Aware Routing:
- When sufficient endpoints are available in each zone, **Topology Hints** are added to `EndpointSlices`, allocating endpoints to zones.
- **Note**: Before Kubernetes 1.27, this feature was controlled via the `service.kubernetes.io/topology-aware-hints` annotation.

#### Ideal Use Cases
Topology Aware Routing is most effective when:
1. **Traffic is evenly distributed** across zones.
2. **Service has 3+ endpoints per zone** (recommended 9+ endpoints for a 3-zone cluster).

### How It Works

**EndpointSlice Controller**
- **EndpointSlice**: The controller assigns a proportional number of endpoints to each zone based on CPU capacity, for example:
  - If Zone A has twice the CPU capacity as Zone B, Zone A will have twice as many endpoints assigned.
- Example `EndpointSlice` with hints:
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: discovery.k8s.io/v1
  kind: EndpointSlice
  metadata:
    name: example-hints
    labels:
      kubernetes.io/service-name: example-svc
  addressType: IPv4
  ports:
    - name: http
      protocol: TCP
      port: 80
  endpoints:
    - addresses: ["10.1.2.3"]
      conditions:
        ready: true
      hostname: pod-1
      zone: zone-a
      hints:
        forZones:
          - name: "zone-a"
  ```

**kube-proxy**
- Filters endpoints based on the **hints** set by the `EndpointSlice` controller to prioritize traffic within the same zone.
- Allocates endpoints from a different zone only when necessary for load balancing.

### Safeguards

The Kubernetes control plane and `kube-proxy` implement safeguards to avoid unexpected traffic issues:
1. **Insufficient Endpoints**: No hints assigned if endpoints are fewer than zones.
2. **Unbalanced Allocation**: No hints assigned if proportional distribution cannot be achieved.
3. **Incomplete Node Data**: Nodes lacking topology data (e.g., missing zone labels) result in no hints.
4. **Transition State**: If any endpoint lacks a zone hint, kube-proxy temporarily uses all endpoints.
5. **Unrepresented Zones**: If kube-proxy cannot find an endpoint for its zone, it routes traffic across zones.

### Constraints and Considerations

- **Internal Traffic Policy**: Topology Aware Hints are incompatible with `internalTrafficPolicy: Local`.
- **Uneven Traffic Distribution**: Works best when traffic aligns with the capacity distribution of nodes across zones.
- **Node Readiness**: Ignores unready nodes during endpoint allocation, which may affect zone balance.
- **Control Plane Nodes**: Ignores nodes labeled as control-plane or master, potentially impacting workloads on these nodes.
- **Tolerations**: The controller does not consider tolerations, which may limit routing accuracy.
- **Autoscaling Compatibility**: Topology Aware Routing may not align with Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) behavior, particularly if traffic concentrates in one zone.

### Custom Heuristics

As Kubernetes deployments vary widely, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to endpoint allocation across zones. Kubernetes 1.27 introduces initial support for **custom heuristics**, enabling more specialized routing based on custom needs.
