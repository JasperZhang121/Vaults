**Service Internal Traffic Policy** allows for routing internal traffic within the same node where it originates, <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">avoiding unnecessary routing through the cluster network</mark>. This can improve reliability, reduce latency, increase throughput, and lower costs by keeping traffic local.

### Feature Overview
- **Feature State**: Kubernetes v1.26 [stable]
- **Purpose**: Reduces cluster network load by routing internal traffic locally when possible.
- **Use Case**: Improves performance by keeping communication between Pods on the same node without involving the entire cluster network.

### Enabling Service Internal Traffic Policy

To enable internal-only traffic for a Service, set `.spec.internalTrafficPolicy` to `Local` in the Service specification. This instructs `kube-proxy` to restrict routing to node-local endpoints only for internal cluster traffic.

**Example**:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  selector:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: MyApp
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 9376
  internalTrafficPolicy: Local
```

> **Note**: If there are no local endpoints for a Service on a given node, the Service will behave as if it has zero endpoints on that node, even if there are endpoints available on other nodes.

### How It Works

1. **`kube-proxy` Filtering**: 
   - When `.spec.internalTrafficPolicy` is set to `Local`, `kube-proxy` filters and routes traffic to only node-local endpoints.
   - When set to `Cluster` (default) or left unset, `kube-proxy` considers all available endpoints across nodes for routing.

By choosing the `Local` policy, Kubernetes optimizes node-level communication by leveraging available local resources, thus reducing dependency on cross-node network resources.
