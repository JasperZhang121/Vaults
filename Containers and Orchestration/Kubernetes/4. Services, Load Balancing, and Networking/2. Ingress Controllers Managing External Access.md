For an Ingress resource to manage HTTP/HTTPS traffic in Kubernetes, an **Ingress Controller** must be running in the cluster. Unlike other controllers, Ingress controllers are not included by default in Kubernetes and need to be manually installed. The Kubernetes project supports some Ingress controllers, while others are provided by third parties.

### Supported and Common Ingress Controllers

1. **Supported by Kubernetes**:
   - **AWS Ingress Controller**: Manages Ingress resources for AWS load balancers.
   - **GCE Ingress Controller**: Configures Google Cloud Load Balancers.
   - **NGINX Ingress Controller**: Works with NGINX to manage Ingress rules.

2. **Additional Third-Party Ingress Controllers**:
   - **AKS Application Gateway Ingress**: Configures Azure Application Gateway.
   - **Alibaba Cloud MSE Ingress**: Integrates with Alibaba Cloud Native Gateway.
   - **Apache APISIX Ingress**: Uses Apache APISIX for Ingress management.
   - **Cilium Ingress**: Cilium-powered, designed for secure connectivity.
   - **Contour**: Envoy-based Ingress controller, ideal for L7 routing.
   - **Gloo**: Envoy-powered Ingress controller with API gateway functionality.
   - **Istio Ingress**: Integrated with Istio for service mesh routing.
   - **Kong Ingress**: Leverages Kong API Gateway for managing HTTP(S) traffic.
   - **Traefik Ingress**: Integrates with Traefik proxy, supporting various routing features.
   - **Voyager**: Ingress controller based on HAProxy for high-performance load balancing.

### Using Multiple Ingress Controllers

Kubernetes supports multiple Ingress controllers within a single cluster using **Ingress Classes**:

- **IngressClass Resource**: Define an IngressClass with `.metadata.name` to manage which controller applies to each Ingress.
- **Default IngressClass**: If only one IngressClass is marked as default (`ingressclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class` annotation set to "true"), it will automatically apply to any Ingress without a specified class.
  
For example:
- To use a specific Ingress controller, set the `ingressClassName` in your Ingress spec:
  ```yaml
  spec:
    ingressClassName: nginx-example
  ```
