The **Gateway API** is an extension in Kubernetes for <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">managing network services through dynamic infrastructure provisioning and advanced traffic routing</mark>. It provides a role-oriented, protocol-aware configuration mechanism and is set to replace the Ingress API for managing HTTP(S) traffic in Kubernetes clusters.

### Key Design Principles

1. **Role-Oriented**: Modeled around different organizational roles in Kubernetes networking:
   - **Infrastructure Provider**: Manages network infrastructure for isolated clusters (e.g., cloud providers).
   - **Cluster Operator**: Manages clusters, focusing on policies, network access, and application permissions.
   - **Application Developer**: Manages applications within clusters, focusing on service composition and configurations.

2. **Portable**: Defined as custom resources, Gateway API supports multiple implementations, allowing flexibility across providers.

3. **Expressive**: Supports advanced traffic routing features (header-based matching, traffic weighting) that were previously only available via custom annotations in Ingress.

4. **Extensible**: Enables linking of custom resources at various API layers, allowing for detailed customization.

### Core Resource Model

The Gateway API organizes its functions around three core API kinds:

1. **GatewayClass**:
   - Defines a set of gateways with shared configurations.
   - Managed by a specific controller implementing the class.

   Example:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
   kind: GatewayClass
   metadata:
     name: example-class
   spec:
     controllerName: example.com/gateway-controller
   ```

2. **Gateway**:
   - Represents an instance of traffic-handling infrastructure, like a cloud load balancer.
   - Specifies network endpoints for managing backend traffic.

   Example:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
   kind: Gateway
   metadata:
     name: example-gateway
   spec:
     gatewayClassName: example-class
     listeners:
     - name: http
       protocol: HTTP
       port: 80
   ```

3. **HTTPRoute**:
   - Defines HTTP-specific routing rules from a Gateway listener to backend services.

   Example:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
   kind: HTTPRoute
   metadata:
     name: example-httproute
   spec:
     parentRefs:
     - name: example-gateway
     hostnames:
     - "www.example.com"
     rules:
     - matches:
       - path:
           type: PathPrefix
           value: /login
       backendRefs:
       - name: example-svc
         port: 8080
   ```

   In this example, requests to `www.example.com/login` will be routed to `example-svc` on port `8080`.

### Request Flow Example

For a simple request flow using Gateway and HTTPRoute:

1. A client sends an HTTP request to `http://www.example.com`.
2. DNS resolves this to an IP assigned to the Gateway.
3. The reverse proxy (Gateway) matches the request's `Host` header and applies HTTPRoute rules, forwarding it to the designated backend.

### Migration from Ingress

**Gateway API** is intended to succeed the Ingress API. To transition from Ingress to Gateway API:
- Migrate Ingress resources to Gateway resources (refer to the ingress migration guide for details).

### Conformance Testing

The API's broad feature set requires strict conformance testing to ensure consistency across implementations. Conformance definitions and tests help maintain reliability regardless of the provider used.
