Kubernetes supports running nodes on both **Linux** and **Windows** within the same cluster. Below is an overview of networking on Windows, including container networking modes, supported network flows, IP address management, service configuration, load balancing, and current limitations.

### Container Networking on Windows
Networking for Windows containers is managed through **CNI plugins**, functioning similarly to virtual machines with each container having its own **vNIC** connected to a **Hyper-V virtual switch (vSwitch)**. The **Host Networking Service (HNS)** and **Host Compute Service (HCS)** are critical in container networking on Windows:
- **HCS**: Manages containers.
- **HNS**: Manages networking resources, including virtual networks, endpoints, policies, and NAT rules.
- Configurations for DNS, routes, and metrics are stored in the **Windows registry**, not in files like `/etc` as on Linux, so CNI plugins must interface with the HNS instead of using file mappings.

### Network Modes
Windows supports five networking modes for different use cases. The following table summarizes these modes and when each is suitable:

| **Network Mode** | **Description** | **Container Packet Modifications** | **Supported Plugins** | **Use Cases** |
|------------------|-----------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------|---------------|
| **L2bridge**    | Connects containers to an external vSwitch on the underlay network. | MAC rewritten to host MAC, IP may be rewritten. | `win-bridge`, `Azure-CNI`, `Flannel host-gateway` | Best for direct connection to underlay, requires user-defined routes. |
| **L2Tunnel**    | Variation of L2bridge specific to Azure; integrates with Azure Virtual Network (vNET). | MAC rewritten, IP visible. | `Azure-CNI` | Ideal for secure connections to Azure services. |
| **Overlay**     | Connects containers via VXLAN encapsulation. Each overlay network has a unique IP subnet. | Encapsulated with outer header. | `win-overlay`, `Flannel VXLAN` | Best for isolated virtual container networks. |
| **Transparent** | For specific use cases (e.g., OVN Kubernetes), connects containers to an external vSwitch. | Encapsulated via GENEVE or STT. | `ovn-kubernetes` | Suited for logical network communication with distributed ACLs. |
| **NAT**         | Provides vNIC to containers with internal vSwitch; used primarily for DNS/DHCP (not typical for Kubernetes). | MAC and IP rewritten. | `nat` | Basic internal networking mode. |

#### IP Address Management (IPAM)
Supported IPAM options on Windows include:
- **host-local**
- **azure-vnet-ipam** (only with `Azure-CNI`)
- **Windows Server IPAM** (fallback if no IPAM is specified)

### Supported Network Flows
Supported network flows for **TCP/UDP traffic** include:
- Pod-to-Pod (via IP or Name)
- Pod-to-Service (Cluster IP, PQDN, or FQDN)
- Pod-to-external destinations (IP or DNS)
- Node-to-Pod and Pod-to-Node communications

### Load Balancing and Services
Windows nodes support various **Service types** in Kubernetes:
- **NodePort**
- **ClusterIP**
- **LoadBalancer**
- **ExternalName**

**Service Configuration Options**:
- **Session Affinity**: Ensures client connections remain consistent; supported on Windows Server 2022.
- **Direct Server Return (DSR)**: Balances traffic directly to the Pod's IP; available on Windows Server 2019.
- **Preserve-Destination**: Retains virtual IP in packets reaching backend Pods.
- **IPv4/IPv6 Dual-Stack**: Supports parallel IPv4 and IPv6 traffic within the cluster.
- **Client IP Preservation**: Retains the source IP for incoming traffic.

**Limitations**:
- Known issues with **NodePort** Services and **Pod-to-Pod connectivity** with `l2bridge` on Windows Server 2022.
- **OS fixes** are required for certain functionalities; refer to [Microsoft GitHub Issues](https://github.com/microsoft/Windows-Containers/issues/204) for updates.

### Limitations of Windows Networking in Kubernetes
- **Unsupported Functionalities**:
  - **Host Networking Mode**
  - **Local NodePort Access** from the same node (other nodes or external clients are unaffected)
  - **More than 64 Backend Pods** for a single Service
  - **IPv6** for Pods connected to overlay networks
  - **ICMP** traffic for outbound communication
  - **Local Traffic Policy** in non-DSR mode
  
  **ICMP Limitations**:
  - Ping within the same network (Pod-to-Pod) works.
  - **Outbound ICMP** (e.g., Pod-to-Internet) is unsupported; use `curl <destination>` for testing connectivity.

- **Flannel VXLAN CNI Plugin Limitations**:
  - Only supports node-to-Pod connectivity locally.
  - Limited to **VNI 4096** and **UDP port 4789** for connectivity.
