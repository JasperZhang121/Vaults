In Kubernetes, Services provide a way to expose applications running on a set of Pods through a **ClusterIP**, which is a cluster-scoped virtual IP address. Kubernetes allocates ClusterIP addresses dynamically or statically and ensures each Service has a unique IP address within the cluster's configured range.

### ClusterIP Allocation Types
1. **Dynamic Allocation**: Kubernetes' control plane automatically assigns a free IP from the configured IP range for `ClusterIP` Services.
2. **Static Allocation**: You can specify a ClusterIP manually, as long as it’s within the cluster’s IP range.

> **Note**: If you try to create a Service with a ClusterIP that’s already in use, Kubernetes will return an error.

#### Reserving Service ClusterIPs
Certain Services, like the **DNS Service**, may need well-known IPs for consistency and accessibility. For instance, using `10.96.0.10` as the DNS Service IP allows other components and users in the cluster to use a familiar address. This requires ensuring the IP address isn’t dynamically assigned to another Service.

**Example for DNS Service with Static ClusterIP**:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: kube-dns
  namespace: kube-system
spec:
  clusterIP: 10.96.0.10
  ports:
  - name: dns
    port: 53
    protocol: UDP
    targetPort: 53
  - name: dns-tcp
    port: 53
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 53
  selector:
    k8s-app: kube-dns
  type: ClusterIP
```

#### Avoiding ClusterIP Conflicts
To reduce IP address conflicts, Kubernetes uses a range-based allocation strategy:
- **Range Division**: The IP range for ClusterIPs is divided into a **dynamic allocation band** and a **static allocation band**.
- **Dynamic Band**: Typically uses the upper portion of the IP range.
- **Static Band**: Uses the lower portion of the IP range, minimizing collision risks for statically assigned ClusterIPs.

The allocation formula:
- **Band Offset**: `min(max(16, cidrSize / 16), 256)` 
  - Ensures at least 16 IPs in the static range, up to a maximum of 256 IPs.

### Examples of ClusterIP Allocation

#### Example 1: IP Range `10.96.0.0/24`
- **Range Size**: `254 IPs`
- **Static Band**: `10.96.0.1` to `10.96.0.16`
- **Dynamic Band**: Starts from `10.96.0.17` to `10.96.0.254`

#### Example 2: IP Range `10.96.0.0/20`
- **Range Size**: `4094 IPs`
- **Static Band**: `10.96.0.1` to `10.96.1.0`
- **Dynamic Band**: Starts from `10.96.1.1` to `10.96.15.254`

#### Example 3: IP Range `10.96.0.0/16`
- **Range Size**: `65,534 IPs`
- **Static Band**: `10.96.0.1` to `10.96.1.0`
- **Dynamic Band**: Starts from `10.96.1.1` to `10.96.255.254`
