**DNS for Services and Pods** in Kubernetes provides a way for workloads to discover services using consistent DNS names instead of IP addresses, facilitating service discovery within the cluster. Kubernetes creates DNS records for Services and Pods, allowing workloads to access them by name.

### DNS for Services

1. **Service DNS Records**:
   - **Normal Services**: Assigned **A/AAAA records** (IPv4/IPv6) with a name format `my-svc.my-namespace.svc.cluster.local`, resolving to the Service’s cluster IP.
   - **Headless Services** (no cluster IP): Resolve to the IPs of all Pods matching the Service’s selector, enabling round-robin or client-side load balancing.
   - **SRV Records**: Created for named ports in both normal and headless services. The format is `_port-name._port-protocol.my-svc.my-namespace.svc.cluster.local`, resolving to either the Service’s IP or each Pod’s domain in headless mode.

2. **Namespace-Specific Queries**:
   - **Within Namespace**: DNS queries limited to the Pod’s namespace.
   - **Cross-Namespace Access**: Access Services in other namespaces by specifying `<service-name>.<namespace>`, e.g., `data.prod` for a Service named `data` in the `prod` namespace.

3. **DNS Search List Expansion**:
   - Pods’ `/etc/resolv.conf` includes DNS search paths based on the namespace and cluster domain. For example, the query `data` from a Pod in the `test` namespace expands to `data.test.svc.cluster.local`.

### DNS for Pods

1. **Pod DNS Records**:
   - Pods are assigned **A/AAAA records** if exposed by a Service, with the format `pod-ip.service-name.my-namespace.svc.cluster.local`.
   - Legacy resolution format for Pod IPs (e.g., `172-17-0-3.default.pod.cluster.local`) is retained for backward compatibility.

2. **Pod Hostname and Subdomain**:
   - **Hostname**: Default is `metadata.name`, but can be overridden in the Pod spec (`spec.hostname`).
   - **Subdomain**: Used to create a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) for Pods, with format `<hostname>.<subdomain>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local`.
   - **Headless Service with Subdomain**: Allows DNS records for individual Pods in the format `hostname.subdomain.namespace.svc.cluster.local`.

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Pod
   metadata:
     name: busybox1
   spec:
     hostname: busybox-1
     subdomain: busybox-subdomain
     containers:
       - image: busybox:1.28
   ```

### DNS Policy and Config

1. **Pod DNS Policy**:
   - **Default**: Inherits from the node’s DNS configuration.
   - **ClusterFirst**: Forwards non-cluster DNS queries to an upstream server. Default if `dnsPolicy` is unspecified.
   - **ClusterFirstWithHostNet**: For Pods using `hostNetwork`, requires setting this policy to maintain cluster DNS resolution.
   - **None**: Ignores Kubernetes DNS settings; user provides DNS configuration via `dnsConfig`.

2. **Custom DNS Config (`dnsConfig`)**:
   - Allows additional DNS customization in Pod spec.
   - Example:
     ```yaml
     dnsConfig:
       nameservers: [192.0.2.1]
       searches: [ns1.svc.cluster-domain.example]
       options:
         - name: ndots
           value: "2"
     ```

3. **FQDN for Hostname**:
   - Set `setHostnameAsFQDN: true` in the Pod spec to have the FQDN as the hostname. Limited to 64 characters; longer FQDNs will prevent Pod startup.

#### DNS on Windows Nodes

- Windows Pods support only one DNS suffix, based on the namespace (e.g., `default.svc.cluster.local`).
- For name resolution, Windows Pods use the **Resolve-DNSName** PowerShell cmdlet to avoid limitations with partially qualified names.

### Default Policy and DNS Config Limits

1. **Default DNS Policy**:
   - Pods in a namespace without specific policies inherit default DNS behaviors unless overridden.
2. **Search Domain Limits**:
   - Search domains limited to 32 entries or a maximum of 2048 characters in total across `/etc/resolv.conf`.
   - Container runtimes may impose additional restrictions, which could affect Pods with extensive DNS configuration (e.g., older `containerd` versions).

By enabling **DNS-based service discovery**, Kubernetes simplifies networking and connectivity for applications within the cluster, allowing Pods to resolve and communicate with Services and other Pods in a scalable and efficient manner.
