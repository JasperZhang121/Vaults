Kubernetes uses a layered approach to control API access, ensuring only authenticated and authorized users can interact with cluster resources. Access control follows these steps:

### 1. **Transport Security**

- **TLS Protection**: The Kubernetes API server, by default, listens on port 6443 (production clusters often use port 443) and is secured by TLS.
- **Configuration**:
  - **TLS Certificate**: The server presents a certificate, which may be signed by a private or recognized certificate authority (CA). The certificate can be specified with `--tls-cert-file` and `--tls-private-key-file` flags.
  - **Client Trust**: If using a private CA, clients must have a copy of the CA certificate configured in their kubeconfig to verify server authenticity.
  - **Client Certificates**: Clients can present their own TLS certificates for added security.

### 2. **Authentication**

Once transport security is established, requests proceed to the **Authentication** step:
  
- **Authentication Modules**: The API server uses authenticator modules like client certificates, passwords, tokens, bootstrap tokens, and JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) for service accounts.
- **Multiple Modules**: Multiple authenticators can be configured, processed in sequence until one succeeds.
- **Failure**: Unauthenticated requests return an HTTP 401 error.
  
Upon success, the user is identified by a **username** and **group memberships** (if available), which are passed to subsequent access control stages.

**Note**: Kubernetes does not store User objects. It treats usernames as opaque data for authentication and logging.

### 3. **Authorization**

After authentication, the request is **Authorized**:

- **Policy Check**: Authorization verifies if the authenticated user is permitted to perform the requested action on the specified resource.
- **Example**: If a policy grants user "bob" read access to Pods in the `projectCaribou` namespace, a request to read Pods in `projectCaribou` is authorized, but write requests or read requests for other namespaces are denied.
  
**Authorization Modules**:
- **Supported Modes**: ABAC, RBAC, and Webhook modes.
- **Multi-Module Processing**: If multiple modules are configured, Kubernetes checks each; if one authorizes the request, it proceeds. Otherwise, it is denied (HTTP 403).

### 4. **Admission Control**

After authorization, **Admission Controllers** can further evaluate and modify requests:

- **Functionality**: Admission controllers can reject or modify requests based on object content. They do not apply to read-only requests.
- **Order of Execution**: Multiple controllers are executed sequentially. If any controller rejects the request, it is immediately denied.
- **Defaults and Validation**: Controllers can set default values and validate API objects. Once passed, the request proceeds to the validation and storage stage.

For a list of available admission controllers, refer to **Admission Controllers**.

### 5. **Auditing**

Kubernetes **Auditing** maintains a chronological log of cluster activities:

- **Audit Logs**: Auditing records actions taken by users, applications, and the control plane, providing a security-relevant record of API interactions.
- **Configuration**: To enhance security and monitoring, auditing can be configured to capture details like user identity, request path, and status codes.
