This guide provides an overview of Linux kernel security features to help secure your Kubernetes workloads. These features enhance isolation, mitigate risks, and allow fine-grained control over resource access. Below is an outline of key security mechanisms and best practices for applying these constraints within Kubernetes.

### Key Security Features

#### 1. **Running Workloads Without Root Privileges**
   - **Description**: Set user and group IDs in the Pod manifest to prevent containers from running as the root user.
   - **Benefits**:
     - Limits privileges of workloads, reducing the potential for exploitation.
   - **Note**: Ensure that the assigned user/group has necessary permissions for application functionality.

#### 2. **seccomp (Secure Computing Mode)**
   - **Purpose**: Restricts system calls (syscalls) accessible from user space to the kernel, limiting processes to only necessary capabilities.
   - **Use**:
     - Default seccomp profiles apply to containers; custom profiles can be set for additional control.
     - Enable the `allowPrivilegeEscalation: false` setting to restrict processes from gaining new capabilities.
   - **Considerations**:
     - Managing custom seccomp profiles can be challenging at scale.
     - For more isolation, consider using sandboxes like gVisor, which may increase resource requirements but offer enhanced security.
   
#### 3. **AppArmor (Mandatory Access Control)**
   - **Purpose**: Limits program capabilities, focusing on resource access, networking, and file permissions to minimize the application’s attack surface.
   - **Use**:
     - Configure AppArmor profiles to set allowed resource access and run them in enforcing mode to block disallowed actions.
     - Profiles provide options for auditing by logging policy violations.
   - **Notes**:
     - Profiles are defined at the file path level, providing flexibility in resource access definitions.
   
#### 4. **SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux)**
   - **Purpose**: Uses labels and policies to control access to resources like files, ports, and processes.
   - **Use**:
     - Define security labels in the securityContext to apply SELinux policies.
     - Policies apply across the container’s lifecycle, enhancing control over access based on roles and contexts.
   - **Differences from AppArmor**:
     - AppArmor uses profiles; SELinux uses label-based policies.
     - SELinux identifies resources by inodes rather than file paths.

#### 5. **Comparing seccomp, AppArmor, and SELinux**
   - **seccomp**: Limits syscalls and minimizes kernel interaction.
   - **AppArmor**: Manages resource access by defining file paths, suitable for limiting program scope and improving audit logging.
   - **SELinux**: Enforces access control via labels and policies, effective for controlling access to broader resource sets.

### Summary Table of Features
| Security Feature | Description | How to Use | Example |
|------------------|-------------|------------|---------|
| **seccomp**      | Restricts syscalls, reducing system vulnerability. | Apply a seccomp profile in Pod specification. | Block `unshare` syscall to mitigate CVE-2022-0185. |
| **AppArmor**     | Confines applications to designated resources. | Load a profile in container spec. | Limit read-only programs from write access. |
| **SELinux**      | Restricts resource access via labels and policies. | Tag resources with labels in securityContext. | Block a container from external filesystem access. |


### Privileged Containers and Security Considerations

Privileged containers override most security constraints, gaining unrestricted capabilities:
   - **seccomp**: Defaults to an unconfined profile, ignoring specified security settings.
   - **AppArmor**: Disables applied profiles.
   - **SELinux**: Defaults to the unconfined_t domain.
   - **Best Practice**: Only enable privileged mode if necessary; grant specific capabilities through `securityContext.capabilities` instead.

### Recommendations for Security Hardening

1. **Network Isolation**: Use network policies as the first line of defense.
2. **Run as Non-root**: Set `runAsNonRoot: true` in the Pod specification to enforce non-root execution.
3. **User Namespaces**: For running root in the user namespace but as non-root in the host, use `hostUsers: false`.
