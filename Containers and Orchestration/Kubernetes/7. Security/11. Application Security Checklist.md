This checklist provides guidelines for enhancing the security of applications deployed in Kubernetes, specifically from a developer's perspective. It covers base hardening practices, pod-level security configurations, RBAC guidelines, and network policies.

### 1. **Base Security Hardening**

   - **Application Design**
     - Apply security principles in application design.
     - Set **QoS classes** through resource requests and limits for reliable performance.
     - Define **memory limits** at or below memory requests.
     - Set **CPU limits** on sensitive workloads if needed.

   - **Service Account**
     - Create unique **ServiceAccounts** per workload or microservice.
     - Set `automountServiceAccountToken: false` unless the pod requires Kubernetes API access.

   - **Pod-level Security Context**
     - Set `runAsNonRoot: true` to ensure the container does not run as root.
     - Configure **user and group IDs** (e.g., `runAsUser`, `runAsGroup`) for less privileged operations.
     - Assign a supplementary group via `fsGroup` for persistent volume access.
     - Deploy applications in namespaces enforcing **Pod Security Standards** or document security measures if not controlled by the cluster.

   - **Container-level Security Context**
     - Set `allowPrivilegeEscalation: false` to prevent privilege escalation.
     - Use `readOnlyRootFilesystem: true` for a read-only root file system.
     - Avoid privileged containers by setting `privileged: false`.
     - **Drop unnecessary capabilities** and add only those required by the container.


### 2. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**

   - **Permissions Management**
     - Limit permissions like **create, patch, update, and delete** to essential roles only.
     - Avoid permissions to create or modify roles, as these can lead to **privilege escalation**.
     - Review and remove `system:unauthenticated` group bindings if possible to limit broad access.

   - **Advanced Permissions**
     - For sensitive workloads, consider **ValidatingAdmissionPolicy** to control write actions more tightly.


### 3. **Image Security**

   - **Image Scanning**
     - **Scan container images** for vulnerabilities before deployment.
   - **Image Signing**
     - Validate the **container image signature** to ensure authenticity before deploying.


### 4. **Network Policies**

   - **Ingress and Egress Policies**
     - Define **NetworkPolicies** to control ingress and egress traffic, limiting exposure to only expected sources and destinations.
     - If deploying to multiple clusters, ensure **NetworkPolicy availability and enforcement**.


### 5. **Advanced Security Hardening**

   - **Linux Container Security**
     - Configure **Seccomp** profiles for syscall restrictions.
     - Apply **AppArmor** policies for additional confinement.
     - Assign **SELinux labels** for mandatory access control.

   - **Runtime Classes**
     - Set **RuntimeClasses** for containers needing specialized isolation levels.
     - For sensitive workloads, consider **gVisor** for syscall interception or **Kata Containers** for virtualized isolation.
     - For high-trust environments, explore **confidential virtual machines** for enhanced security.
