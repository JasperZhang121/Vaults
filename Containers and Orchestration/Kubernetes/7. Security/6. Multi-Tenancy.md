Multi-tenancy allows shared use of Kubernetes clusters, improving cost-efficiency and simplifying administration while also raising challenges in security, isolation, and fair resource management. This guide explores configurations, best practices, and implementations for cluster multi-tenancy.

### Use Cases

1. **Multiple Teams**: 
   - Often within a single organization, teams share clusters and deploy workloads needing inter-communication.
   - Typically, team members access Kubernetes resources directly through `kubectl` or indirectly via GitOps. Essential policies for multi-team environments include **RBAC**, **resource quotas**, and **network policies**.

2. **Multiple Customers (SaaS)**:
   - Common in Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), where clusters host multiple, isolated instances of applications for different customers.
   - Customers have no access to the cluster; only the vendor uses Kubernetes for workload management.


### Key Terminology

1. **Tenants**: Defined by the sharing model:
   - **Multi-Team**: A tenant represents a team that manages workloads within a cluster.
   - **Multi-Customer**: Tenants are customers or groups sharing application instances.
   - Hybrid architectures are possible, where both models coexist for different services within the same cluster.

2. **Isolation Types**:
   - **Hard Multi-Tenancy**: Strong isolation suited for untrusted tenants, preventing data leaks and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.
   - **Soft Multi-Tenancy**: Weaker isolation for trusted tenants, reducing operational complexity.

### Isolation Techniques

#### Control Plane Isolation

1. **Namespaces**:
   - Segregates resources and allows reuse of names.
   - Ensures tenants are isolated through namespace-specific RBAC policies and network policies.
   - Namespace per workload or tenant provides logical separation, making resource management and security easier.

2. **Access Controls (RBAC)**:
   - The "Principle of Least Privilege" should guide access restrictions, only allowing tenants necessary permissions.
   - **Roles** and **RoleBindings** enforce access within specific namespaces, and **ClusterRoles** limit access at the cluster level.

3. **Quotas**:
   - Resource quotas control resource allocation, ensuring no tenant can monopolize resources and cause “noisy neighbor” issues.
   - Namespace-level quotas can limit Pods, ConfigMaps, and CPU/memory usage for each tenant.

#### Data Plane Isolation

1. **Network Isolation**:
   - Network policies restrict pod-to-pod communication within namespaces or IP address ranges.
   - Service meshes can offer additional network layer security with mutual TLS and workload-based identity policies.

2. **Storage Isolation**:
   - Dynamic volume provisioning with **StorageClasses** can limit storage access to tenant-specific volumes.
   - Set reclaim policies to `Delete` on shared storage to prevent data leakage across namespaces.

3. **Sandboxing Containers**:
   - Sandboxing isolates container workloads, ideal for running untrusted code.
   - Implementations include:
     - **gVisor**: Intercepts system calls with a userspace kernel.
     - **Kata Containers**: Provides VM-level isolation for each container.

4. **Node Isolation**:
   - Dedicated nodes for each tenant prevent resource conflicts and contain any security incidents within a single tenant’s environment.
   - Techniques include using **node selectors**, **taints**, **tolerations**, and **node affinity**.

### Additional Considerations

1. **API Priority and Fairness**:
   - Prioritizes requests based on importance, ensuring critical services aren't blocked by high-volume, lower-priority requests.

2. **Quality-of-Service (QoS)**:
   - Offers tenants different service levels (e.g., premium or freemium) using storage classes, network QoS, and pod priority/preemption policies.

3. **DNS Management**:
   - DNS controls can limit cross-namespace lookups for security, using tools like CoreDNS to restrict lookups within namespaces.

4. **Operators**:
   - Operators in multi-tenant environments should support multi-namespace operations, resource requests/limits, and data-plane isolation.

### Implementation Options

1. **Namespace per Tenant**:
   - **Hierarchical Namespace Controller (HNC)**: Organizes namespaces into hierarchies, managing policies across tenant namespaces.
   - Namespace-based tenancy is cost-effective but requires additional configuration for resources like CRDs and webhooks.

2. **Virtual Control Plane per Tenant**:
   - Each tenant has a dedicated control plane, increasing isolation while allowing shared worker nodes.
   - Managed by the **Cluster API - Nested (CAPN)** or **Kamaji** projects, this setup suits cases where tenants need access to Kubernetes APIs.
