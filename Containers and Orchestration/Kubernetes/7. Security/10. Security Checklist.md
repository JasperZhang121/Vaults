This checklist provides foundational security guidance for securing Kubernetes clusters. It includes critical areas such as authentication, network security, pod security, secret management, and image handling. 

### 1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - **Do not use `system:masters`** for user or component authentication after setup.
   - Enable **service account credentials** for `kube-controller-manager`.
   - Ensure the **root certificate is protected** and has a limited lifespan.
   - Conduct **access reviews** every 24 months or less.
   - Implement **RBAC Good Practices** to limit access based on roles and ensure the principle of least privilege.

### 2. **Network Security**
   - **CNI Plugins** must support network policies.
   - Enforce **ingress and egress policies** for all workloads.
   - Apply **default deny-all policies** within each namespace.
   - **Service mesh** is recommended for in-cluster encryption if CNI lacks it.
   - Avoid exposing **Kubernetes API, kubelet API, and etcd** to the internet.
   - Restrict **metadata API access** from workloads.
   - Limit **LoadBalancer and ExternalIPs** usage to avoid risks such as CVE-2020-8554.

### 3. **Pod Security**
   - Grant **RBAC rights to create/update workloads** only when necessary.
   - Apply **Pod Security Standards** at namespace level (privileged, baseline, restricted).
   - Set **memory and CPU limits** to mitigate DoS risks.
   - Enable **seccomp** with syscall restrictions and **AppArmor/SELinux** profiles where supported.
   - For enhanced security, use the **Pod Security Admission Controller** to enforce standards.

### 4. **Logs and Auditing**
   - **Audit logs** should be enabled and protected from unauthorized access to track events within the cluster.

### 5. **Pod Placement**
   - **Separate nodes by sensitivity** tiers (e.g., isolate sensitive applications).
   - Use **Node Selectors, PodTolerationRestriction, and RuntimeClass** for node isolation based on workload sensitivity.

### 6. **Secrets Management**
   - Store confidential data in **Kubernetes Secrets**, not in ConfigMaps.
   - Enable **encryption at rest** for Secrets in etcd.
   - Inject secrets from third-party storage solutions as volumes if required.
   - Avoid mounting **service account tokens** in Pods that donâ€™t need them.
   - Use **Bound Service Account Token Volume** for expiring credentials.

### 7. **Container Images**
   - Keep images **minimal**, excluding unnecessary tools like shells and debugging utilities.
   - Configure images to **run as unprivileged** users by default.
   - Reference images by **sha256 digest** to ensure image immutability.
   - Regularly **scan container images** for vulnerabilities as part of deployment workflows.

### 8. **Admission Controllers**
   - Enable a **selection of admission controllers** that align with security policies.
   - Use **Pod Security Admission** or webhook admission controllers for Pod security policies.
   - Review the following categories of admission controllers:
      - **Default Enabled Controllers**: For core security functionality (e.g., `LimitRanger`, `ResourceQuota`).
      - **Recommended Additional Controllers**: `DenyServiceExternalIPs`, `NodeRestriction` to limit external IP risks and kubelet permissions.
      - **Optional Controllers**: `AlwaysPullImages` to enforce the latest image version and `ImagePolicyWebhook` for custom image controls.
