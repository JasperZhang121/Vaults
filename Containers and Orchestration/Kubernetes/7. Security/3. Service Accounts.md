Service accounts in Kubernetes provide a unique identity to applications or entities within a cluster, enabling secure access to resources. Service accounts are particularly useful for Pods and automation tasks requiring Kubernetes API access.

### 1. **What Are Service Accounts?**

- **Purpose**: Service accounts represent non-human identities that allow Pods and components to interact with the Kubernetes API or external services securely.
- **Properties**:
  - **Namespaced**: Each service account is tied to a specific namespace.
  - **Lightweight**: Defined in the Kubernetes API, service accounts are easy to create.
  - **Portable**: They are included within configuration bundles for easy deployment and replication.
  
**Note**: Service accounts differ from user accounts, which represent human identities. User accounts are typically managed outside Kubernetes, while service accounts exist within Kubernetes as objects.


### 2. **Default Service Accounts**

- **Automatic Creation**: Kubernetes automatically creates a default service account in each namespace with limited permissions.
- **Assignment**: If no service account is specified for a Pod, Kubernetes assigns the namespace's default service account to it.
  

### 3. **Use Cases for Service Accounts**

- **API Access**: Pods requiring interaction with the Kubernetes API, such as reading Secrets or managing resources across namespaces.
- **External Services**: Service accounts can facilitate secure communication between a Pod and external APIs (e.g., cloud provider APIs).
- **CI/CD**: Service accounts can authenticate external services (e.g., CI/CD tools) with the Kubernetes API.
- **Security Contexts**: Security software can use service accounts to group Pods based on their identity.


### 4. **Using Service Accounts**

- **Creating a Service Account**: Create a ServiceAccount object using `kubectl` or a YAML manifest.
- **Granting Permissions**: Use RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) to assign minimal necessary permissions to each service account.
- **Assigning to Pods**: Assign a ServiceAccount to a Pod by setting `spec.serviceAccountName` in the Pod specification.
- **External Service Usage**: Retrieve and use the ServiceAccount token outside the cluster as needed.


### 5. **Grant Permissions with RBAC**

- **RBAC Binding**: Assign roles to service accounts with minimum permissions needed for their tasks, ensuring least-privilege access.
- **Cross-Namespace Access**: Grant access across namespaces by binding roles in the target namespace to a service account from another namespace.


### 6. **Assigning a Service Account to a Pod**

- **Automatic Token Injection**: In Kubernetes v1.22+, the TokenRequest API provides short-lived tokens mounted as a projected volume in the Pod.
- **Disabling Automatic Injection**: Set `automountServiceAccountToken: false` in the Pod specification to disable token injection.
  

### 7. **Retrieving Service Account Credentials**

- **TokenRequest API** (Recommended): Generates short-lived tokens that rotate automatically.
- **Token Volume Projection** (Recommended): Adds the token as a projected volume, providing expiry and rotation benefits.
- **Service Account Token Secrets** (Not Recommended): Provides long-lived, static tokens as Secrets, which have security risks due to lack of rotation.


### 8. **Restricting Access to Secrets**

Add the annotation `kubernetes.io/enforce-mountable-secrets: "true"` to enforce access controls on the secrets associated with a ServiceAccount.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/enforce-mountable-secrets: "true"
  name: my-serviceaccount
  namespace: my-namespace
```


### 9. **Authenticating Service Account Credentials**

Service accounts use JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) to authenticate with the API server. Authentication steps include checking the token's signature, expiration, and audience claims.

**Recommended Methods**:
- **TokenReview API**: Validates tokens and invalidates them if associated resources (e.g., Pods) are deleted.
- **OIDC Discovery**: Useful for integrating with OpenID Connect providers.


### 10. **Alternatives to Service Accounts**

- **Custom Tokens**: Use Webhook Token Authentication for validating custom tokens.
- **SPIFFE and SPIRE**: Use SPIFFE SVIDs for certificate-based identity in Pods.
- **Service Meshes**: Tools like Istio can provide certificates for identity management.
- **External Authentication**: Authenticate to the Kubernetes API without service account tokens, such as through OpenID Connect, IAM services, or client certificates.
