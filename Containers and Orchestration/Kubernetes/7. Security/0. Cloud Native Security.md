### 1. **Cloud Native Information Security**

#### **Develop Phase**
- **Objectives**:
  - Protect development environments and code integrity.
  - Design applications with secure architecture, like **zero trust**.
  - Integrate user security into the solution design.
- **Best Practices**:
  - Establish **code review** processes with security considerations.
  - Use **threat models** to identify risks and mitigate them effectively.
  - Integrate **security automation** (e.g., fuzzing, chaos engineering).

#### **Distribute Phase**
- **Objectives**:
  - Secure the **supply chain** for container images and other artifacts.
  - Encrypt software distribution and verify **chain of trust**.
- **Best Practices**:
  - **Scan images** for vulnerabilities and use **private registries**.
  - Employ **digital certificates** to authenticate artifacts.
  - Update dependencies promptly in response to security alerts.

#### **Deploy Phase**
- **Objectives**:
  - Restrict deployment access and ensure **cryptographic verification** of image identity.
  - Provide a secure **runtime environment** for applications through Kubernetes.
  

### 2. **Runtime Lifecycle Protection**

#### **Access Protection**
- **API Security**: Ensure Kubernetes API security via **TLS** for all traffic and protected encryption keys.
- **Authentication and Authorization**:
  - Use **ServiceAccounts** for workload identities.
  - Implement effective **API access controls**.
- **Certificate Management**: Securely manage **CertificateSigningRequests** to prevent unauthorized use.

#### **Compute Protection**
- **Container Isolation**:
  - Enforce **Pod security standards** to minimize privileges.
  - Run container workloads on a **minimal, container-optimized OS** for reduced attack surfaces.
- **Resource Management**:
  - Define **ResourceQuotas** and **LimitRanges** to control resource usage.
  - Use **node isolation** for different trust-level workloads.
- **Security Modules** (Linux): Utilize **AppArmor** or **seccomp** for additional runtime restrictions.

#### **Storage Protection**
- **Data Security**:
  - Enable **encryption at rest** for API objects and storage volumes.
  - Backup data regularly and test recovery procedures.
- **Authentication for Storage**: Verify connections between nodes and storage.
- **Encryption Key Management**: Utilize hardware security modules for secure key generation.


### 3. **Networking and Security**

- **Network Policies**: Use **NetworkPolicy** or a **service mesh** to control network traffic within the cluster.
- **Encryption for In-Transit Data**: Consider network plugins that support **VPN overlays** or other encryption technologies to protect inter-node communication.


### 4. **Observability and Runtime Security**

- **Monitoring and Observability**:
  - Deploy monitoring tools like metrics dashboards while securing the data flow chain.
- **Security Logging**:
  - Implement **tamper-proof and encrypted logs** for incident resilience.
- **Sub-Kubernetes Security**:
  - Utilize **measured boot** or authenticated time distribution to ensure system integrity.
