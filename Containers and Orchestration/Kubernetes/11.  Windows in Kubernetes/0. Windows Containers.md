Windows containers enable organizations to manage Windows-based applications using Kubernetes, allowing a unified orchestration system across Linux and Windows environments.

### Windows Nodes in Kubernetes Clusters

- **Windows Node Support**: To run Windows containers, add Windows nodes to a Kubernetes cluster.
- **Cluster Requirements**:
  - Control plane must run on Linux.
  - Windows nodes are supported on **Windows Server 2019** or **Windows Server 2022**.
- **Container Type**: Kubernetes supports **Windows containers with process isolation** (no Hyper-V isolation support).

### Compatibility and Limitations

- **Unsupported Features**:
  - HugePages and privileged containers.
  - Some shared namespaces and termination grace period features.
  - Not all Kubernetes features (e.g., security context fields) are available for Windows containers.
- **OS Version Compatibility**: Kubernetes supports Windows Server LTSC releases like Windows Server 2019 and 2022, and SAC releases such as Windows Server 20H2.

### Key Concepts for Windows vs. Linux

#### Pods

- **Pod Structure**: Single or multiple containers per Pod; Windows and Linux containers cannot be mixed in the same Pod.
- **Supported Pod Features**:
  - Volume sharing, probes, `ConfigMap`, and `Secrets`.
  - `emptyDir` volumes, named pipe host mounts, and `OS` field set to Windows.
- **Unsupported Fields in Windows Pods**:
  - `spec.hostPID`, `spec.hostIPC`, security context fields, and process namespaces.

#### Workload Resources

- Workload types like **ReplicaSet**, **Deployment**, **StatefulSet**, **DaemonSet**, **Job**, and **CronJob** are supported for Windows nodes.

#### Kubernetes CLI and kubelet Differences

- Windows-specific command-line options include `--windows-priorityclass` for kubelet scheduling.
- **Unsupported**: Memory or CPU restrictions for kubelet on Windows nodes.

### API Compatibility and Field Differences

Due to OS differences, some Kubernetes APIs work differently for Windows:

- **File Systems**: Windows uses ACLs (Access Control Lists) instead of Linux's UID and GID permissions.
- **Security Context Fields**: Not all security features are available (e.g., `runAsGroup`, `procMount`).
- **Volume Compatibility**: Memory-backed volumes (`emptyDir`) and certain mount propagation settings are unavailable for Windows.

### Supported Container Runtimes for Windows

- **ContainerD** (v1.4.0+): Stable support for Windows.
- **Mirantis Container Runtime** (MCR): Available for Windows Server 2019+.
  - Refer to documentation for installation details and any specific limitations with GMSA.

### Hardware Recommendations for Windows Nodes

- Recommended: 64-bit processor with 4+ cores, 8GB+ RAM, and 50GB+ disk space.
- **Windows Container Image Sizes**: Typically larger than Linux, ranging from 300MB to over 10GB.

### Troubleshooting and Help

- **Logs**: Logs are essential for troubleshooting; refer to the SIG Windows contributing guide for log gathering.
- **Validation**: Use the Windows Operational Readiness specification and test suite to ensure hybrid (Windows and Linux) cluster functionality.

### Additional Resources

- **Deployment Tools**: `kubeadm` for cluster setup, and the Kubernetes Cluster API project for Windows node automation.
- **Distribution Channels**: Windows distribution models can be found in Microsoftâ€™s Windows Server servicing channels documentation.

Windows integration with Kubernetes enhances flexibility, enabling centralized container orchestration for both Linux and Windows applications across hybrid cloud environments.
