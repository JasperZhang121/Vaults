API Priority and Fairness (APF) provides granular control over request handling in the Kubernetes API server, preventing critical requests from being delayed during high traffic. It offers priority-based queuing and flow control beyond basic rate-limiting flags like `--max-requests-inflight` and `--max-mutating-requests-inflight`.

### 1. **Enabling API Priority and Fairness**

- **Default Status**: Enabled by default since Kubernetes v1.29.
- **Flags**:
  - Enable: `--enable-priority-and-fairness=true`
  - Disable: `--enable-priority-and-fairness=false`
- **API Versions**:
  - Stable v1 (default)
  - Deprecated: v1beta3 (can be disabled using `--runtime-config=flowcontrol.apiserver.k8s.io/v1beta3=false`)

### 2. **Concepts in APF**

- **Priority Levels**: Control the concurrency limits per priority, isolating different traffic types.
- **FlowSchemas**: Classify requests into flows and assign each flow to a priority level.
- **Concurrency Management**:
  - Requests consume "seats" within the priority level.
  - Some requests (e.g., large list requests) may occupy multiple seats.

### 3. **Managing Requests and Queuing**

- **Flow Isolation**: Uses fair queuing to prevent one flow from overwhelming others at the same priority.
- **Shuffle Sharding**: A queuing technique that minimizes the risk of collisions among flows.
- **Exempt Requests**: Some essential requests bypass APF, ensuring theyâ€™re not delayed.

### 4. **Configuration Objects**

- **PriorityLevelConfiguration**: Defines concurrency limits and queuing behavior for each priority level.
- **FlowSchema**: Matches requests based on specific rules and assigns them to priority levels.

### 5. **Default Configuration**

- **Mandatory Configurations**: Built-in objects that enforce basic guardrails.
  - **Exempt Level**: Allows immediate processing of certain system requests (e.g., from `system:masters`).
  - **Catch-all Level**: Minimal concurrency for unmatched requests.
- **Suggested Configuration**: Provides six priority levels:
  - Examples: `node-high`, `system`, `leader-election`, `workload-high`, `workload-low`, `global-default`
  
### 6. **Best Practices for APF Configuration**

- **Workload Adjustments**:
  - Limit request rates and avoid high concurrency with expensive requests (e.g., replace frequent `list` requests with `watch`).
- **Priority Adjustments**:
  - **Increase seats** for high-priority requests.
  - **Isolate non-essential traffic** using custom FlowSchemas and PriorityLevelConfigurations.

### 7. **Monitoring APF with Metrics**

APF adds observability metrics for monitoring request handling and performance. Key metrics include:

- **Rejection and Queue Metrics**:
  - `apiserver_flowcontrol_rejected_requests_total`: Counts rejected requests.
  - `apiserver_flowcontrol_current_inqueue_requests`: Number of queued requests.
- **Concurrency Metrics**:
  - `apiserver_flowcontrol_current_executing_requests`: Active requests.
  - `apiserver_flowcontrol_request_wait_duration_seconds`: Measures queue latency.

### 8. **Observability and Tuning**

- **Use Metrics**: Monitor APF metrics to detect throttling and optimize for better performance.
- **Isolation via FlowSchemas**: Customize FlowSchemas to isolate traffic, e.g., setting precedence to ensure specific service accounts or namespaces are processed separately.
