Kubernetes logging captures application activity, aiding debugging and monitoring within the cluster. With native support for log handling at the container and node levels, Kubernetes enables a structured approach to log collection, storage, and rotation but requires additional solutions for long-term storage and management.

### 1. **Application Logging Basics**

Applications often log to **standard output** and **standard error**. In Kubernetes, logs are typically accessed through `kubectl logs` commands:

```yaml
kubectl logs <pod-name>
```

- **Multi-container Pod Logging**: Specify a container with `-c` to retrieve specific logs.
- **Previous Logs**: Access logs from a previous container instantiation using `--previous`.

For consistent access, logs must be independent of the node or container lifecycle, achieved through **cluster-level logging** using separate backends.


### 2. **Node-Level Logging**

#### **Container Log Handling**
- **CRI Logging Format**: Kubernetes supports container logs using the Container Runtime Interface (CRI).
- **Kubelet Role**: The kubelet manages log rotation and directory structure, storing logs by default in `/var/log/pods`.
- **Log Rotation**:
  - Configurable via `containerLogMaxSize` (default 10Mi) and `containerLogMaxFiles` (default 5).
  - Additional parameters like `containerLogMaxWorkers` optimize rotation in high-log environments.

**Example**:
- For logs capped at 10MiB, `kubectl logs` only retrieves the latest rotated file content.

#### **System Component Logs**
Kubernetes differentiates logs by component type:
- **Non-containerized Components** (e.g., kubelet): On Linux, these logs are in `journald` or `/var/log`.
- **Containerized Components** (e.g., scheduler): Logs are in `/var/log`, and configuration for persistent storage is required.

Caution: Adjusting `podLogsDir` from `/var/log/pods` can disrupt expected paths for logs.


### 3. **Cluster-Level Logging Architectures**

Without native cluster-level storage, Kubernetes supports various logging architectures:

#### **Node-Level Logging Agent**
- Runs as a **DaemonSet** on each node, collecting logs across containers.
- Agents capture logs from `stdout` and `stderr` for storage or further processing.

#### **Sidecar Logging Configurations**
- **Streaming Sidecar**: Each sidecar streams specific log files to `stdout`.
- **Agent-Based Sidecar**: Configures a logging agent like Fluentd for specialized log handling.

**Example**:
```yaml
# Pod with two log streams managed by sidecars
spec:
  containers:
    - name: count-log-1
      args: ['tail -n+1 -F /var/log/1.log']
    - name: count-log-2
      args: ['tail -n+1 -F /var/log/2.log']
```

#### **Direct Application Logging**
Applications push logs to external backends, but this approach is less integrated with Kubernetes.


### 4. **Log Storage, Rotation, and Configuration**

#### **System and Pod Logs**
- **Linux Nodes**: System components often log to `journald`; if unavailable, logs default to `/var/log`.
- **Rotation for Shared Directories**: Managed automatically by some OSes or requires custom handling.

#### **Log Retention & Management**
For long-term log retention, configure external storage, especially when sharing `/var/log` across multiple components.

Kubernetes does not manage external log rotation for volumes, leaving customization to the administrator.
