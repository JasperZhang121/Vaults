Kubernetes tracing provides insights into latency and interdependencies within a cluster by recording trace spans for operations across system components. OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) with gRPC exporters facilitates trace exportation, typically collected and processed via an OpenTelemetry Collector.

### 1. **Trace Collection**

- **Protocol and Exporter**: Kubernetes components emit traces using OTLP, often with the gRPC exporter, on port 4317 by default.
- **OpenTelemetry Collector**: The collector aggregates, processes, and routes traces to tracing backends.
- **Direct Backend Export**: Optionally, traces can be directly sent to a trace backend by specifying the endpoint in the Kubernetes tracing configuration, removing the need for a collector.
- **Configuration Example**:
    ```yaml
    receivers:
      otlp:
        protocols:
          grpc:
    exporters:
      logging:
        logLevel: debug
    service:
      pipelines:
        traces:
          receivers: [otlp]
          exporters: [logging]
    ```

- **Environment Variables**:
  - **OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS**: Set header configurations (e.g., for authentication).
  - **OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES**: Configure resource attributes like cluster name, namespace, Pod name, etc.

### 2. **Component-Specific Tracing**

#### **kube-apiserver Traces**

- **Description**: Generates spans for incoming HTTP requests and outgoing requests to webhooks, `etcd`, and other services.
- **Trace Context**: Propagates the W3C Trace Context with outgoing requests but does not utilize incoming request trace contexts.
- **Configuration**:
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
    kind: TracingConfiguration
    # endpoint: localhost:4317 (default)
    samplingRatePerMillion: 100
    ```
  - **Sampling Rate**: Set `samplingRatePerMillion` to adjust the frequency of spans (e.g., `100` records 1 in 10,000 requests).

#### **kubelet Traces**

- **Feature State**: Enabled by default (Kubernetes v1.27 [beta])
- **Trace Generation**: Captures spans from gRPC methods, CRI interface, and pod synchronization.
- **Trace Context**: Propagates trace context with gRPC requests, establishing parent-child links between kubelet and container runtimes (e.g., CRI-O, containerd).
- **Configuration**:
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: kubelet.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
    kind: KubeletConfiguration
    featureGates:
      KubeletTracing: true
    tracing:
      # endpoint: localhost:4317 (default)
      samplingRatePerMillion: 100
    ```
  - **Sampling Rate**: Setting `samplingRatePerMillion` to 1,000,000 will capture every request.
  - **Performance Note**: Higher sampling rates increase CPU and network usage; adjust `samplingRatePerMillion` as needed.

### 3. **Stability Considerations**

- **Active Development**: Tracing instrumentation for Kubernetes is still evolving, with possible changes to span names, attributes, and endpoints.
- **Backward Compatibility**: Until tracing becomes stable, there is no backward compatibility guarantee for tracing instrumentation configurations and implementations.
