Kubernetes v1.31 introduces an alpha feature for **Coordinated Leader Election** among control plane components, ensuring that a designated leader is selected deterministically. This mechanism is designed to support Kubernetes version skew constraints during cluster upgrades.

#### Overview

- **Selection Strategy**: Kubernetes uses the **OldestEmulationVersion** strategy, prioritizing leaders based on:
  1. Emulation version (lowest).
  2. Binary version.
  3. Creation timestamp.

This coordinated approach ensures a stable leadership structure, especially helpful during upgrades or when managing multi-version clusters.

### Enabling Coordinated Leader Election

To enable this feature, ensure the following:

1. **Feature Gate**: Start the API Server with the `CoordinatedLeaderElection` feature gate enabled.
   - Set flag: `--feature-gates="CoordinatedLeaderElection=true"`
2. **API Group**: Enable the `coordination.k8s.io/v1alpha1` API group.
   - Set flag: `--runtime-config="coordination.k8s.io/v1alpha1=true"`

### Component Configuration

With the **CoordinatedLeaderElection** feature gate and **coordination.k8s.io/v1alpha1** API group enabled:

- **Control Plane Components**: Compatible control plane components, such as **kube-controller-manager** and **kube-scheduler**, will automatically utilize coordinated leader election.
- **Leader Election Method**: Components make use of the `LeaseCandidate` and `Lease` APIs to elect a leader as required.

This configuration provides efficient leader selection, improving reliability and stability in control plane operations.
