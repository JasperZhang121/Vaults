Add-ons enhance Kubernetes functionality and cater to specific needs like networking, visualization, and service discovery. Many are developed by third parties, and Kubernetes is not responsible for these projects. Here’s a categorized overview of some prominent add-ons, their functions, and setup.

### 1. **Networking and Network Policy**

Add-ons under networking allow the configuration and management of network connections, policies, and integrations with third-party networking platforms. 

- **ACI**: Cisco’s ACI for container networking and network security.
- **Antrea**: Layer 3/4 networking and security using Open vSwitch. (CNCF Sandbox Project)
- **Calico**: Network policy and networking provider supporting both overlay and non-overlay networks.
- **Canal**: Combines Flannel and Calico to provide network and policy support.
- **Cilium**: Provides networking, observability, and security with an eBPF-based data plane, and supports multiple clusters with an identity-based security model. (CNCF Graduated Project)
- **CNI-Genie**: Connects to various CNI plugins (e.g., Calico, Canal). (CNCF Sandbox Project)
- **Contiv**: Offers L2, L3, and overlay networks with policy frameworks.
- **Contrail (Tungsten Fabric)**: A multi-cloud network virtualization platform supporting Kubernetes, OpenShift, OpenStack, and Mesos.
- **Flannel**: Overlay network provider.
- **Gateway API**: Provides a role-based API for modeling service networking.
- **Knitter**: Supports multiple network interfaces within a pod.
- **Multus**: Multi-network support for Kubernetes, compatible with various CNI plugins.
- **OVN-Kubernetes**: Networking provider using OVN from Open vSwitch.
- **Nodus**: CNI controller for Service Function Chaining (SFC) based on OVN.
- **NSX-T Container Plug-in (NCP)**: Integrates VMware NSX-T with Kubernetes.
- **Nuage**: SDN platform enabling policy-based networking for Kubernetes and non-Kubernetes environments.
- **Romana**: Layer 3 networking solution with NetworkPolicy API support.
- **Spiderpool**: Supports underlay networking and RDMA for bare metal, VMs, and public cloud.
- **Weave Net**: Overlay network that continues to function across network partitions without external databases.

### 2. **Service Discovery**

Tools to help services find each other within the cluster.

- **CoreDNS**: A DNS server within Kubernetes, flexible and extensible.

### 3. **Visualization & Control**

Add-ons that help visualize Kubernetes clusters and offer user interfaces.

- **Dashboard**: Web-based interface for managing Kubernetes.

### 4. **Infrastructure**

These tools enhance the infrastructure layer and assist in managing resources beyond containers.

- **KubeVirt**: Enables the management of virtual machines on Kubernetes, mainly on bare-metal clusters.
- **Node Problem Detector**: Monitors Linux nodes for system issues and reports as Events or Node conditions.

### 5. **Instrumentation**

Instrumentation tools help monitor and gather metrics from Kubernetes resources.

- **kube-state-metrics**: Provides insights into the state of Kubernetes objects.

### 6. **Legacy Add-ons**

Older add-ons listed in Kubernetes’s deprecated cluster/addons directory. Active add-ons from this list should be linked here, and contributions to this section are welcome.
