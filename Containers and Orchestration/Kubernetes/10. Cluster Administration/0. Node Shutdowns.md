Node shutdowns in a Kubernetes cluster can be graceful (planned) or non-graceful (unexpected, such as due to a power outage). Each type of shutdown has specific handling requirements and configuration options to ensure continuity and prevent resource conflicts.

### 1. **Graceful Node Shutdown**

Graceful node shutdown ensures an orderly pod termination process when the node detects a system shutdown.

- **Feature State**: Kubernetes v1.21 [beta] (enabled by default).
- **System Dependency**: Requires `systemd` for detecting shutdowns via inhibitor locks.

#### **Configuration**:
1. **Enable Graceful Shutdown**: Both `shutdownGracePeriod` and `shutdownGracePeriodCriticalPods` must be set to non-zero values in the kubelet configuration.
2. **Node Shutdown Behavior**:
   - The kubelet sets the node's status to `NotReady`, preventing the scheduling of new pods.
   - All incoming pods are rejected, even if they have tolerations for `node.kubernetes.io/not-ready:NoSchedule`.

#### **Pod Termination Process**:
1. **Phased Shutdown**:
   - **Phase 1**: Regular pods are terminated.
   - **Phase 2**: Critical pods are terminated last.
2. **Example**:
   - `shutdownGracePeriod=30s`, `shutdownGracePeriodCriticalPods=10s`
   - Kubelet reserves the first 20 seconds for regular pods and the last 10 seconds for critical pods.

### 2. **Pod Priority-Based Graceful Node Shutdown**

Allows prioritizing pod termination order during shutdown based on pod priorities, offering finer control over the shutdown process.

- **Feature State**: Kubernetes v1.24 [beta] (enabled by default).
- **Configuration**:
  - Define `shutdownGracePeriodByPodPriority` in the kubelet config to specify shutdown durations per priority class.

#### **Example Configuration**:
- **Pod Priority Classes**:
  - `100000` (highest): 10 seconds
  - `10000`: 180 seconds
  - `1000`: 120 seconds
  - `0` (default): 60 seconds

### 3. **Non-Graceful Node Shutdown**

If a node shuts down unexpectedly, the kubelet may not detect this, leading to pods stuck in a terminating state and resources remaining attached.

- **Feature State**: Kubernetes v1.28 [stable] (enabled by default).

#### **Manual Intervention**:
1. **Taint the Node**: Apply the `node.kubernetes.io/out-of-service` taint with `NoExecute` or `NoSchedule`.
2. **Immediate Volume Detach**:
   - If the `NodeOutOfServiceVolumeDetach` feature gate is enabled, the kube-controller-manager force-deletes pods and detaches volumes immediately.

3. **Example Usage**:
   - Ensure the node is powered off before applying the taint.
   - After re-allocating the pods, remove the `out-of-service` taint if the node is recovered.

#### **Forced Storage Detach on Timeout**:
- Kubernetes automatically force-detaches volumes after 6 minutes if a node remains unhealthy, unless disabled by `disable-force-detach-on-timeout` in the kube-controller-manager.

### 4. **Node Shutdown Best Practices and Considerations**

- **Grace Periods**: Set appropriate shutdown grace periods based on pod priority to ensure critical workloads are gracefully terminated.
- **PodDisruptionBudget Compliance**: For graceful shutdowns, ensure pod disruptions are controlled by configuring PodDisruptionBudgets.
- **Avoid Data Corruption**: For workloads using volumes, use forced storage detach cautiously as it may violate the CSI specification if nodes are still using volumes.
