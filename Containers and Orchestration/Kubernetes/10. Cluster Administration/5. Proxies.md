In Kubernetes, proxies are used for load balancing, access control, and routing between different network endpoints. There are several types of proxies, each serving distinct roles within a Kubernetes cluster environment.

### 1. **kubectl Proxy**

- **Usage**: Typically run on a userâ€™s desktop or within a pod.
- **Purpose**: Connects a localhost address to the Kubernetes `apiserver`.
- **Connection**:
  - Client to Proxy: Uses HTTP.
  - Proxy to apiserver: Uses HTTPS.
- **Functionality**:
  - Locates the `apiserver`.
  - Adds necessary authentication headers for secure access.  

### 2. **apiserver Proxy**

- **Usage**: Acts as a bastion to connect external users to cluster IPs that may not be directly accessible.
- **Runs in**: `apiserver` processes.
- **Connection**:
  - Client to Proxy: Uses HTTPS (or HTTP if configured accordingly).
  - Proxy to Target: Uses HTTP or HTTPS as chosen by the proxy.
- **Capabilities**:
  - Provides access to Nodes, Pods, and Services within the cluster.
  - Performs load balancing when routing to a Service.

### 3. **kube-proxy**

- **Usage**: Deployed on each node in the cluster.
- **Purpose**: Routes network traffic and provides load balancing for services.
- **Supported Protocols**: UDP, TCP, and SCTP (does not handle HTTP specifically).
- **Limitations**: Only used for reaching Services within the cluster.

### 4. **Proxy/Load-balancer in Front of apiserver(s)**

- **Existence and Implementation**: Varies by cluster (commonly `nginx`).
- **Purpose**: Sits between clients and one or more `apiserver` instances.
- **Functionality**:
  - Acts as a load balancer when there are multiple `apiserver` instances.

### 5. **Cloud Load Balancers on External Services**

- **Availability**: Provided by some cloud providers (e.g., AWS ELB, Google Cloud Load Balancer).
- **Automatic Creation**: Generated automatically for Kubernetes services of type `LoadBalancer`.
- **Supported Protocols**: Typically UDP and TCP; SCTP support depends on the cloud provider.
- **Variability**: Implementation specifics vary by provider.

### **Typical User Focus**

Most Kubernetes users only need to interact with the `kubectl` and `apiserver` proxies. Cluster administrators are typically responsible for configuring additional proxies and load balancers for network traffic and external access.
