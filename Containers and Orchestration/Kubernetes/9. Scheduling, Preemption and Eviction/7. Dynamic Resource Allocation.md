Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) in Kubernetes enables the allocation and sharing of resources (e.g., GPUs) across Pods and containers. This system is a flexible generalization of the Persistent Volumes API, enabling the request and reservation of diverse resources within a cluster.

### 1. **Core Concepts and API**

DRA provides a framework for specifying resources through a flexible API:

- **ResourceClaim**: Requests access to resources and indicates allocation status.
- **ResourceClaimTemplate**: Defines templates for creating ResourceClaims for Pods.
- **DeviceClass**: Represents pre-defined device configurations and criteria for resource allocation.
- **PodSchedulingContext**: Used by the scheduler and drivers to coordinate resource allocation.
- **ResourceSlice**: Publishes resource availability, allowing the scheduler to manage resources with structured parameters.


### 2. **Resource Allocation Modes**

Kubernetes supports two main modes for handling DRA: **control plane controller** and **structured parameters**.

#### **Control Plane Controller Mode**

In this mode:
- The resource driver actively manages allocation by marking ResourceClaims as "allocated" and reserving resources on specific nodes.
- The scheduler checks ResourceClaims for each Pod and creates a `PodScheduling` object to identify compatible nodes.
- ResourceClaims get allocated only when suitable resources are available, avoiding scenarios where Pods are scheduled without access to necessary resources.

#### **Structured Parameters Mode**

In structured parameter mode:
- **Structured parameters** enable the scheduler to directly allocate resources using ResourceSlice data, which lists available resources and their attributes.
- Resource allocation decisions are made based on Custom Expression Language (CEL) criteria, helping the scheduler select resources without driver intervention.


### 3. **API Structure and Usage**

The **resource.k8s.io/v1alpha3 API group** introduces DRA-related types:

- **DeviceClass** specifies device types and configuration criteria.
- **ResourceClaimTemplate** allows defining resource request templates to facilitate consistent resource allocation across Pods.
  
**Example Pod with Dynamic Resources**:
This example allocates two resources to a Pod:

```yaml
apiVersion: resource.k8s.io/v1alpha3
kind: DeviceClass
name: resource.example.com
spec:
  selectors:
    - cel:
        expression: device.driver == "resource-driver.example.com"
---
apiVersion: resource.k8s.io/v1alpha2
kind: ResourceClaimTemplate
metadata:
  name: large-black-cat-claim-template
spec:
  spec:
    devices:
      requests:
        - name: req-0
          deviceClassName: resource.example.com
          selectors:
            - cel:
               expression: device.attributes["resource-driver.example.com"].color == "black" &&
                           device.attributes["resource-driver.example.com"].size == "large"
```


### 4. **Scheduling and Allocation**

#### **With Control Plane Controller**

- The scheduler coordinates with drivers via `PodSchedulingContext`, exchanging node suitability information for each ResourceClaim.
- Only nodes with sufficient resources are considered, minimizing unschedulable placements.

#### **With Structured Parameters**

- The scheduler allocates resources directly by referencing ResourceSlice objects, enabling fast, memory-efficient resource management.
- This approach allows rapid scheduling without frequent driver communication.


### 5. **Pre-scheduling and Node Selector Configuration**

For pre-scheduled Pods, avoid setting `.spec.nodeName` directly to ensure resource availability is confirmed prior to Pod binding. Use `nodeSelector` to ensure consistent scheduling.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pod-with-cats
spec:
  nodeSelector:
    kubernetes.io/hostname: name-of-the-intended-node
```


### 6. **Enabling and Configuring DRA**

- **Feature Gates**: The `DynamicResourceAllocation` and, if applicable, `DRAControlPlaneController` feature gates need to be enabled.
- **Resource Driver Installation**: Ensure that the required driver for specific resources (e.g., GPU) is installed.

To check for DRA support, query `DeviceClass` objects:

```bash
kubectl get deviceclasses
```

If unsupported, the cluster will return an error message indicating "deviceclasses" is unavailable.
