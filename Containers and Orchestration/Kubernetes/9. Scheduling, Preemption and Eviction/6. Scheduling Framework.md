The **Scheduling Framework** in Kubernetes is a modular, plugin-based system that allows extensible scheduling of Pods by introducing plugins into various stages of the scheduling process. This makes the Kubernetes scheduler highly customizable, lightweight, and easier to maintain.

### 1. **Framework Overview**

The Scheduling Framework enables the use of **plugins** to manage scheduling functionality while keeping the core scheduler minimal.

- **Plugins** register at specific **extension points** in the scheduling cycle, enabling customizable behavior at each stage.
- The scheduling process consists of **two main phases**: the **scheduling cycle** and the **binding cycle**.
  - **Scheduling Cycle**: Determines the best node for a Pod.
  - **Binding Cycle**: Commits the scheduling decision by binding the Pod to the node.


### 2. **Scheduling Workflow and Cycles**

- **Scheduling Cycle**: Finds the most appropriate node for a Pod. Runs serially.
- **Binding Cycle**: Applies the scheduling decision to the cluster. May run concurrently.

A cycle may **abort** if a Pod is unschedulable or if thereâ€™s an error, returning the Pod to the queue for retry.


### 3. **Key Interfaces and Extension Points**

Each extension point serves a specific purpose within the scheduling process, allowing plugins to act on or adjust scheduling behavior.

#### **Queue Management**

- **PreEnqueue**: Plugins called before adding a Pod to the active queue; failure places it in the unschedulable list.
- **EnqueueExtension**: Decides if rejected Pods should retry based on cluster changes.
- **QueueingHint**: Requeues a Pod based on specific cluster events to retry scheduling.

#### **Scheduling Decision**

- **QueueSort**: Sorts Pods in the scheduling queue. Only one plugin can define queue sorting.
- **PreFilter**: Validates Pod and cluster state, ensuring conditions are met for scheduling.
- **Filter**: Filters out nodes that cannot run the Pod based on plugin-defined constraints.

#### **Post-Filter Actions**

- **PostFilter**: Activates if no feasible nodes are found, potentially marking nodes schedulable.


### 4. **Scoring and Node Selection**

After filtering, scoring plugins rank nodes to determine the best fit.

- **PreScore**: Prepares state information for scoring nodes.
- **Score**: Assigns scores to nodes based on defined criteria, adjusting based on plugin weights.
- **NormalizeScore**: Adjusts scores to finalize node ranking.


### 5. **Reserve and Unreserve**

Reserve plugins are useful for managing stateful scheduling tasks.

- **Reserve**: Marks resources as reserved for the Pod before binding.
- **Unreserve**: Cleans up reserved resources if scheduling fails.


### 6. **Permit and PreBind**

- **Permit**: Controls whether binding should proceed, allowing plugins to approve, deny, or delay binding with a timeout.
- **PreBind**: Performs actions required before the Pod binds to the node, such as network provisioning.


### 7. **Final Binding and Post-Bind**

- **Bind**: Commits the Pod to a node. Bind plugins are called in sequence until one completes binding.
- **PostBind**: Provides informational updates after a Pod successfully binds.


### 8. **Plugin API and Customization**

The **Plugin API** enables plugin configuration and registration in the scheduler.

- Plugins implement various **interfaces** (e.g., `QueueSortPlugin`, `PreFilterPlugin`) that define specific actions within the scheduling cycle.
- **Configuration**: Scheduler plugins can be enabled or disabled, and Kubernetes allows creating custom plugins and defining them in **scheduler profiles** for different workloads.
