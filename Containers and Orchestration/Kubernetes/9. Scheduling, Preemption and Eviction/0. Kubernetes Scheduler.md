The Kubernetes **scheduler** is responsible for assigning newly created Pods to appropriate Nodes so they can be managed by the kubelet. The primary default scheduler is **kube-scheduler**, a core control plane component designed to manage Pod-to-Node assignments based on various criteria and resource constraints.

### 1. **kube-scheduler Functionality**

- **Scheduling Overview**:
  - When a new Pod is created, it initially has no Node assigned. The kube-scheduler monitors for these Pods and assigns each to an optimal Node.
  - This assignment involves filtering and scoring Nodes to meet each Pod’s requirements.
  - Alternatively, you can manually specify a Node for a Pod upon creation via the API, though this is uncommon.

- **kube-scheduler Customization**:
  - The kube-scheduler is configurable, and Kubernetes allows for custom scheduler implementations to replace kube-scheduler if needed.

### 2. **Node Selection Process in kube-scheduler**

The **scheduling process** involves two key steps: **Filtering** and **Scoring**.

- **Filtering**:
  - During filtering, kube-scheduler selects a set of feasible Nodes that meet a Pod’s specific resource requests and constraints.
  - Common filters include **PodFitsResources** to check available Node resources, among others.
  - If no Nodes meet the Pod's criteria, the Pod remains unscheduled until conditions allow it to be placed.

- **Scoring**:
  - After filtering, kube-scheduler scores the feasible Nodes based on specific scoring rules.
  - Nodes are ranked according to their scores, with the highest-scoring Node selected for Pod placement.
  - If multiple Nodes have equal scores, kube-scheduler selects one at random.

### 3. **Configuration Options for kube-scheduler**

Kubernetes provides two main ways to configure kube-scheduler’s filtering and scoring behaviors:

- **Scheduling Policies**:
  - **Predicates** for filtering define essential conditions a Node must satisfy to host a Pod.
  - **Priorities** for scoring determine the ranking criteria for feasible Nodes.

- **Scheduling Profiles**:
  - Scheduling Profiles offer more flexibility through **Plugins** that implement scheduling stages such as:
    - **QueueSort** (organizes Pods in the scheduling queue),
    - **Filter** (checks Pod feasibility),
    - **Score** (ranks Nodes),
    - **Bind** (finalizes Node assignment),
    - **Reserve** (holds resources),
    - **Permit** (approves Node selection).
  - Multiple profiles can be configured for kube-scheduler, allowing customized scheduling strategies across workloads.

### Key Scheduling Factors

- **Resource Requirements**: Individual and collective needs for CPU, memory, and storage.
- **Hardware & Software Constraints**: Node architecture, OS version, and software compatibility.
- **Affinity and Anti-Affinity Rules**: Preferences for Pods to be scheduled together or separately.
- **Data Locality**: Proximity to required data sources for improved efficiency.
- **Inter-Workload Interference**: Minimizing disruptions from competing workloads on the same Node.
