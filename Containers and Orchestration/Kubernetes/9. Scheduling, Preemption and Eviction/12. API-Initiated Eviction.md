API-initiated eviction enables graceful pod termination through the Kubernetes Eviction API, which respects policies such as PodDisruptionBudgets and `terminationGracePeriodSeconds`. This contrasts with node-pressure eviction, which bypasses these configurations.

### 1. **Triggering an API-Initiated Eviction**

You can initiate an eviction by creating an Eviction object for a specific pod using the Kubernetes API directly or through a client (e.g., `kubectl drain`). This action is similar to a controlled `DELETE` operation on the pod.

#### **Example Eviction Object**:
```json
{
  "apiVersion": "policy/v1",
  "kind": "Eviction",
  "metadata": {
    "name": "pod-name",
    "namespace": "default"
  }
}
```

#### **Eviction Using `curl`**:
```bash
curl -v -H 'Content-type: application/json' \
https://your-cluster-api-endpoint.example/api/v1/namespaces/default/pods/pod-name/eviction -d @eviction.json
```


### 2. **API Server Response to Eviction Requests**

When an eviction is requested, the API server performs checks and responds as follows:

- **200 OK**: Eviction is allowed; the pod is terminated after being marked for deletion.
- **429 Too Many Requests**: Eviction is not allowed due to PodDisruptionBudget or API rate limits.
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Eviction fails due to configuration errors, such as overlapping PodDisruptionBudgets.

If the pod does not belong to a workload with a PodDisruptionBudget, eviction automatically succeeds with a `200 OK` response.


### 3. **Eviction Workflow**

Upon successful eviction initiation:

1. **Deletion Timestamp**: The pod receives a deletion timestamp, marking it as terminated.
2. **Graceful Shutdown**: The kubelet on the node where the pod runs detects this and starts the graceful shutdown process.
3. **Endpoint Removal**: The control plane removes the pod from relevant Endpoint and EndpointSlice objects.
4. **Forceful Termination**: After the configured grace period expires, the kubelet forcefully stops the pod.
5. **Pod Removal**: The API server removes the pod resource from the cluster.


### 4. **Handling Stuck Evictions**

Evictions may get "stuck" if, for example, a ReplicaSet continuously creates pods that fail to reach a `Ready` state, or if the last evicted pod had a lengthy termination period.

#### **Troubleshooting Stuck Evictions**:

1. **Pause Automated Processes**: Stop any automated processes that may be triggering these evictions. Diagnose and fix the root cause before resuming.
2. **Direct Deletion**: Manually delete the pod from the control plane, bypassing the Eviction API.

API-initiated evictions are an effective way to handle controlled pod terminations, maintaining cluster policies while ensuring smooth workload management through graceful shutdowns and policy enforcement.
