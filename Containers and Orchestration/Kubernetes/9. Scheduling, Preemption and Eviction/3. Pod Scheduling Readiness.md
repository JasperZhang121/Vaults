**Pod Scheduling Readiness** in Kubernetes allows control over when a Pod is ready to be scheduled, preventing unnecessary scheduling attempts for Pods that may lack essential resources.

### 1. **Purpose of Pod Scheduling Readiness**

Previously, all Pods were immediately considered schedulable upon creation. However, <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">some Pods might lack critical resources or dependencies, leading to repeated and unnecessary scheduler attempts</mark>. The **schedulingGates** field addresses this by holding Pods from scheduling until they are truly ready, thus reducing scheduler workload and enhancing system efficiency.


### 2. **Configuring `schedulingGates`**

The `schedulingGates` field is a list of criteria (as strings) that must be satisfied before a Pod can be scheduled. Each gate can only be removed after Pod creation but cannot be added afterward.

#### Example Pod with Scheduling Gates

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: test-pod
spec:
  schedulingGates:
    - name: example.com/foo
    - name: example.com/bar
  containers:
    - name: pause
      image: registry.k8s.io/pause:3.6
```

After creation, this Pod will stay in the **SchedulingGated** state until the gates are cleared.


### 3. **Monitoring and Managing Scheduling Gates**

- **Check State**:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pod test-pod
  ```
  - The Pod will show `SchedulingGated` under STATUS if gates are active.

- **Clear Gates**:
  To make the Pod ready for scheduling, apply an updated manifest without the `schedulingGates` field:
  
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Pod
  metadata:
    name: test-pod
  spec:
    containers:
      - name: pause
        image: registry.k8s.io/pause:3.6
  ```
  - The Pod state will transition to **Running** if resources are available.


### 4. **Observability**

The **scheduler_pending_pods** metric now includes a `gated` label, allowing you to monitor Pods explicitly marked as unschedulable due to scheduling gates. Example usage:
```plaintext
scheduler_pending_pods{queue="gated"}
```


### 5. **Mutable Scheduling Directives for Gated Pods**

Pods with active scheduling gates can still have some scheduling directives modified. This is limited to “tightening” constraints, meaning updates that restrict the Pod to fewer nodes. Rules include:

- **NodeSelector**: Only additions are allowed.
- **Node Affinity**: New constraints are permitted, while existing match expressions remain unchanged.
- **Preferred Scheduling Terms**: All modifications are allowed.
