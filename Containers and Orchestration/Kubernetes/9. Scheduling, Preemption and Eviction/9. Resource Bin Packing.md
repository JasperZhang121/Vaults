The **NodeResourcesFit** plugin in kube-scheduler supports two strategies for resource bin packing: **MostAllocated** and **RequestedToCapacityRatio**. These strategies aim to optimize resource utilization across cluster nodes by prioritizing nodes with specific resource allocation characteristics.

### 1. **MostAllocated Strategy**

The **MostAllocated** strategy scores nodes based on resource utilization, prioritizing nodes with higher resource allocation.

**Example Configuration**:
```yaml
apiVersion: kubescheduler.config.k8s.io/v1
kind: KubeSchedulerConfiguration
profiles:
- pluginConfig:
  - name: NodeResourcesFit
    args:
      scoringStrategy:
        type: MostAllocated
        resources:
        - name: cpu
          weight: 1
        - name: memory
          weight: 1
        - name: intel.com/foo
          weight: 3
        - name: intel.com/bar
          weight: 3
```
- **resources**: Specifies resource types and weights. Higher weights give more influence to a resource type in node scoring.
- Use this strategy to ensure higher allocation of resources, favoring nodes that are already partially utilized.


### 2. **RequestedToCapacityRatio Strategy**

The **RequestedToCapacityRatio** strategy scores nodes by comparing the ratio of requested to available resources. It enables bin packing for extended resources by scoring based on a customizable function.

**Example Configuration**:
```yaml
apiVersion: kubescheduler.config.k8s.io/v1
kind: KubeSchedulerConfiguration
profiles:
- pluginConfig:
  - name: NodeResourcesFit
    args:
      scoringStrategy:
        type: RequestedToCapacityRatio
        resources:
        - name: intel.com/foo
          weight: 3
        - name: intel.com/bar
          weight: 3
        requestedToCapacityRatio:
          shape:
          - utilization: 0
            score: 0
          - utilization: 100
            score: 10
```
- **requestedToCapacityRatio.shape**: Defines the scoring curve, which can be tailored to prioritize either high or low resource utilization.
  - A higher score at high utilization promotes bin packing, while a lower score at high utilization promotes spreading.


### 3. **Tuning the Scoring Function**

The **shape** parameter allows tuning the **RequestedToCapacityRatio** function to achieve the desired resource allocation pattern:

- **High Utilization Preference (Bin Packing)**:
  ```yaml
  shape:
    - utilization: 0
      score: 0
    - utilization: 100
      score: 10
  ```
- **Low Utilization Preference (Spreading)**:
  ```yaml
  shape:
    - utilization: 0
      score: 10
    - utilization: 100
      score: 0
  ```

**Resource Weights**:
- Default weights are `cpu: 1` and `memory: 1`.
- Weights can be adjusted to influence specific resources more heavily, as shown below:
  ```yaml
  resources:
    - name: intel.com/foo
      weight: 5
    - name: cpu
      weight: 3
    - name: memory
      weight: 1
  ```


### 4. **Calculating Node Scores (Example)**

Consider two nodes with specified resources and weights:
- **Node 1** (Available resources: `intel.com/foo: 4`, `memory: 1GB`, `cpu: 8`), with used resources as shown:
  - Score Calculation:
    - **intel.com/foo**: 75% utilized (score 7)
    - **memory**: 50% utilized (score 5)
    - **cpu**: 37.5% utilized (score 3)
    - **Total Score**: `((7 * 5) + (5 * 1) + (3 * 3)) / (5 + 1 + 3) = 5`

- **Node 2** (Available resources: `intel.com/foo: 8`, `memory: 1GB`, `cpu: 8`), with used resources as shown:
  - Score Calculation:
    - **intel.com/foo**: 50% utilized (score 5)
    - **memory**: 75% utilized (score 7)
    - **cpu**: 100% utilized (score 10)
    - **Total Score**: `((5 * 5) + (7 * 1) + (10 * 3)) / (5 + 1 + 3) = 7`

These calculations illustrate how nodes are scored based on resource allocation to prioritize nodes closer to capacity while balancing multiple resources.
