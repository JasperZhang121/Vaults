**Taints and Tolerations** in Kubernetes ensure that Pods are only scheduled onto suitable nodes. Taints <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">prevent Pods from running on specific nodes unless they have tolerations</mark> that match those taints.

### 1. **Concept Overview**

- **Node Affinity**: Attracts Pods to certain nodes.
- **Taints**: Applied to nodes to repel Pods unless they tolerate the taint.
- **Tolerations**: Applied to Pods, allowing them to schedule onto nodes with specific taints.


### 2. **Applying Taints to Nodes**

Use `kubectl taint` to add taints to nodes.

```bash
kubectl taint nodes node1 key1=value1:NoSchedule
```

- **Effect Types**:
  - **NoSchedule**: Prevents new Pods from being scheduled unless they have a matching toleration.
  - **PreferNoSchedule**: Avoids scheduling but does not strictly prevent it.
  - **NoExecute**: Evicts running Pods that do not tolerate the taint.

To remove a taint:

```bash
kubectl taint nodes node1 key1=value1:NoSchedule-
```


### 3. **Setting Tolerations on Pods**

Specify tolerations in the Pod’s spec to match taints.

```yaml
tolerations:
- key: "key1"
  operator: "Equal"
  value: "value1"
  effect: "NoSchedule"
```

- **Operator Types**:
  - **Exists**: Matches any taint with the specified key.
  - **Equal**: Matches taints with the exact key-value pair.
- **Toleration Examples**:
  - **Match all taints with effect `NoExecute` and a key of `key1`**:

    ```yaml
    tolerations:
    - key: "key1"
      operator: "Exists"
      effect: "NoExecute"
    ```

  - **Tolerate a `NoExecute` taint for 3600 seconds**:

    ```yaml
    tolerations:
    - key: "key1"
      operator: "Equal"
      value: "value1"
      effect: "NoExecute"
      tolerationSeconds: 3600
    ```


### 4. **Effect Types and Interactions**

- **NoSchedule**: Kubernetes will not schedule Pods that lack the appropriate toleration.
- **PreferNoSchedule**: The scheduler tries to avoid placing the Pod on the node but will if necessary.
- **NoExecute**: Evicts already running Pods that don’t have a toleration and prevents new Pods from scheduling.

**Processing Multiple Taints and Tolerations**:
- If a Pod lacks tolerations for a **NoSchedule** taint, it won’t be scheduled.
- If a node has a **PreferNoSchedule** taint, Kubernetes will avoid scheduling the Pod there if possible.
- If a **NoExecute** taint is added, Pods that do not tolerate it are evicted.


### 5. **Example Use Cases**

#### Dedicated Nodes
To dedicate nodes to specific users or workloads:
1. **Apply a taint**:

   ```bash
   kubectl taint nodes nodename dedicated=groupName:NoSchedule
   ```

2. **Add a toleration** to specific Pods for access:

   ```yaml
   tolerations:
   - key: "dedicated"
     operator: "Equal"
     value: "groupName"
     effect: "NoSchedule"
   ```

#### Nodes with Special Hardware
To restrict access to nodes with GPUs or other special hardware:
1. **Taint GPU nodes**:

   ```bash
   kubectl taint nodes nodename special=true:NoSchedule
   ```

2. **Add tolerations** to GPU-enabled Pods.


### 6. **Taint-based Evictions**

The **Node Controller** automatically applies taints based on node conditions.

- **Built-in Node Taints**:
  - `node.kubernetes.io/not-ready`: Node is not ready.
  - `node.kubernetes.io/unreachable`: Node is unreachable.
  - **Resource Pressure Taints**:
    - `node.kubernetes.io/memory-pressure`
    - `node.kubernetes.io/disk-pressure`
    - `node.kubernetes.io/pid-pressure`

If a node becomes unreachable, taints like `NoExecute` can evict or keep Pods based on toleration configurations.


### 7. **Toleration Seconds for Extended Binding**

Specify `tolerationSeconds` to define how long a Pod remains bound to a failing or unresponsive node before eviction:

```yaml
tolerations:
- key: "node.kubernetes.io/unreachable"
  operator: "Exists"
  effect: "NoExecute"
  tolerationSeconds: 6000
```


### 8. **Automatic Tolerations and DaemonSets**

- **Default Tolerations**: Kubernetes adds a `tolerationSeconds=300` for `node.kubernetes.io/not-ready` and `node.kubernetes.io/unreachable`, keeping Pods bound for 5 minutes.
- **DaemonSets**: Automatically include NoExecute tolerations for `node.kubernetes.io/unreachable` and `node.kubernetes.io/not-ready` to prevent eviction due to these conditions.


### 9. **Automatic Taints by Condition**

The **Node Controller** auto-taints nodes based on conditions instead of node conditions directly affecting scheduling. Nodes under **Memory Pressure** or **Disk Pressure** are tainted accordingly to block additional scheduling without impacting existing Pods.
