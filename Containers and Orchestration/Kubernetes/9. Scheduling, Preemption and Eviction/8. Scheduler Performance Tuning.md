The **kube-scheduler** is the primary component responsible for assigning Pods to Nodes in a Kubernetes cluster. In large clusters, configuring the scheduler to optimize performance can improve scheduling speed and accuracy. 

### 1. **Tuning the Scheduling Threshold (`percentageOfNodesToScore`)**

The **percentageOfNodesToScore** parameter determines the percentage of Nodes to evaluate for Pod placement, allowing faster scheduling by reducing the number of nodes examined for feasibility.

- **Range**: 0-100 (with 0 using the default, calculated threshold).
- **Default**: Automatically set based on cluster size, typically 50% for 100 Nodes and decreasing to a minimum of 5% for very large clusters.

**Example Configuration**:
```yaml
apiVersion: kubescheduler.config.k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: KubeSchedulerConfiguration
percentageOfNodesToScore: 50
```

### 2. **Setting the Threshold for Node Scoring**

The scheduler stops evaluating nodes for feasibility once the configured percentage is met, improving scheduling speed in larger clusters.

- **Default Behavior**: Uses a linear formula to determine the threshold dynamically.
- **Custom Threshold**: Setting **percentageOfNodesToScore** to a high value (like 100) evaluates all nodes, ensuring the most accurate scheduling, but at the cost of latency.

#### **Guidelines**:
- Avoid very low thresholds (below 10%) unless Pod placement accuracy is less critical than throughput.
- For small clusters (<100 Nodes), the scheduler automatically checks all nodes.

### 3. **Node Scoring and Iteration Order**

The kube-scheduler iterates over Nodes in a round-robin manner, ensuring fair consideration across all Nodes and zones:

1. Nodes are treated as an array, with the scheduler beginning at the start and continuing until the threshold is met.
2. Iteration resumes from where it left off in the array for each subsequent Pod.
3. **Multi-Zone Clusters**: The scheduler cycles across zones to ensure balanced consideration of Nodes across different zones, optimizing for geographic or zone-based load balancing.

**Example Iteration Order**:
For a cluster with Nodes spread across two zones:
   - Zone 1: Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4
   - Zone 2: Node 5, Node 6

   The scheduler iterates as follows: **Node 1, Node 5, Node 2, Node 6, Node 3, Node 4**.

### 4. **Balancing Scheduler Performance and Placement Quality**

- **Low Thresholds**: Speed up scheduling at the cost of reduced placement quality.
- **High Thresholds**: Ensure optimal placement but may slow scheduling.
- **Cluster Size Considerations**: For large clusters, adjusting **percentageOfNodesToScore** can meaningfully improve scheduler performance without significantly impacting placement quality.
