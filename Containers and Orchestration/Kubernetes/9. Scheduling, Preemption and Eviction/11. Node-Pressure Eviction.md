Node-pressure eviction is a mechanism in Kubernetes by which the kubelet proactively terminates pods to reclaim resources on a node under resource pressure, ensuring continued node stability.

### 1. **What Triggers Node-Pressure Eviction**

- The kubelet monitors node resources like memory, disk space, and inodes.
- When certain resource usage exceeds configured thresholds, kubelet terminates lower-priority pods to free up resources.
- Node-pressure eviction bypasses API-initiated eviction and does not respect PodDisruptionBudget or `terminationGracePeriodSeconds`.

**Self-Healing**: The kubelet automatically removes unused images and failed pods before evicting user-defined pods to reclaim resources.

### 2. **Eviction Signals and Thresholds**

#### **Eviction Signals**:
Kubelet monitors several metrics, including:

- **Memory Available** (`memory.available`)
- **Disk Space Available** (`nodefs.available`, `imagefs.available`, `containerfs.available`)
- **Inodes Available** (`nodefs.inodesFree`, `imagefs.inodesFree`, `containerfs.inodesFree`)
- **Process IDs (PIDs) Available** (`pid.available`)

#### **Eviction Thresholds**:
Eviction thresholds are configured limits that dictate when eviction occurs. Thresholds are defined as either:

- **Soft Eviction Thresholds**: Triggers evictions after a grace period.
- **Hard Eviction Thresholds**: Immediately evict pods when the threshold is exceeded.

#### **Example Configuration for Hard Thresholds**:
```yaml
apiVersion: kubelet.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: KubeletConfiguration
evictionHard:
  memory.available: "500Mi"
  nodefs.available: "10%"
  imagefs.available: "15%"
```

### 3. **Filesystem Signal Types**

Kubelet identifies and uses the following filesystems:

- **nodefs**: Primary filesystem, covering `/var/lib/kubelet`, local disk volumes, etc.
- **imagefs**: Optional filesystem, for storing container images.
- **containerfs**: Optional filesystem, for container writable layers and non-image data.

### 4. **Eviction Monitoring and Node Conditions**

- **Monitoring Intervals**: Kubelet checks resource use every 10 seconds by default, adjusting node conditions accordingly.
- **Node Conditions**: Conditions like `MemoryPressure`, `DiskPressure`, and `PIDPressure` are set when respective eviction signals are met.

To reduce oscillation in node conditions, use the `eviction-pressure-transition-period` flag to stabilize transitions.

### 5. **Eviction Order for Pods**

The kubelet prioritizes evictions based on:

1. **Resource Usage Exceeding Requests**: BestEffort and Burstable pods exceeding their requests are evicted first.
2. **Pod Priority**: Eviction order respects pod priority, with higher-priority pods evicted last.
3. **Resource Usage Relative to Requests**: Pods using more resources than requested are prioritized for eviction.

#### **Eviction Order for Filesystem Evictions**:

- **Without imagefs**: Kubelet considers total disk usage (including local volumes, logs, writable container layers).
- **With imagefs**: Separates container writable layers from image storage, refining eviction order based on usage per filesystem.

### 6. **Configuring Reclaim Limits**

The `--eviction-minimum-reclaim` flag ensures kubelet reclaims a minimum amount of resources before stopping eviction, reducing repetitive evictions.

#### **Example Minimum Reclaim Configuration**:
```yaml
evictionMinimumReclaim:
  memory.available: "0Mi"
  nodefs.available: "500Mi"
  imagefs.available: "2Gi"
```

### 7. **Out-of-Memory (OOM) Handling**

If kubelet fails to preemptively reclaim resources, the `oom_killer` selects a process for termination based on:

- **Quality of Service (QoS)**: Evicts BestEffort first, then Burstable, and finally Guaranteed pods.
- **oom_score_adj**: Assigned based on pod QoS and resource usage, influencing which containers get terminated first.

### 8. **Best Practices for Eviction Policies**

- **Set realistic eviction thresholds**: For nodes with high memory or CPU demands, configure kubelet memory and disk thresholds to ensure smooth eviction handling.
- **DaemonSets and Pod Priority**: To avoid DaemonSet pod eviction, assign higher priority by setting `priorityClassName`.
- **Consider Reserved Resources**: Use `--kube-reserved` and `--system-reserved` flags to reserve adequate resources for system functions, reducing eviction pressure.

### 9. **Known Issues with Node-Pressure Eviction**

- **Delayed Memory Pressure Detection**: Use the `--kernel-memcg-notification` flag for faster memory usage updates to kubelet.
- **Intensive I/O Workloads**: For containers with high I/O, setting memory limits can prevent kubelet from detecting memory as available due to kernel caching behavior (tracked as `active_file` memory).
