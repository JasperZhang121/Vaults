In Kubernetes, **Pod Overhead** accounts for the extra system resources a Pod requires beyond its container resource requests and limits. Pod overhead enables Kubernetes to ensure resource quotas, node scheduling, and Pod cgroup sizing include these additional resources, enhancing the accuracy of resource allocation.

### 1. **Understanding Pod Overhead**

- **Definition**: Pod overhead is the extra CPU and memory required by the Pod infrastructure on top of container requests and limits.
- **Admission Time**: The Pod’s overhead is set based on its **RuntimeClass** at admission, adding extra resource requirements that are considered during scheduling, quota calculation, and Pod cgroup sizing.

### 2. **Configuring Pod Overhead**

To configure Pod overhead, define a **RuntimeClass** specifying the `overhead` field. Here’s an example for a RuntimeClass that allocates additional CPU and memory overhead:

```yaml
apiVersion: node.k8s.io/v1
kind: RuntimeClass
metadata:
  name: kata-fc
handler: kata-fc
overhead:
  podFixed:
    memory: "120Mi"
    cpu: "250m"
```

When a Pod specifies `kata-fc` as its `runtimeClassName`, this overhead is applied, affecting resource quotas, node scheduling, and Pod cgroup sizing.

#### Usage Example

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: test-pod
spec:
  runtimeClassName: kata-fc
  containers:
  - name: busybox-ctr
    image: busybox:1.28
    resources:
      limits:
        cpu: 500m
        memory: 100Mi
  - name: nginx-ctr
    image: nginx
    resources:
      limits:
        cpu: 1500m
        memory: 100Mi
```

In this case, the total resource requirements for scheduling include the sum of the container limits plus the Pod overhead (250m CPU, 120Mi memory). The scheduler seeks a Node with 2.25 CPU and 320 MiB of memory available for the Pod.

### 3. **Quota and Scheduling with Pod Overhead**

- **ResourceQuota**: Both container requests and Pod overhead contribute to quota calculations. Kubernetes enforces this at admission time.
- **Node Selection**: The kube-scheduler considers the Pod’s overhead in addition to container requests to find Nodes with sufficient resources.

### 4. **Cgroup Sizing and Limits**

Once a Pod is scheduled, kubelet configures the Pod’s **cgroup** with limits based on container limits plus Pod overhead. For Guaranteed and Burstable Pods, kubelet uses:
- **cpu.cfs_quota_us** for CPU.
- **memory.limit_in_bytes** for memory, ensuring cgroups have defined upper bounds.

### Observing Pod Overhead

Metrics like **kube_pod_overhead_*** from **kube-state-metrics** provide insights into Pod overhead usage, helping monitor workload stability and resource utilization efficiency.
