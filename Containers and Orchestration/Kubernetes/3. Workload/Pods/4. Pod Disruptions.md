Disruptions in Kubernetes refer to any interruption or termination of Pods, impacting the availability of applications. Disruptions can be **voluntary** (planned or controlled) or **involuntary** (unplanned events due to hardware or software failures). Understanding these types helps application owners build highly available applications and allows cluster administrators to manage cluster operations like upgrades with minimal impact.

#### Types of Disruptions

1. **Involuntary Disruptions**:
   - Occur due to hardware or system failures, often unavoidable.
   - Examples: hardware failure, kernel panic, cloud provider failure, out-of-resource eviction, and network partition.

2. **Voluntary Disruptions**:
   - Initiated by the application owner, cluster administrator, or automated processes.
   - Examples include scaling down nodes, node draining for updates, pod deletion by accident, or cluster autoscaling.

#### Dealing with Disruptions

1. **Mitigating Involuntary Disruptions**:
   - Ensure adequate resource requests for Pods.
   - Increase application resilience with replication across nodes or zones.
   - Implement anti-affinity or multi-zone clustering for high availability.

2. **Managing Voluntary Disruptions**:
   - Regularly consult with cluster administrators to understand any automated disruptions.
   - **Pod Disruption Budgets (PDBs)** are key to managing voluntary disruptions and ensuring a minimum number of running Pods during updates.

#### Pod Disruption Budgets (PDBs)

**PDBs** provide a way to <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">limit voluntary disruptions by setting thresholds for minimum available Pods, preventing too many disruptions simultaneously</mark>. For example, a web app might need at least 2 out of 3 Pods available to serve traffic during updates.

- **Using PDBs with Eviction API**:
  - PDBs work with the Eviction API to prevent exceeding set limits for disruption.
  - Tools like `kubectl drain` use the Eviction API to evict Pods while respecting PDBs.

- **Example PDB Scenario**:
  - A 3-node cluster running a 3-Pod deployment with a PDB set to allow only 1 Pod disruption.
  - Draining one node causes the eviction of one Pod while maintaining two Pods to meet the PDB requirements.

#### Pod Disruption Conditions

As of Kubernetes v1.31, the **Pod DisruptionTarget condition** flags Pods due for termination. This field includes reasons like:
- **PreemptionByScheduler** for high-priority Pod accommodation.
- **EvictionByEvictionAPI** when using Kubernetes' eviction API.
- **TerminationByKubelet** due to resource pressure or critical system needs.

These conditions provide insight into the cause of Pod disruptions, enabling administrators to respond to and manage Pod behavior effectively.

#### Disruptive Actions for Cluster Administrators

When planning disruptions for tasks like node upgrades:
- **Options**:
  1. **Accept Downtime**: Suitable for low-priority upgrades.
  2. **Failover to Replica Cluster**: High availability with higher resource costs.
  3. **Disruption Tolerance and PDBs**: No downtime and minimal duplication. Writing disruption-tolerant applications can help support autoscaling and improve resilience to both voluntary and involuntary disruptions.

By setting clear PDBs and managing disruption conditions, cluster administrators can maintain high application availability even during necessary maintenance activities.
