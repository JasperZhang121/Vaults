In Kubernetes, Quality of Service (QoS) classes are classifications assigned to Pods to manage resource allocation and eviction priority under resource pressure. These QoS classes—**Guaranteed**, **Burstable**, and **BestEffort**—help Kubernetes prioritize Pods for eviction based on their resource usage and guarantees.

### QoS Classes Overview

1. **Guaranteed**:
   - Pods with strict resource limits, least likely to face eviction.
   - Criteria:
     - Every container must have a **memory limit** and a **memory request**.
     - **Memory limit** must equal the **memory request**.
     - Every container must have a **CPU limit** and a **CPU request**.
     - **CPU limit** must equal the **CPU request**.

2. **Burstable**:
   - Pods with some guaranteed resources but can consume more if available.
   - Criteria:
     - At least one container in the Pod has a **memory or CPU request or limit**.
     - Pod does not meet the criteria for Guaranteed.

3. **BestEffort**:
   - Pods that use unassigned resources on a Node; highest eviction priority.
   - Criteria:
     - None of the containers in the Pod have a **memory or CPU request or limit**.

### Memory QoS with cgroup v2

**Memory QoS** provides additional resource control in Kubernetes by leveraging the memory controller of **cgroup v2** to manage memory requests and limits more precisely:
   - **memory.min**: Ensures memory availability by setting minimum memory usage.
   - **memory.high**: Throttles memory usage when it approaches its set limit.

This feature enhances resource control without directly relying on QoS class alone but still benefits from these classifications.

### Eviction Priority

When a Node is under resource pressure, Kubernetes evicts Pods in the following order:
1. **BestEffort** Pods
2. **Burstable** Pods
3. **Guaranteed** Pods

**Note**: Kubernetes only considers Pods that exceed their resource requests as candidates for eviction.

### Resource Behavior Independent of QoS

- **Exceeding Resource Limits**: Any container exceeding its resource limit will be killed and restarted.
- **Eviction under Resource Pressure**: If a container exceeds its resource request, it may be evicted when the node experiences resource pressure.
- **Pod-Level Requests and Limits**: Kubernetes sums up the requests and limits of all containers within a Pod to calculate the Pod’s total resource requirements.

QoS classes allow Kubernetes to manage resources effectively, ensuring that higher-priority Pods remain stable and available during times of resource scarcity.
