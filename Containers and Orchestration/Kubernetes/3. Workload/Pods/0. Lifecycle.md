Kubernetes defines a structured lifecycle for Pods, classifying them as ephemeral entities created, assigned a unique ID (UID), and managed until termination, or deletion.

#### Pod Lifecycle Phases

1. **Pending**: The Pod is accepted by the cluster, but its containers aren’t ready to run.
2. **Running**: The Pod is bound to a node, and its containers are starting or already running.
3. **Succeeded**: All containers in the Pod have completed successfully.
4. **Failed**: At least one container in the Pod failed (e.g., non-zero exit status).
5. **Unknown**: The Pod’s state cannot be determined, often due to communication issues.

#### Example Pod Status in `kubectl`:

```plaintext
NAMESPACE      NAME             READY   STATUS             RESTARTS   AGE
my-namespace   example-pod      0/1     CrashLoopBackOff   10         5m
```

In cases where a Pod is crashing repeatedly, `CrashLoopBackOff` appears in the `STATUS` field, showing exponential backoff delays for each restart attempt.

#### Pod Termination Flow

1. **Graceful Shutdown**: Kubernetes signals the container with `TERM`, waiting up to `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` (default is 30 seconds) for completion.
2. **SIGKILL**: If the grace period expires, Kubernetes forcefully stops the Pod.
3. **Cleanup**: Once terminated, the Pod transitions to a terminal phase (`Failed` or `Succeeded`) and is removed from the API server.

#### Container States

Kubernetes tracks each container’s state within a Pod, including:

- **Waiting**: The container is preparing to run, downloading images or configuring secrets.
- **Running**: The container is executing without issues.
- **Terminated**: The container has finished its process or encountered a failure.

Use `kubectl describe pod <pod-name>` to check the state of each container.

#### Handling Pod Issues

When a container fails, Kubernetes applies the `restartPolicy` (default: `Always`) to determine if the container should restart. For instance:

- **CrashLoopBackOff**: Indicates an issue with continuous restarting. This state employs an exponential backoff to prevent the system from overloading.
- **Debugging**: Inspect logs (`kubectl logs <pod-name>`), events, and configuration settings to troubleshoot repeated failures.

#### Probes

1. **livenessProbe**: Checks if the container is alive; if it fails, Kubernetes restarts the container.
2. **readinessProbe**: Determines if the container can receive traffic; failing Pods are removed from service endpoints.
3. **startupProbe**: Allows for extended startup time before failing liveness checks.

#### Pod Readiness Gates

Pods can specify custom readiness conditions using `readinessGates` in the Pod spec, allowing external feedback for Pod readiness.

```yaml
kind: Pod
spec:
  readinessGates:
    - conditionType: "example.com/custom-readiness"
```

#### Garbage Collection

Kubernetes uses the Pod Garbage Collector to clean up terminated Pods (either `Succeeded` or `Failed`) when Pod counts exceed a threshold.

- **Orphan Pods**: Pods bound to non-existent nodes are cleaned up.
- **Terminating Pods on Out-of-Service Nodes**: Pods bound to a non-ready node tainted as `out-of-service` are also removed.

#### Forced Termination

To force a Pod deletion immediately, use:
```bash
kubectl delete pod <pod-name> --grace-period=0 --force
```
