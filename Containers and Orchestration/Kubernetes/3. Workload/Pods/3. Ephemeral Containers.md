Ephemeral containers are temporary, user-initiated containers in a Pod that facilitate actions like troubleshooting. Unlike standard containers, ephemeral containers are not meant for application development or to serve a workload but rather offer tools for inspecting and diagnosing a Pod’s state without disrupting its primary function.

### Key Characteristics

1. **Temporary and Non-Restartable**: Ephemeral containers are intended for short-term use and will not automatically restart.
2. **Limited Configuration Options**: They share some configuration options with standard containers but have specific restrictions, such as no resource allocation or port definitions.
3. **Purpose-Built for Troubleshooting**: Ephemeral containers are ideal when other debugging methods, such as `kubectl exec`, are insufficient.

### Use Cases for Ephemeral Containers

Ephemeral containers are particularly beneficial in situations like:
- **Troubleshooting crashed containers** where `kubectl exec` cannot be used.
- **Inspecting distroless images** that lack built-in debugging tools.
- **Viewing processes across containers** (when process namespace sharing is enabled).

### How Ephemeral Containers Work

Ephemeral containers are created using a dedicated handler in the Kubernetes API (`ephemeralcontainers`) rather than directly editing `pod.spec`. Once added, you cannot change or remove an ephemeral container, ensuring the Pod’s resource allocations and configurations remain consistent.

### Restrictions for Ephemeral Containers

Since ephemeral containers have a unique function within Kubernetes, they have limitations:
- **No Port Exposure**: Ephemeral containers cannot expose ports; therefore, fields like `ports`, `livenessProbe`, and `readinessProbe` are disallowed.
- **No Resource Allocation**: Unlike regular containers, ephemeral containers cannot request or limit resources.
- **Non-Support for Static Pods**: Static Pods do not support ephemeral containers, as static Pods are created and managed by the kubelet, limiting flexibility for dynamic container additions.

### Example Use Case

Suppose you have a Pod running a distroless container (which lacks a shell or debugging tools). If one of its containers crashes or experiences issues, adding an ephemeral container with the necessary diagnostic utilities enables in-depth inspection. This approach avoids rebuilding or redeploying the entire Pod while allowing access to logs, configuration files, and processes.

### Enabling Process Namespace Sharing

Process namespace sharing allows you to view and manage processes across all containers within a Pod. This feature is useful for ephemeral containers since it provides visibility into other containers’ processes within the same Pod, making troubleshooting more efficient and comprehensive.

Ephemeral containers provide a low-impact, flexible way to troubleshoot and inspect Pod behavior in Kubernetes without requiring disruptive modifications or redeployments.
