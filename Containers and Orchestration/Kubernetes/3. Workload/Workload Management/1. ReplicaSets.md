A **ReplicaSet** ensures that a specified number of replica Pods are consistently running, guaranteeing the availability of identical Pods across nodes. Typically, Deployments are preferred as they manage ReplicaSets automatically, providing additional features such as rolling updates.

### Purpose and Functionality of ReplicaSets

- **Primary Role**: Maintain a stable set of replicas for availability.
- **Operations**: Creates and deletes Pods to match the desired replica count.
- **Ownership**: Links to Pods via the `metadata.ownerReferences` field, indicating the owning ReplicaSet.
- **Pod Acquisition**: Can acquire Pods with matching selectors but without controllers, ensuring they do not exceed the specified count.

### When to Use a ReplicaSet

While ReplicaSets can be used independently, **Deployments** are recommended for most scenarios as they provide better orchestration, updates, and management for Pods and ReplicaSets. Use a ReplicaSet directly if:
1. You need custom update orchestration.
2. The application does not require updates.

### ReplicaSet YAML Example

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: frontend
  labels:
    app: guestbook
    tier: frontend
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      tier: frontend
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        tier: frontend
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: php-redis
        image: us-docker.pkg.dev/google-samples/containers/gke/gb-frontend:v5
```

**Creating a ReplicaSet**:
```bash
kubectl apply -f https://kubernetes.io/examples/controllers/frontend.yaml
```

### Important ReplicaSet Fields

1. **metadata.name**: Defines the ReplicaSet's name.
2. **spec.replicas**: Number of desired Pods.
3. **spec.selector**: Label selector for Pod identification.
4. **spec.template**: Pod template for new Pods with labels and specifications.

### Managing ReplicaSets

1. **Delete ReplicaSet and Pods**: This removes the ReplicaSet and its dependent Pods.

   ```bash
   kubectl delete rs frontend
   ```

2. **Delete Only the ReplicaSet**: Keeps the Pods running without the ReplicaSet.

   ```bash
   kubectl delete rs frontend --cascade=orphan
   ```

3. **Scaling**: Adjust the number of replicas by updating `.spec.replicas`.

   ```bash
   kubectl scale rs frontend --replicas=5
   ```

### Pod Deletion Cost

Use the `controller.kubernetes.io/pod-deletion-cost` annotation to influence which Pods are removed first during downscaling. Lower values are prioritized for deletion.

### Autoscaling with ReplicaSets

ReplicaSets can be scaled automatically using a **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler** (HPA).

Example HPA YAML:

```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v1
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: frontend-scaler
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    kind: ReplicaSet
    name: frontend
  minReplicas: 3
  maxReplicas: 10
  targetCPUUtilizationPercentage: 50
```

### Alternatives to ReplicaSets

1. **Deployment** (Recommended): Manages ReplicaSets with rolling updates and additional management capabilities.
2. **Bare Pods**: For a single Pod requiring restart on failure; however, ReplicaSets provide better supervision across nodes.
3. **Job**: For batch jobs expected to terminate on completion.
4. **DaemonSet**: For machine-level functions, ensuring one Pod per machine.
5. **ReplicationController**: Similar to ReplicaSets but lacks set-based selectors. ReplicaSets are preferred.
