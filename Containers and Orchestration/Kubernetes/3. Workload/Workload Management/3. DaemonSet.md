A **DaemonSet** in Kubernetes <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">ensures that each node in a cluster runs a copy of a specified Pod</mark>. DaemonSets are essential for managing node-specific applications, such as log collection, monitoring, and network plugins. As nodes join or leave the cluster, Pods are added or removed accordingly.

### Common Use Cases

1. **Cluster Storage Daemons** on every node.
2. **Logs Collection Daemons** on every node.
3. **Node Monitoring Daemons** on every node.

### Writing a DaemonSet Spec

The following is a DaemonSet configuration example for Fluentd:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: fluentd-elasticsearch
  namespace: kube-system
  labels:
    k8s-app: fluentd-logging
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      name: fluentd-elasticsearch
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        name: fluentd-elasticsearch
    spec:
      tolerations:
      - key: node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane
        operator: Exists
        effect: NoSchedule
      - key: node-role.kubernetes.io/master
        operator: Exists
        effect: NoSchedule
      containers:
      - name: fluentd-elasticsearch
        image: quay.io/fluentd_elasticsearch/fluentd:v2.5.2
        resources:
          limits:
            memory: 200Mi
          requests:
            cpu: 100m
            memory: 200Mi
        volumeMounts:
        - name: varlog
          mountPath: /var/log
      terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 30
      volumes:
      - name: varlog
        hostPath:
          path: /var/log
```

Create the DaemonSet by running:

```bash
kubectl apply -f daemonset.yaml
```

### Required Fields

- **apiVersion**, **kind**, and **metadata**: Basic Kubernetes config fields.
- **Pod Template** (`.spec.template`): Must include labels, and the restart policy must be set to `Always`.
- **Pod Selector** (`.spec.selector`): Defines how the DaemonSet selects Pods, which must match `.spec.template.metadata.labels`.

### Node Selection

- **Node Selector** (`.spec.template.spec.nodeSelector`): Creates Pods only on nodes matching specified labels.
- **Node Affinity** (`.spec.template.spec.affinity`): Targets nodes based on affinity rules.
- **Taints and Tolerations**: DaemonSets can tolerate various node conditions, such as disk pressure or memory pressure.

### DaemonSet Scheduling

- The **DaemonSet controller** schedules Pods on eligible nodes by setting the node affinity.
- **Scheduler Customization**: You can specify a different scheduler for DaemonSet Pods by setting `.spec.template.spec.schedulerName`.
  
### Communicating with Daemon Pods

1. **Push Model**: Daemon Pods send data to an external service.
2. **Node IP and Known Port**: Use `hostPort` to make Pods accessible via node IPs.
3. **Headless Service**: Use a headless service for DNS-based discovery.
4. **Service**: Reach a random node's daemon by creating a service.

### Updating a DaemonSet

- DaemonSet Pods are updated automatically when node labels change.
- Deleting a DaemonSet removes its Pods unless `--cascade=orphan` is specified, in which case the new DaemonSet adopts the orphaned Pods.
- **Rolling Updates**: A DaemonSet supports rolling updates, allowing Pods to be updated without disrupting the application.

### Alternatives to DaemonSet

1. **Init Scripts**: Useful for node-level processes but lacks the Kubernetes Pod management features.
2. **Bare Pods**: Can run on specific nodes, but lack DaemonSetâ€™s resilience to failures.
3. **Static Pods**: Configured directly on nodes, independent of Kubernetes API, and may be deprecated.
4. **Deployments**: Ideal for stateless services where node-specific management is unnecessary.

### Example Use Cases

- **Networking Plugins**: Many network components use DaemonSets to ensure that every node has proper networking configuration.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Tools like Fluentd and Prometheus Node Exporter are often deployed as DaemonSets to collect node-level data.
