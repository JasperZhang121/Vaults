CronJobs allow for **automated, repeating Jobs** to execute tasks on a schedule in Kubernetes, similar to a Unix `cron` job.

### Basic Example

The following example CronJob runs every minute, printing the current time and a message:

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: hello
spec:
  schedule: "* * * * *"
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: hello
            image: busybox:1.28
            command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "date; echo Hello from Kubernetes"]
          restartPolicy: OnFailure
```

### Writing a CronJob Spec

1. **Schedule Syntax**: Defined in `spec.schedule` using Cron format.
   - Example: `"0 3 * * 1"` schedules a task every Monday at 3 AM.
   - Macros like `@daily` can simplify common schedules.

2. **Job Template**: Defined in `spec.jobTemplate`, mirroring a standard Job configuration, including metadata and container specifications.

3. **Concurrency Policy**: Defined in `spec.concurrencyPolicy` to control overlapping jobs:
   - **Allow**: Allows concurrent Jobs.
   - **Forbid**: Prevents new Jobs if the previous Job is still running.
   - **Replace**: Replaces the currently running Job with a new one.

4. **Deadline for Delayed Start**: `spec.startingDeadlineSeconds` sets a delay window for when a Job can start late.

5. **Job History Limits**: `spec.successfulJobsHistoryLimit` and `spec.failedJobsHistoryLimit` set limits for retained Job records.

### Time Zone Support

Set `spec.timeZone` to a valid time zone (e.g., `Etc/UTC`) to control the timing relative to a specific time zone.

### Managing Suspended Jobs

Set `spec.suspend` to `true` to pause Job creation. When set back to `false`, any missed Jobs will immediately execute.

### CronJob Limitations and Best Practices

- **Missed Job Limits**: If over 100 missed Jobs are detected, further Jobs are skipped to prevent overload.
- **Clock Skew**: Minor time variations in cluster nodes may lead to Jobs running off schedule.
- **Modifying CronJobs**: Changes to CronJobs affect only future Jobs and not already running Jobs.
