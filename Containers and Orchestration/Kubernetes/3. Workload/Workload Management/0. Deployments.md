Deployments in Kubernetes provide declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets, managing application workloads that do not maintain state.

#### Use Cases for Deployments

1. **Rolling Out a ReplicaSet**: Deployments manage rolling out ReplicaSets to run Pods in the background.
2. **Updating Pods**: Modify Pods by updating the Deployment’s PodTemplateSpec.
3. **Rollback**: Revert to an earlier Deployment if the current revision is unstable.
4. **Scaling**: Scale up or down based on load.
5. **Pause/Resume Rollouts**: Suspend updates to make multiple changes, then resume.
6. **Monitoring Status**: Observe Deployment status to detect if a rollout has stalled.
7. **Cleanup of Old ReplicaSets**: Discard older ReplicaSets not in use.

#### Creating a Deployment Example

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: nginx
          image: nginx:1.14.2
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
```

#### Key Fields in Deployment YAML

1. **metadata.name**: Name of the Deployment.
2. **spec.replicas**: Desired number of Pods.
3. **spec.selector**: Defines label criteria for Pods managed by this Deployment.
4. **spec.template**: Pod configuration template that applies to all Pods in this Deployment.

#### Updating a Deployment

To update a Deployment’s Pod image:

```bash
kubectl set image deployment/nginx-deployment nginx=nginx:1.16.1
```

Check rollout status:

```bash
kubectl rollout status deployment/nginx-deployment
```

This initiates a controlled rollout process where the old ReplicaSet is scaled down and the new one scaled up.

#### Deployment Rollbacks

Rollback to the previous revision if issues arise with the current rollout:

```bash
kubectl rollout undo deployment/nginx-deployment
```

Alternatively, specify a specific revision:

```bash
kubectl rollout undo deployment/nginx-deployment --to-revision=2
```

#### Scaling a Deployment

Scale a Deployment manually:

```bash
kubectl scale deployment/nginx-deployment --replicas=10
```

Or use autoscaling based on CPU utilization:

```bash
kubectl autoscale deployment/nginx-deployment --min=10 --max=15 --cpu-percent=80
```

#### Deployment Strategies

1. **Recreate**: All existing Pods are terminated before new ones are created.
2. **Rolling Update**: Update Pods in a rolling manner, controlled by:
   - **maxUnavailable**: Maximum number of Pods that can be unavailable during the update.
   - **maxSurge**: Maximum number of Pods that can be created above the desired count during the update.

#### Pausing and Resuming Rollouts

Pausing rollouts allows multiple updates to the Pod template without triggering new rollouts:

```bash
kubectl rollout pause deployment/nginx-deployment
```

To apply changes, resume the rollout:

```bash
kubectl rollout resume deployment/nginx-deployment
```

#### Deployment Status Monitoring

1. **Progressing**: Deployment is updating or scaling.
2. **Complete**: All replicas have been updated and are available.
3. **Failed**: Deployment has stalled, possibly due to readiness probe failures, image pull errors, or insufficient resources.

#### Clean Up Policy

The `.spec.revisionHistoryLimit` field specifies the number of old ReplicaSets to retain. Setting it to `0` removes all old ReplicaSets, preventing rollbacks.

#### Deployment Spec Structure

- **Pod Template**: Specifies labels and a restart policy.
- **Replicas**: Desired count of Pods.
- **Selector**: Defines criteria for managed Pods.
- **Strategy**: Defines Pod replacement strategy.

#### Canary Deployment

For a controlled rollout to a subset of users or servers, you can use multiple Deployments following the canary pattern.

#### Additional Deployment Configurations

1. **Min Ready Seconds**: Minimum seconds a Pod must be ready before it is considered available.
2. **Progress Deadline Seconds**: Time allowed for a rollout to progress before it’s marked as stalled.
3. **Paused Field**: Temporarily halts rollouts; changes made do not trigger new rollouts until resumed.
