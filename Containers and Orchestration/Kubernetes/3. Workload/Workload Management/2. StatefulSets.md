A **StatefulSet** is a Kubernetes API object used to manage stateful applications. It maintains a unique, stable identity for each Pod, making it essential for applications that require persistent storage or stable network identities.

### Key Features of StatefulSets

- **Stable Network Identity**: Each Pod has a consistent hostname derived from the StatefulSet and its ordinal.
- **Persistent Storage**: Each Pod can use its own storage, typically via a PersistentVolumeClaim.
- **Ordered Deployment and Scaling**: Pods are created, scaled, and terminated in an ordered sequence.
- **Rolling Updates**: Supports rolling updates for updates to containers, labels, resource requests/limits, and annotations.
### When to Use a StatefulSet

StatefulSets are ideal for applications that require:
1. **Stable Network Identifiers**
2. **Persistent Storage** across Pod restarts
3. **Ordered Deployment, Scaling, and Updates**

For stateless applications, use **Deployments** or **ReplicaSets** instead.

### Example: StatefulSet with Headless Service

This example demonstrates a basic StatefulSet for an `nginx` application with stable storage.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 80
    name: web
  clusterIP: None
  selector:
    app: nginx
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: web
spec:
  serviceName: "nginx"
  replicas: 3
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: registry.k8s.io/nginx-slim:0.24
        volumeMounts:
        - name: www
          mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html
  volumeClaimTemplates:
  - metadata:
      name: www
    spec:
      accessModes: ["ReadWriteOnce"]
      storageClassName: "my-storage-class"
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 1Gi
```

In this example:
- **Headless Service**: Provides network identity management for Pods.
- **Persistent Storage**: Each Pod has its PersistentVolume.
- **VolumeClaimTemplate**: Defines a PersistentVolumeClaim template for each Pod.

### StatefulSet Components

- **Pod Selector**: `.spec.selector` must match `.spec.template.metadata.labels`.
- **VolumeClaimTemplates**: Provides stable storage using PersistentVolumes, provisioned by the specified StorageClass.
- **Minimum Ready Seconds**: Defines how long a Pod should be in a `Ready` state without crashing before considered available.

### Pod Identity in StatefulSets

1. **Ordinal Index**: Each Pod has a unique ordinal index (`0`, `1`, etc.).
2. **Stable Network ID**: Pod hostname follows the pattern: `$(statefulset-name)-$(ordinal)`.
3. **Stable Storage**: Each Pod mounts a PersistentVolume based on the volume claim template, and volumes persist after Pod deletion.

### Deployment and Scaling Guarantees

1. **Sequential Creation**: Pods are created in order from `{0..N-1}`.
2. **Reverse Termination**: Pods are terminated in reverse order `{N-1..0}`.
3. **Dependency Requirements**: A Pod must be `Running` and `Ready` before deploying or terminating its neighboring Pod.

### Pod Management Policies

1. **OrderedReady**: Ensures ordered deployment and termination (default).
2. **Parallel**: Allows Pods to start or terminate in parallel for faster scaling operations.

### Update Strategies

1. **OnDelete**: Requires manual deletion of Pods to apply updates.
2. **RollingUpdate**: Applies automated rolling updates from the highest to lowest ordinal Pod.

**Partitioned Rolling Update**: Allows partial updates based on a specified partition.

### PersistentVolumeClaim Retention

StatefulSets offer a **PersistentVolumeClaim Retention Policy** to control PVC deletion when:
- **whenDeleted**: Retains or deletes PVCs upon StatefulSet deletion.
- **whenScaled**: Retains or deletes PVCs upon downscaling the StatefulSet.

### Scaling and Update Management

1. **Scaling**: Adjusts the number of Pods by changing `.spec.replicas`.
2. **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler**: StatefulSets can work with HPA but avoid setting `.spec.replicas` manually.
