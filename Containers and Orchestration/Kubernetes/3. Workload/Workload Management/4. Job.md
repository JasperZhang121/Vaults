A **Job** in Kubernetes runs tasks that are intended to execute to completion. Jobs create one or more Pods, <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">monitoring successful completions until the desired count is met</mark>, at which point the Job terminates. Jobs are useful for tasks such as batch processing, data transformation, or other one-off tasks.

### Key Features of Jobs

1. **Single-Run Jobs**: Run one Pod to completion.
2. **Retry Policy**: Restarts Pods if they fail, retrying until a specified limit is reached.
3. **Parallel Execution**: Can execute multiple Pods concurrently.

For scheduled Jobs, use **CronJobs**.

### Example Job Configuration

This Job calculates Ï€ to 2000 places and outputs the result.

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: pi
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: pi
        image: perl:5.34.0
        command: ["perl", "-Mbignum=bpi", "-wle", "print bpi(2000)"]
      restartPolicy: Never
  backoffLimit: 4
```

Run the Job with:

```bash
kubectl apply -f job.yaml
```

Check Job status:

```bash
kubectl describe job pi
```

### Writing a Job Spec

- **apiVersion**, **kind**, **metadata**: Required fields for all Kubernetes objects.
- **Pod Template** (`.spec.template`): Defines the Pod configuration, including labels, container specifications, and restart policy. Only `RestartPolicy: Never` or `OnFailure` is allowed.
- **Job Labels**: Use `batch.kubernetes.io/` prefix for job-name and controller-uid labels.

### Job Completion Modes

1. **Non-Parallel Job**: Default, where one Pod runs to completion.
2. **Fixed Completion Count**: Specify `.spec.completions`, indicating the required number of successful Pod runs for the Job to complete.
3. **Work Queue Job**: Pods coordinate work independently, often using a shared queue.

### Controlling Parallelism

- **Parallelism** (`.spec.parallelism`): Sets the number of Pods that run concurrently.
- **Completion Count** (`.spec.completions`): Number of Pods required for successful Job completion.

### Indexed Jobs (Kubernetes v1.24+)

For Jobs with a fixed completion count, **completion modes** control how Pods are indexed. Indexed Jobs create Pods with unique indices, enabling static work assignments.

### Job Failure and Success Policies

1. **Backoff Limit** (`.spec.backoffLimit`): Maximum retry limit for failed Pods.
2. **Pod Failure Policy** (`.spec.podFailurePolicy`): Allows handling specific failure scenarios based on exit codes or conditions.
3. **Success Policy** (`.spec.successPolicy`): Controls when a Job is marked successful based on specified conditions.

### Job Patterns

1. **Queue with Pod Per Work Item**: One Job manages work items queued and processed by multiple Pods.
2. **Indexed Job with Static Work Assignment**: Pods are assigned unique indices, allowing static task assignments.
3. **Job Template Expansion**: Suitable for single-Pod Jobs with one template applied to all Pods.

### Job Termination and Cleanup

- **Active Deadline** (`.spec.activeDeadlineSeconds`): Sets the time limit for Job completion, after which the Job is marked as failed.
- **TTL Mechanism** (`.spec.ttlSecondsAfterFinished`): Automatically deletes completed Jobs after a specified duration, reducing API server load.

### Advanced Job Management

- **Suspending a Job**: Temporarily halts Job execution, stopping active Pods, which are then restarted when the Job resumes.
- **Custom Pod Selectors**: Allows manual selection of Pods in cases where the default selector is not suitable.
- **Job Tracking with Finalizers**: Ensures Pods are accounted for before deletion.

### Alternatives to Jobs

1. **Bare Pods**: Lack resiliency of Jobs but can be useful for simple, single-run tasks.
2. **Replication Controller**: Manages persistent services rather than short-lived Jobs.
3. **Single Job Controller Pod**: Allows a Pod to act as a controller, managing additional Pods for flexible task management.

Jobs are optimal for finite tasks requiring retries and parallelism, with robust options for failure handling, custom scheduling, and completion control.
