### General Configuration Tips

- **Specify Latest API Version**: Use the latest stable API version to ensure compatibility and feature support.
- **Version Control for Configurations**: Store configuration files in version control for easy rollbacks and cluster restoration.
- **YAML Format**: Write configuration files in YAML rather than JSON for readability and usability.
- **Group Related Objects**: Whenever possible, group related objects into a single file. For example, you can use `kubectl apply` on a directory of files.
- **Simplify Defaults**: Avoid specifying default values unless necessary, reducing complexity and potential errors.
- **Annotations for Descriptions**: Use annotations for object descriptions, aiding inspection.

> **Note**: Kubernetes may exhibit compatibility issues with YAML 1.2 boolean values. Use `true` and `false` explicitly instead of `yes` or `no` to avoid errors.


### Best Practices for Pods, ReplicaSets, and Deployments

- **Avoid Naked Pods**: Prefer Deployments or ReplicaSets over standalone Pods. Deployments ensure automatic rescheduling of Pods in case of node failure.
- **Deployment Advantages**: Use Deployments for Pods with a rescheduling strategy, such as `RollingUpdate`.
- **Jobs for Specific Scenarios**: For tasks requiring `restartPolicy: Never`, consider using Jobs instead of Deployments.


### Service Configuration

- **Service Setup Order**: Create Services before their corresponding backend workloads (e.g., Deployments) to ensure environment variables are set in containers at start.
- **DNS in Clusters**: Enabling cluster DNS automates name resolution for Services.
- **Port Exposure**: Avoid `hostPort` unless necessary; it limits scheduling flexibility. Use NodePort or `kubectl port-forward` for debugging.
- **Service Discovery**: Use headless Services (`ClusterIP: None`) for service discovery without kube-proxy load balancing.


### Labeling for Organization and Management

- **Semantic Labels**: Label resources by semantic attributes, like `{ app.kubernetes.io/name: MyApp, tier: frontend }`, for meaningful resource grouping and selection.
- **Version Control via Labels**: Omit release-specific labels from Service selectors to allow multi-version Deployments without downtime.
- **Common Labels**: Use standardized labels for consistency and interoperability across Kubernetes tools.
- **Debugging with Labels**: Modify labels to isolate Pods from controllers for debugging without disrupting production traffic.


### kubectl Command Tips

- **Directory-Based Application**: Use `kubectl apply -f <directory>` for managing multiple configuration files at once.
- **Label Selectors for Operations**: Prefer label selectors over specific names for `kubectl get` and `kubectl delete` commands to simplify resource management.
- **Quick Deployment and Exposure**: Use `kubectl create deployment` and `kubectl expose` to rapidly deploy and expose applications.
