Kubernetes `kubeconfig` files centralize configuration for accessing multiple clusters, users, namespaces, and authentication methods. `kubectl` uses these files to identify clusters and connect with API servers.

> **Note**: `kubeconfig` is a general term for these configuration files, but it does not necessarily indicate a specific filename.


### 1. **Basic Usage of `kubeconfig`**

By default, `kubectl` looks for `config` in `$HOME/.kube`. You can specify alternative files with the **KUBECONFIG** environment variable or `--kubeconfig` flag.

#### Security Warning
Only use trusted `kubeconfig` files. Untrusted files might contain malicious configurations.


### 2. **Supporting Multiple Clusters and Authentication**

`kubeconfig` files allow you to organize clusters, users, and namespaces and set up contexts to switch configurations easily. Typical uses include:

- **Kubelets** authenticate with certificates.
- **Users** may authenticate with tokens or certificates.
  
Each configuration can specify **clusters**, **users**, **contexts**, and **namespaces**.


### 3. **Context Switching**

A context in a `kubeconfig` file groups access settings (cluster, user, namespace) under a name. `kubectl` uses the current context settings to communicate with the cluster.

Switch contexts with:
```shell
kubectl config use-context <context-name>
```


### 4. **Using the `KUBECONFIG` Environment Variable**

The **KUBECONFIG** environment variable holds a colon-separated list of `kubeconfig` files for Linux/Mac (semicolon-separated on Windows). When set, `kubectl` merges the files for an effective configuration.


### 5. **Merging `kubeconfig` Files**

Run the following command to view your current merged configuration:
```shell
kubectl config view
```

#### Merging Rules:
- **Single file specified** via `--kubeconfig`: no merging occurs.
- **Multiple files** listed in **KUBECONFIG**: files are merged.
  - Empty filenames are ignored.
  - Deserialization errors for files with improper formats.
  - For duplicate entries, values in the first file take precedence.
  
#### Default Merge:
If **KUBECONFIG** isn’t set, `kubectl` uses `$HOME/.kube/config`.


### 6. **Context, Cluster, and User Selection**

Order of priority for selecting a **context**:
1. `--context` command-line flag.
2. `current-context` in merged `kubeconfig`.

Order of priority for **cluster** and **user** selection:
1. Command-line flags: `--cluster` or `--user`.
2. Current context’s `cluster` or `user`.
3. Default values or prompts.


### 7. **File References in `kubeconfig`**

File and path references are relative to the file location, with absolute paths stored as-is.


### 8. **Using a Proxy in `kubeconfig`**

You can define a proxy for a cluster using `proxy-url` in your `kubeconfig` file:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Config
clusters:
- cluster:
    proxy-url: http://proxy.example.org:3128
    server: https://k8s.example.org/k8s/clusters/c-xxyyzz
  name: development
users:
- name: developer
contexts:
- context:
  name: development
```
