Windows nodes differ from Linux nodes in how resources like CPU and memory are managed. While Linux nodes use **cgroups** to control resource usage within a pod boundary, Windows nodes utilize **job objects** and **system namespace filtering** to isolate processes within containers.

### 1. **Isolation and Privileges**

- **Linux Nodes**: Use **cgroups** for resource management, allowing CPU, I/O, and memory usage statistics collection.
- **Windows Nodes**: Employ a **job object per container** and system namespace filtering for isolation.
  - **Namespace Filtering**: Ensures containers do not assume host identities, as Security Account Manager (SAM) is separate.
  - **No Privileged Containers**: Due to namespace filtering, privileged containers are unavailable on Windows.

### 2. **Memory Management**

- **Virtual Memory**: Windows treats all user-mode memory as virtual, with mandatory pagefiles.
- **No OOM Killer**: Unlike Linux, Windows does not terminate processes when out of memory. Instead, Windows handles memory over-provisioning through paging.
- **Impact of Over-Provisioning**: Excessive memory usage leads to disk paging, which can slow performance.

### 3. **CPU Management**

- **CPU Allocation**: Windows limits CPU time for processes but lacks a minimum guaranteed CPU time allocation.
- **Kubelet Priority Setting**:
  - Set with the `--windows-priorityclass` flag to prioritize the kubelet process, avoiding starvation.
  - Recommended settings: `ABOVE_NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS` or higher to ensure kubelet has sufficient CPU cycles.

### 4. **Resource Reservation**

To account for OS, container runtime, and Kubernetes host process usage, reserve memory and CPU with `--kube-reserved` and/or `--system-reserved` flags. These reservations affect the **node’s allocatable resources** in Windows:

- **Best Practices**:
  - Set **resource limits** for memory and CPU on containers to avoid over-provisioning, which can destabilize nodes.
  - Reserve a minimum of **2GiB memory**.
  - For CPU, determine requirements by observing system services’ CPU usage under the maximum pod density.
