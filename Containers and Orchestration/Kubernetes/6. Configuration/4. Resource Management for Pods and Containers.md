Resource management in Kubernetes allows you to <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">define CPU, memory (RAM), and other resource requirements</mark> for containers within Pods. Specifying these needs enables Kubernetes to efficiently allocate resources, ensuring system stability and optimizing application performance.

### 1. **Requests and Limits**

- **Requests**: The minimum resources Kubernetes reserves for a container. Requests influence Pod scheduling to ensure it has a node with sufficient resources.
- **Limits**: The maximum resources a container can use. The kubelet enforces these limits to prevent containers from consuming excessive resources, potentially affecting other containers on the node.

> If a limit is specified without a request, Kubernetes assumes the limit as the request.


### 2. **Resource Types**

- **CPU**: Represented in Kubernetes units, where 1 CPU equates to 1 physical core or 1 vCPU. Partial units (e.g., 500m for half a CPU) are allowed.
- **Memory**: Defined in bytes with optional suffixes (e.g., Mi, Gi) to denote units.

> Other specialized resources include **huge pages** (large memory blocks) and **local ephemeral storage**.


### 3. **Pod and Container Resource Definitions**

Resources are defined per container within a Pod. Key specifications include:

- **spec.containers[].resources.requests.cpu**: Request CPU units.
- **spec.containers[].resources.limits.memory**: Limit memory usage.
  
For example, a Pod with two containers can have individual CPU and memory limits, which sum to the Pod’s total request and limit.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: frontend
spec:
  containers:
    - name: app
      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: "250m"
          memory: "64Mi"
        limits:
          cpu: "500m"
          memory: "128Mi"
    - name: log-aggregator
      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: "250m"
          memory: "64Mi"
        limits:
          cpu: "500m"
          memory: "128Mi"
```


### 4. **Resource Units**

- **CPU**: Specified in units (1 CPU = 1 core). Lower units (e.g., 100m for 0.1 CPU) are supported.
- **Memory**: Expressed in bytes, with suffixes for larger units (e.g., Mi, Gi).
  
> Always use standard units for consistency.


### 5. **Ephemeral Storage Management**

- **ephemeral-storage**: Local, non-persistent storage for temporary data.
- **emptyDir volumes**: Memory-backed volumes useful for high-performance applications needing temporary data storage.
  
To manage ephemeral storage, set limits and requests for **ephemeral-storage** within Pod specifications.


### 6. **Pod Scheduling with Resource Requests**

The scheduler allocates Pods to nodes with sufficient resources based on defined requests. Even if a node’s overall usage is low, a Pod won’t be scheduled if the requested resources exceed the node’s remaining capacity.


### 7. **Resource Monitoring and Limits Enforcement**

- **CPU**: Limits are enforced by scheduling restrictions. Exceeding limits throttles CPU usage.
- **Memory**: Exceeding memory limits results in OOM (Out of Memory) errors, terminating the process in violation.
  
The kubelet reports resource usage via the Metrics API, allowing real-time monitoring of resource consumption.


### 8. **Extended Resources**

Kubernetes supports custom resources beyond CPU and memory, such as GPUs or custom hardware:

- **Node-Level Resources**: Configured at the node, such as GPUs or other hardware.
- **Cluster-Level Resources**: Managed by scheduler extenders and often pertain to specialized hardware not bound to specific nodes.


### 9. **Troubleshooting Resource Issues**

- **Pending Pods**: If a Pod cannot be scheduled due to insufficient resources, it remains pending. Check events for error messages, such as `insufficient cpu`.
- **Terminated Containers**: Containers may be terminated if they exceed resource limits. Use `kubectl describe pod` to check termination reasons, such as `OOMKilled` for memory overuse.
