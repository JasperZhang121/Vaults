Kubernetes uses three types of probes to monitor the health and state of containers:

1. **Liveness Probe**
2. **Readiness Probe**
3. **Startup Probe**

These probes help ensure that applications run smoothly by allowing Kubernetes to manage container lifecycles based on the application's health and readiness.


### 1. Liveness Probe

- **Purpose**: To determine when a container should be restarted.
- **Use Case**: Detects issues like deadlocks where an application is running but stuck or unresponsive.
- **Behavior**: If the liveness probe fails, Kubernetes restarts the container.
- **Configuration**: You can use `initialDelaySeconds` to delay the start of the probe or use a **Startup Probe** to handle slower-starting applications.

> **Note**: Liveness probes start immediately and do not depend on readiness probes.


### 2. Readiness Probe

- **Purpose**: To determine when a container is ready to accept traffic.
- **Use Case**: Useful for applications with an initialization period, such as setting up network connections or loading resources.
- **Behavior**: If the readiness probe fails, Kubernetes removes the Pod from service endpoints, which means it won’t receive traffic.
- **Execution**: Readiness probes run throughout the container’s lifecycle.

> **Note**: Kubernetes will wait for the readiness probe to pass before routing traffic to the container.


### 3. Startup Probe

- **Purpose**: To ensure that a containerized application has started before liveness or readiness probes are executed.
- **Use Case**: Useful for slow-starting applications that need more time to initialize.
- **Behavior**: Disables liveness and readiness probes until the startup probe succeeds.
- **Execution**: This probe runs only at the container startup, unlike liveness and readiness probes, which run periodically.


### Configuring Probes

Each probe type can be configured using several parameters:
- **Initial Delay**: Defines how long to wait before starting the probe.
- **Timeout**: Specifies the timeout duration for the probe.
- **Period**: Sets the interval between probe executions.
