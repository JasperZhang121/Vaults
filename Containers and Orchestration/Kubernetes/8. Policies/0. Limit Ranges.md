**LimitRanges** are policies that control resource allocation within a Kubernetes namespace, providing limits on CPU, memory, and storage usage for Pods and Containers. These policies help ensure resources are shared equitably and prevent a single object from monopolizing available resources.

### 1. **Purpose and Functions of LimitRanges**

A LimitRange enforces constraints within a namespace by:
- Setting minimum and maximum compute resources for each Pod or Container.
- Setting storage request limits for PersistentVolumeClaims.
- Enforcing ratios between resource requests and limits.
- Defining default resource requests and limits, which are applied if not explicitly set in the Pod or Container spec.


### 2. **How LimitRanges Work**

1. **Creation**:
   - A cluster or namespace administrator creates a LimitRange within a namespace.
  
2. **Enforcement**:
   - The LimitRange admission controller enforces default values on resources without specified limits.
   - It also ensures that any requested resources do not exceed the defined maximum or fall below the minimum constraints.

3. **Validation**:
   - When a user creates or updates an object, like a Pod, violating the LimitRange, the API server returns a `403 Forbidden` error.
   - **Example**: If a Pod specifies a CPU request of 700m where the limit is capped at 500m, it will fail with an error.

4. **Order of Application**:
   - If multiple LimitRange objects are in place, the default value application may not be deterministic.


### 3. **Key Constraints and Behavior**

- **Compute Constraints**: 
  - Example: CPU minimum of 100m and maximum of 1 CPU; default CPU request/limit can be set to 500m.
  
- **Storage Constraints**:
  - Example: Setting minimum and maximum storage values for PersistentVolumeClaims within the namespace.

- **Scheduling**:
  - LimitRange validations occur only during the Pod admission stage. Once a Pod is running, changes in LimitRange won’t impact it.
  - If both request and limit are set within constraints, the Pod can be scheduled successfully.


### 4. **Example Configurations**

- **CPU and Memory Constraints**:
   - **Example**: In a namespace, configure Pods to request a minimum of 100m CPU and 200Mi memory, with a maximum limit of 500m CPU and 600Mi memory.

- **Default Values**:
   - **Example**: Set default CPU request to 150m and memory to 300Mi, which apply to Containers that don’t specify these resources.


### 5. **Limitations and Considerations**

- **Resource Contention**:
   - If total namespace limits are less than the aggregate limits of individual Pods or Containers, resource contention may occur, blocking new Pod creation.

- **Impact on Existing Resources**:
   - Changes to a LimitRange won’t affect already created Pods or Containers in that namespace.
