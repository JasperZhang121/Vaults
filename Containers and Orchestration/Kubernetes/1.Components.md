### Overview of Kubernetes Components

A Kubernetes cluster is primarily composed of **control nodes** (master) and **worker nodes** (node). Each type of node hosts specific components with distinct responsibilities.

#### Control Node (Master):
The control plane is crucial for making global decisions about the cluster, as well as detecting and responding to cluster events.
  - **API Server**: Serves as the gateway for all cluster operations, handling user commands, authentication, authorization, API registration, and discovery.
  - **Scheduler**: Allocates Pods to nodes based on resource availability and scheduling policies.
  - **Controller Manager**: Oversees various controllers that regulate the cluster state, managing routine tasks such as deployment, auto-scaling, and rolling updates.
  - **Etcd**: A consistent and highly-available data store that retains all cluster data.

#### Worker Node (Node):
Worker nodes manage the running of applications and workloads.
  - **Kubelet**: Acts as a node agent, managing the lifecycle of containers on the node by interacting with container runtimes like Docker.
  - **KubeProxy**: Manages network communication within the cluster, providing service discovery and load balancing for services.
  - **Docker**: Handles the runtime environment for containers, ensuring they are pulled, started, stopped, and managed correctly.

### Example of Kubernetes Component Interaction

To illustrate how components interact within a Kubernetes cluster, consider the deployment process of an Nginx service:

1. Both control and worker nodes initialize by storing their state information in **etcd**.
2. A request to deploy an Nginx service is sent to the **API Server** on the control node.
3. The **API Server** queries the **Scheduler** to select an appropriate worker node for running the Nginx service, based on current resource usage and policies.
4. Upon determining the suitable node, the **API Server** instructs the **Controller Manager** to initiate the deployment on the selected node.
5. The **Kubelet** on the assigned worker node then instructs the container runtime, **Docker**, to start the Nginx container within a new Pod.
6. Once deployed, **KubeProxy** facilitates external access to the Nginx service by routing traffic to the appropriate Pod.

### Kubernetes Concepts

- **Master**: The central control node that manages the cluster, ensuring that its state matches the desired configuration.
- **Node**: A worker machine in Kubernetes that hosts Pods and is managed by the master.
- **Pod**: The smallest deployable unit created and managed by Kubernetes, which can contain one or more containers.
- **Controller**: A non-terminating loop that regulates the state of Pods and other resource objects within the cluster.
- **Service**: Provides a consistent endpoint for accessing deployed containers, which can scale up or down.
- **Label**: Key/value pairs attached to objects such as Pods, for purposes of organization and selection.
- **Namespace**: Supports multiple virtual clusters backed by the same physical cluster, providing scope for names and resource management.
