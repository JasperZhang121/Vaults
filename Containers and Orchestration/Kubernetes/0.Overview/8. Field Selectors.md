Field selectors allow you to <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">filter Kubernetes objects based on specific resource field values</mark>. Below is an organized explanation of how to use field selectors, including examples, supported fields, and operators.

#### Examples of Field Selector Queries

You can use field selectors to target specific fields of Kubernetes resources. Here are some example queries:

- `metadata.name=my-service`
- `metadata.namespace!=default`
- `status.phase=Pending`

Example: To select all Pods where the `status.phase` is `Running`:
```bash
kubectl get pods --field-selector status.phase=Running
```

**Note:**  
Field selectors are filters applied to resources. By default, no selectors are applied, meaning all resources of the specified type are selected. For example, these commands are equivalent:
```bash
kubectl get pods
kubectl get pods --field-selector ""
```

#### Supported Fields

Field selectors differ depending on the Kubernetes resource type. All resource types support `metadata.name` and `metadata.namespace`. Using an unsupported field selector will produce an error.

Example of an unsupported field selector:
```bash
kubectl get ingress --field-selector foo.bar=baz
```
Error message:
```bash
Error from server (BadRequest): Unable to find "ingresses" that match label selector "", field selector "foo.bar=baz": "foo.bar" is not a known field selector: only "metadata.name", "metadata.namespace"
```

#### List of Supported Fields

| **Resource Kind**           | **Supported Fields**                                         |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Pod**                     | `spec.nodeName`, `spec.restartPolicy`, `spec.schedulerName`, `spec.serviceAccountName`, `spec.hostNetwork`, `status.phase`, `status.podIP`, `status.nominatedNodeName` |
| **Event**                   | `involvedObject.kind`, `involvedObject.namespace`, `involvedObject.name`, `involvedObject.uid`, `involvedObject.apiVersion`, `involvedObject.resourceVersion`, `involvedObject.fieldPath`, `reason`, `reportingComponent`, `source`, `type` |
| **Secret**                  | `type`                                                       |
| **Namespace**               | `status.phase`                                               |
| **ReplicaSet**              | `status.replicas`                                            |
| **ReplicationController**   | `status.replicas`                                            |
| **Job**                     | `status.successful`                                          |
| **Node**                    | `spec.unschedulable`                                         |
| **CertificateSigningRequest** | `spec.signerName`                                           |

#### Supported Operators

You can use the following operators with field selectors:

- `=` or `==` (equivalent)
- `!=`

Example: Select all services that are not in the `default` namespace:
```bash
kubectl get services --all-namespaces --field-selector metadata.namespace!=default
```

**Note:**  
Set-based operators (`in`, `notin`, `exists`) are **not** supported for field selectors.

#### Chained Selectors

Multiple field selectors can be chained together using a comma-separated list.

Example: Select all Pods where the `status.phase` is not `Running` and the `spec.restartPolicy` is `Always`:
```bash
kubectl get pods --field-selector=status.phase!=Running,spec.restartPolicy=Always
```

#### Using Field Selectors Across Multiple Resource Types

You can apply field selectors across multiple resource types.

Example: Select all StatefulSets and Services that are not in the `default` namespace:
```bash
kubectl get statefulsets,services --all-namespaces --field-selector metadata.namespace!=default
```

### Example

#### Scenario:
You have a Kubernetes cluster with multiple Pods running, and you want to filter only those that are in a specific phase (`Running`) and are scheduled to a particular node (`node-1`).

#### Step-by-Step Example:

##### 1. **Basic Query: Filter Pods by Status**
You want to retrieve all Pods that are currently in the `Running` phase.

```bash
kubectl get pods --field-selector status.phase=Running
```
This will return all Pods where the field `status.phase` equals `Running`. This is useful when you're only interested in Pods that are actively running.

##### 2. **Chained Query: Filter by Status and Node**
Now, let's say you want to filter further and only see Pods that are `Running` **and** are scheduled on a specific node, `node-1`.

```bash
kubectl get pods --field-selector status.phase=Running,spec.nodeName=node-1
```
In this query, you're using two field selectors:
- `status.phase=Running`: to get only running Pods.
- `spec.nodeName=node-1`: to get only Pods scheduled on the node named `node-1`.

This will return Pods that satisfy both conditions: they must be running and scheduled on `node-1`.

##### 3. **Using Inequality: Filter Pods Not in Pending Phase**
Now, you want to retrieve all Pods that are **not** in the `Pending` phase.

```bash
kubectl get pods --field-selector status.phase!=Pending
```
Here, the selector `status.phase!=Pending` excludes all Pods in the Pending phase and shows all other Pods.

##### 4. **Multiple Resources: Services and StatefulSets**
Finally, if you want to query multiple resource types, such as all Services and StatefulSets that are **not** in the `default` namespace, you can use this command:

```bash
kubectl get statefulsets,services --all-namespaces --field-selector metadata.namespace!=default
```
This command filters both `statefulsets` and `services`, ensuring that only those **outside** the `default` namespace are shown.

#### Explanation of Output:

- **Field Selectors** act as filters based on the values of specific resource fields.
- **Chained Queries** allow combining multiple conditions using a comma-separated list (e.g., `status.phase!=Pending,spec.nodeName=node-1`).
- **Supported Operators** include `=`, `==`, and `!=`, but advanced operators like `in` or `notin` are not supported.
