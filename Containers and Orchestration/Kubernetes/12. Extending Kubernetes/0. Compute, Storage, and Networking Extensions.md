Kubernetes allows for extending cluster capabilities through compute, storage, and networking plugins that integrate external functionalities. These extensions enable enhanced operations for nodes, storage, and network infrastructure within the cluster.

### Storage Extensions

#### CSI and FlexVolume Storage Plugins
- **Container Storage Interface (CSI)**: CSI plugins enable Kubernetes to support new volume types, which may be:
  - Durable (persistent external storage)
  - Ephemeral
  - Read-only
- **FlexVolume Plugins**: Deprecated as of Kubernetes v1.23, FlexVolume plugins allow non-native volume mounting by calling a binary plugin for volumes in Pods. CSI is now the recommended approach.
- **Resources**:
  - [FlexVolume Design Proposal (archived)](link-to-proposal) for FlexVolume implementation details.
  - [Kubernetes Volume Plugin FAQ for Storage Vendors](link-to-FAQ) for vendor-specific information.

### Compute Extensions

#### Device Plugins
- Device plugins expand node resources, allowing nodes to recognize additional local facilities beyond built-in resources (e.g., CPU, memory).
- Once recognized, these resources can be requested by Pods, enhancing node-local compute capabilities for specialized workloads.

### Networking Extensions

#### Network Plugins
- **Purpose**: Network plugins provide Kubernetes with the necessary network fabric to establish and maintain Pod networks and enable other aspects of the Kubernetes network model.
- **Compatibility**: Kubernetes 1.31 is compatible with CNI (Container Network Interface) plugins, ensuring broad support for various networking topologies and technologies across environments.
