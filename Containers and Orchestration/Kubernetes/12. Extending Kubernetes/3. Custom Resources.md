Custom resources in Kubernetes allow extending the API by adding new resource types, which can be managed similarly to built-in resources like Pods and Services. They are beneficial for storing custom configurations, implementing custom logic through controllers, and enhancing Kubernetes functionality by incorporating domain-specific knowledge or API patterns.

### Types of Custom Resources

1. **CustomResourceDefinition (CRD)**:
   - **Ease of Use**: Created without programming; simply define the schema.
   - **Management**: Managed directly by the main API server.
   - **Use Case**: Suitable for internal resources within a company or small projects.

2. **API Aggregation (AA)**:
   - **Flexibility**: Requires programming and provides advanced API features like custom storage, multiple versions, and additional subresources.
   - **Management**: Runs as an independent API server, managed by the main API server.
   - **Use Case**: Ideal for APIs needing unique behavior or commercial-grade flexibility.

### Custom Controllers

- **Function**: Combine CRDs with custom controllers to enforce the desired state. They keep the declared state consistent with the cluster state.
- **Operator Pattern**: Combines CRDs and controllers to encapsulate domain knowledge, allowing automation and complex lifecycle management.

### Declarative vs. Imperative APIs

- **Declarative API**: Preferred for CRUD operations, low-frequency updates, and structured configuration storage.
- **Imperative API**: Suited for high-bandwidth, synchronous operations, or when handling complex actions that don’t fit CRUD patterns.

**ConfigMap vs. Custom Resource**:
   - Use **ConfigMap** if it represents configuration files consumed by applications within Pods.
   - Use **Custom Resource** if it requires top-level Kubernetes support, including kubectl interaction, or automation via controllers.

### Adding Custom Resources: CRD vs. API Aggregation

| Feature                    | CRD                       | Aggregated API                      |
|----------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Programming**            | Not required              | Required                             |
| **Deployment**             | Handled by main API       | Additional API server needed         |
| **Versioning**             | Simple                    | Supports multiple API versions       |
| **Validation**             | Basic via OpenAPI         | Full validation capability           |
| **Defaulting**             | OpenAPI-based defaults    | Fully customizable                   |
| **Custom Storage**         | No                        | Yes                                  |
| **Custom Logic**           | Limited via Webhooks      | Full flexibility                     |

**Common Features**: Both CRDs and AA support CRUD operations, Watch, Discovery, Patch, HTTPS, RBAC, Finalizers, and more.

### Preparation for Installing Custom Resources

1. **Third-Party Code**: Custom resources often come with supporting controllers or third-party services. When using Aggregated APIs, expect an additional Deployment.
2. **Storage and Authentication**: Custom resources consume storage, requiring sufficient resources. They use the core API server’s authentication and RBAC.
3. **RBAC Configuration**: New roles may need to be created for custom resources if existing roles do not grant access.

### Accessing Custom Resources

- **kubectl**: Custom resources support kubectl commands.
- **Dynamic Clients**: Use Kubernetes dynamic clients for programming custom resources.
- **REST APIs**: Access custom resources via REST clients.
- **Field Selectors**: Supported for custom resources; metadata fields like `.metadata.name` and `.metadata.namespace` are selectable. Additional fields can be made selectable via the `selectableFields` option in CRDs.


### Example: CustomResourceDefinition with Selectable Fields

```yaml
apiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1
kind: CustomResourceDefinition
metadata:
  name: shirts.stable.example.com
spec:
  group: stable.example.com
  scope: Namespaced
  names:
    plural: shirts
    singular: shirt
    kind: Shirt
  versions:
  - name: v1
    served: true
    storage: true
    schema:
      openAPIV3Schema:
        type: object
        properties:
          spec:
            type: object
            properties:
              color:
                type: string
              size:
                type: string
    selectableFields:
    - jsonPath: .spec.color
    - jsonPath: .spec.size
```

**Usage**:
```bash
kubectl get shirts.stable.example.com --field-selector spec.color=blue
```

**Output**:
```plaintext
NAME       COLOR  SIZE
example1   blue   S
example2   blue   M
```
