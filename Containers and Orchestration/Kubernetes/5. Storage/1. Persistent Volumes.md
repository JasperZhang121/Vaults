### Persistent Volumes in Kubernetes

This document provides an overview of persistent volumes (PVs) in Kubernetes, including the API resources **PersistentVolume** and **PersistentVolumeClaim**. For optimal understanding, familiarity with **Volumes**, **StorageClasses**, and **VolumeAttributesClasses** is suggested.

### Introduction

Managing storage in Kubernetes involves abstracting storage details from compute resources:
- **PersistentVolume (PV)**: A storage resource provisioned by an administrator or dynamically through StorageClasses. PVs have a lifecycle independent of Pods.
- **PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC)**: A request for storage that enables users to consume PVs without managing underlying storage implementation details.

Kubernetes includes **StorageClasses** to manage PV properties (e.g., performance) without exposing implementation specifics to users.

### Lifecycle of a PV and PVC

1. **Provisioning**:
   - **Static Provisioning**: Admins create PVs manually, making storage available for cluster users.
   - **Dynamic Provisioning**: When no suitable PV exists, the cluster can dynamically provision storage through a specified StorageClass.
   
2. **Binding**:
   - PVCs request storage resources, and the control plane binds them to available PVs, creating a one-to-one mapping.
   
3. **Usage**:
   - Pods use PVCs as volumes, allowing access to the claimed PVs. The PV remains bound to the PVC as long as needed.

4. **Storage Object in Use Protection**:
   - This feature protects PVCs in use by Pods and PVs bound to PVCs from deletion to prevent data loss.

5. **Reclaiming**:
   - When a PVC is no longer needed, users can delete it, triggering the PV's reclaim policy:
     - **Retain**: Manual clean-up required.
     - **Delete**: Automatically deletes PV and external storage.
     - **Recycle** (deprecated): Clears volume data for reuse.

### Persistent Volume Properties

1. **Capacity**: Specifies PV storage size. Future versions may support additional attributes like IOPS and throughput.

2. **Volume Modes**:
   - **Filesystem**: Default mode, providing a mounted directory.
   - **Block**: Exposes raw block device for direct Pod access.

3. **Access Modes**:
   - **ReadWriteOnce (RWO)**: Single node, read-write.
   - **ReadOnlyMany (ROX)**: Multiple nodes, read-only.
   - **ReadWriteMany (RWX)**: Multiple nodes, read-write.
   - **ReadWriteOncePod (RWOP)**: Exclusive access by a single Pod.

4. **Class**:
   - Defined by `storageClassName`. A PV with a specific class can only bind to PVCs requesting that class.

5. **Reclaim Policy**:
   - Defines post-deletion actions, including Retain, Delete, and (deprecated) Recycle.

6. **Mount Options**:
   - Optional settings (e.g., `hard`, `nfsvers=4.1`) for mounting PVs on nodes.

7. **Node Affinity**:
   - Specifies node constraints for PV accessibility.

8. **Phase**:
   - The PV lifecycle phases: **Available**, **Bound**, **Released**, and **Failed**.

### Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs)

1. **Access Modes & Volume Modes**:
   - PVCs request specific storage access and consumption modes (filesystem or block).

2. **Resources**:
   - PVCs request storage capacity (e.g., `8Gi`).

3. **Selector**:
   - Labels and expressions to match PVs with specific attributes.

4. **Class**:
   - PVCs can specify a StorageClass; if none is provided, a default StorageClass may be applied.

### Advanced Features

1. **Expanding Persistent Volumes**:
   - PVCs can be expanded if `allowVolumeExpansion` is enabled in the StorageClass.

2. **Volume Cloning & Snapshots**:
   - Volume Snapshots and cloning are supported for CSI volumes.

3. **Volume Populators and Cross-namespace Data Sources**:
   - Allows custom sources for populating volumes using dataSourceRef fields.

4. **Raw Block Volume Support**:
   - Some volume plugins (CSI, FC, iSCSI) support raw block devices, enabling low-latency access.

### Using Claims as Volumes

Pods access storage by referencing PVCs in their configuration. The volume is then mounted for the Podâ€™s use. PVCs are namespaced, and cross-namespace mounting is restricted to claims with "Many" access modes.
