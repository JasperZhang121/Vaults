In Kubernetes, **volume limits** specify the maximum number of storage volumes that can be attached to a single node. These limits ensure that the scheduler does not over-assign volumes, which could lead to scheduling issues or nodes reaching their capacity limits.

### Kubernetes Default Volume Limits

By default, Kubernetes enforces specific volume limits for different cloud providers:

| Cloud Provider            | Max Volumes per Node |
|---------------------------|----------------------|
| Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) | 39                  |
| Google Persistent Disk           | 16                  |
| Microsoft Azure Disk Storage     | 16                  |

### Custom Volume Limits

Administrators can modify these limits by setting the `KUBE_MAX_PD_VOLS` environment variable before starting the scheduler. However, if increasing these values, verify with the cloud provider to ensure that the nodes can handle the higher limit.

> **Note**: The custom limit applies to all nodes within the cluster, so changes should be made with caution to prevent any unintended cluster-wide impact.

### Dynamic Volume Limits

**Feature State**: Kubernetes v1.17 [Stable]

Kubernetes supports **dynamic volume limits** for certain volume types, allowing for more flexibility in volume assignments based on node type and cloud provider.

1. **Supported Volume Types**:
   - Amazon EBS
   - Google Persistent Disk
   - Azure Disk
   - CSI (Container Storage Interface)

2. **Limit Determination**:
   - For **in-tree volume plugins**, Kubernetes automatically enforces limits based on the node type.
     - **Google Compute Engine**: Up to 127 volumes, depending on the node type.
     - **Amazon EC2 (EBS)**: 
       - M5, C5, R5, T3, and Z1D instance types support up to 25 volumes.
       - Other instance types allow up to 39 volumes.
     - **Azure**: Allows up to 64 disks per node, depending on the VM type (see [Azure VM Sizes](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/sizes)).

3. **CSI Storage Drivers**:
   - For volumes managed by CSI drivers, Kubernetes respects the maximum volume limit set by the CSI driver using the `NodeGetInfo` method.
   - When in-tree plugins are migrated to a CSI driver, the maximum volume count reflects the CSI driverâ€™s limit.
