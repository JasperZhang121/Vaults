Kubernetes **volume health monitoring** for Container Storage Interface (CSI) volumes enables the detection and reporting of abnormal volume conditions, which may affect PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) or Pods. This monitoring feature consists of two main components: the **External Health Monitor Controller** and **kubelet**.

### Overview

CSI volume health monitoring:
- **Detects abnormal conditions** on CSI volumes.
- **Reports events** on PVCs or Pods based on the source of the detected issue.
- Relies on support from CSI drivers, which must be configured to use either the controller or node side of the monitoring feature.

### Volume Health Monitoring Components

1. **External Health Monitor Controller**:
   - Monitors **abnormal volume conditions** and **node failures**.
   - Reports issues directly on the related PVC.
   - **Node Failure Events**: The `enable-node-watcher` flag must be set to `true` for node failure monitoring.
     - When node failure occurs, an event is added to the PVC indicating that associated Pods are on a failed node.

2. **Kubelet**:
   - Monitors health status for each Pod using the PVC.
   - **Metrics Reporting**:
     - Exposes health status via `kubelet_volume_stats_health_status_abnormal` metric.
     - **Metric Labels**: Includes `namespace` and `persistentvolumeclaim`.
     - **Metric Values**: `1` indicates the volume is unhealthy, `0` indicates a healthy volume.

### Usage Considerations

- **CSI Driver Requirements**: CSI drivers must support the Volume Health Monitoring feature on either the **controller side** or **node side** (or both) to use these features.
- **Metrics Monitoring**: For in-depth health tracking, integrate `kubelet_volume_stats_health_status_abnormal` metric monitoring within cluster monitoring tools.
