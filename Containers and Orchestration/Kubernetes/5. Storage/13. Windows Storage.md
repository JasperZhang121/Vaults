### Persistent Storage in Windows Containers

Windows containers in Kubernetes have unique constraints and features when it comes to persistent storage:

- **File System**: Uses a layered NTFS-based filesystem within the container, meaning file paths resolve only within the container context.
- **Volume Mounting**:
  - Only **directories** can be mounted, not individual files (for Docker; does not apply to containerd).
  - **No Host Projection**: Volume mounts do not project files or directories back to the host.
  - **Read-Only Volumes**: Supported, though a fully read-only root filesystem is not due to the requirement for write access for the Windows registry and the SAM database.
  - **Permissions**: Volume user masks and permissions are not mapped between the host and the container since the Security Account Manager (SAM) is isolated within the container.

### Unsupported Storage Functionalities on Windows Nodes

Due to the specifics of Windows containers, the following storage functionalities are **not supported**:

1. **Subpath Volume Mounts**: Only the entire volume can be mounted.
2. **Subpath for Secrets**: Mounting specific paths within secrets volumes is unsupported.
3. **Host Mount Projection**: Cannot map back to the host filesystem.
4. **Read-Only Root Filesystem**: Root filesystem cannot be fully read-only (though individual volumes can be).
5. **Block Device Mapping**: Not supported.
6. **Memory as Storage Medium**: `emptyDir.medium` set to memory is unsupported.
7. **Filesystem Features like UID/GID**: No user-specific permissions.
8. **Secret Permissions via DefaultMode**: Requires UID/GID settings not available in Windows.
9. **NFS-Based Storage**: Unsupported.
10. **Volume Expansion**: Resizing mounted volumes (resizefs) is not supported.

### Volume Management on Windows

Kubernetes supports **persistent volumes** to facilitate data persistence and sharing between Pods, with the ability to provision, attach, detach, and manage volumes on Windows nodes. Windows volume management includes:

- **Volume Plugins**: Windows in Kubernetes supports volume plugins for managing volumes:
  - **CSI Plugins**: Recommended for modern and flexible volume handling.
  - **In-Tree Volume Plugins**: Supports Azure (`azureFile`) and vSphere (`vsphereVolume`) volumes.
  - **FlexVolume Plugins**: Although supported, FlexVolumes are deprecated as of Kubernetes v1.23 and should be replaced with CSI plugins.
