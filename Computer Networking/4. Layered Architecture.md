### Importance of Computer Network Layered Architecture:

-   The layered architecture’s major goal is to split the design into tiny parts.
-   Each lower layer contributes its services to the top layer, resulting in a complete collection of services for managing communications and running applications.
-   It provides modularity and explicit interfaces, allowing subsystems to interact with one another.
-   It ensures layer independence by offering services from the lowest to the highest layer without specifying how the services are implemented. As a result, any changes made to one layer have no effect on the other levels.
-   The number of levels, functions, and contents of each layer will differ from one network to the next. However, the objective of each layer is to offer the service from a lower to a higher layer while masking the specifics of how the services are performed from the layers.

### Fundamental Components of Layered Architecture:

Services, protocols, and interfaces are the fundamental components of layered architecture.

#### 1. Service:

A collection of activities provided by a layer to a higher layer.

#### 2. Protocol:

It is a collection of rules that a layer employs to share data with a peer entity.  
These rules primarily address the contents and order of the messages used.

#### 3. Interface:

The interface is the means through which a message is transmitted from one layer to another.

In a layer n architecture, layer n on one computer communicates with layer n on another machine, and the rules employed in the interaction are referred to as a layer-n protocol.

### Features of Layered Architecture:

-   In the case of layered architecture, no data is transmitted from one machine’s layer n to another machine’s layer n. Instead, until the lowest layer is reached, each layer transmits the data to the one directly below it.
-   The physical channel via which real communication takes place is located underneath layer 1.
-   Unmanageable activities are split into smaller, more manageable jobs in a layered architecture.
-   Data is sent from the upper layer to the bottom layer via an interface. A layered design provides a clear interface so that only the most important information is communicated across levels. It also assures that one layer’s implementation may be readily changed by another.
