1. Routing Basics:

- Routing is the process of <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">directing network traffic between different networks or subnets</mark>.
- Routers are devices that facilitate routing by making decisions on how to forward packets based on their destination IP addresses.
- Routing enables communication between devices in different networks and ensures that packets take the most efficient path to their destinations.

2. Routing Tables:

- Each router maintains a routing table, which is a <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">database containing information about known networks and the paths to reach them</mark>.
- The routing table consists of entries that include network prefixes (IP address ranges) and the corresponding next-hop or outgoing interface to reach those networks.
- Routing tables are populated through manual configuration or dynamically through routing protocols.

3. Routing Protocols:

- Routing protocols are a set of rules and algorithms that routers use to exchange <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">routing information and update their routing tables</mark>.
- Interior Gateway Protocols (IGPs) are used for routing within an autonomous system (AS), such as a local network. Examples include Routing Information Protocol (RIP), Open Shortest Path First (OSPF), and Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (IGRP).
- Exterior Gateway Protocols (EGPs) are used for routing between different autonomous systems, typically on the internet. Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is the most commonly used EGP.

4. Routing Algorithms:

- Routing algorithms are used by routers to determine the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">best path for forwarding packets</mark> based on the information in the routing table.
- Distance-Vector Routing: This algorithm calculates the distance (cost) to each network based on metrics like hop count or bandwidth. Examples include RIP and IGRP.
- Link-State Routing: This algorithm builds a complete topology of the network by exchanging information about network links. Examples include OSPF and IS-IS.
- Path-Vector Routing: This algorithm records the entire path to a network and shares it with other routers. BGP is an example of a path-vector routing protocol.

5. Static Routing:

- Static routing is a manual method of configuring routing entries in a routing table.
- With static routing, network administrators manually specify the paths to reach different networks.
- Static routing is suitable for small networks or when specific paths need to be enforced, but it is not scalable for large networks.

6. Dynamic Routing:

- Dynamic routing protocols automate the process of populating and updating routing tables.
- Routers using dynamic routing protocols exchange information about networks, update their routing tables accordingly, and adapt to network changes.
- Dynamic routing protocols enable routers to dynamically discover new networks, handle network failures, and optimize routing paths.

7. Routing Metrics:

- Routing metrics are values used to determine the best path to a destination network.
- Metrics can be based on factors like hop count, bandwidth, delay, load, or path cost.
- Different routing protocols may use different metrics to make routing decisions.

8. Routing Protocols and Convergence:

- Convergence is the process by which routers in a network reach a consistent view of the network topology and its best paths.
- Routing protocols employ various mechanisms to achieve convergence, including periodic updates, triggered updates upon network changes, and route recomputation.
