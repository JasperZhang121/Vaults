1. IP Address Basics:

- An IP address (Internet Protocol address) is <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">a unique numerical label assigned</mark> to each device connected to a computer network.
- IP addresses facilitate the identification and location of devices in an IP-based network.
- IP addresses are used in both IPv4 and IPv6 addressing schemes.

2. IPv4 Addressing:

- IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) is the most widely used IP addressing scheme.
- An IPv4 address consists of 32 bits, represented as four sets of numbers separated by periods (e.g., 192.168.0.1).
- Each set, also known as an octet, represents a value ranging from 0 to 255.
- IPv4 allows for approximately 4.3 billion unique addresses, which are becoming scarce due to the growth of the internet.

3. IPv6 Addressing:

- IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6) is the next-generation IP addressing scheme designed to replace IPv4.
- IPv6 addresses are 128 bits long, represented as eight groups of hexadecimal digits separated by colons (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).
- IPv6 provides an enormous address space, allowing for approximately 3.4 x 10^38 unique addresses.
- The increased address space in IPv6 addresses the shortage of available addresses in IPv4.

4. IP Address Classes (IPv4):

- IPv4 addresses are classified into five classes: A, B, C, D, and E.
- Classes A, B, and C are used for host addressing, while classes D and E are reserved for multicast and experimental purposes, respectively.
- The class of an IPv4 address is determined by the range of values in the first octet (the first 8 bits).
- Class A addresses have a range of 1.0.0.0 to 126.0.0.0 and are primarily used by large networks.
- Class B addresses have a range of 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.0.0 and are typically used by medium-sized networks.
- Class C addresses have a range of 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.0 and are commonly assigned to small networks.

5. Private and Public IP Addresses:

- Private IP addresses are reserved for internal use within a private network and are not routable on the public internet.
- IPv4 private address ranges are as follows:
    - Class A: 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255
    - Class B: 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255
    - Class C: 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255
- Public IP addresses are globally unique and can be routed on the public internet.
- Public IP addresses are assigned to devices that need to communicate with the internet.

6. Subnetting and Subnet Masks:

- Subnetting is the process of <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">dividing a network into smaller subnetworks or subnets</mark>.
- Subnet masks are used to determine the network and host portions of an IP address.
- A subnet mask is a 32-bit value consisting of ones (1s) in the network portion and zeros (0s) in the host portion.
- Subnetting allows for efficient utilization of IP addresses and enables network segmentation.

7. CIDR Notation:

- CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation is used to represent IP addresses and subnet masks in a concise format.
- CIDR notation combines the IP address and the number of network bits, separated by a forward slash (e.g., 192.168.0.0/24).
- The number after the slash represents the number of network bits, which indicates the size of the network.
