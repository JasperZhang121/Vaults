1. NAT Basics:

- Network Address Translation (NAT) is a technique used to translate IP addresses between different networks.
- NAT <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">allows devices within a private network to communicate with devices on the public internet</mark> using a single or a few public IP addresses.

2. NAT Types:

- Static NAT: Also known as one-to-one NAT, <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">static NAT maps a private IP address to a specific public IP address permanently</mark>. It is commonly used when a device in the private network needs to be accessible from the internet.
- Dynamic NAT: Dynamic <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">NAT maps multiple private IP addresses to a pool of public IP addresses from a pre-defined range</mark>. The mapping is dynamically allocated and released as needed. It allows multiple devices to share a limited number of public IP addresses.
- Port Address Translation (PAT): Also known as NAT Overload, PAT is a type of dynamic NAT where private IP addresses are mapped to a single public IP address. Differentiating factor is the use of unique port numbers to track connections. It allows many devices to share a single public IP address by using different port numbers.

3. NAT Operation:

- Outgoing NAT: When a device in the private network initiates a connection to a device on the internet, NAT modifies the source IP address of the packet to the public IP address assigned by the NAT device.
- Incoming NAT: When a packet from the internet is destined for a device in the private network, NAT modifies the destination IP address to the corresponding private IP address and forwards the packet to the appropriate device.

4. Benefits of NAT:

- Address Conservation: NAT allows a private network to use private IP addresses, which are non-routable on the internet, conserving the limited pool of public IP addresses.
- Security Enhancement: NAT acts as a firewall by <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">hiding the internal IP addresses from external networks, providing an additional layer of security</mark>.
- IP Version Transition: NAT helps facilitate the transition from IPv4 to IPv6 by allowing devices on an IPv6 network to access IPv4 resources and vice versa.

5. Limitations of NAT:

- End-to-End Connectivity: NAT introduces a limitation on direct end-to-end connectivity between devices on different networks, as the private IP addresses are not routable on the internet.
- Certain Protocols: Some protocols that embed IP addresses in the application layer may encounter issues when traversing NAT. Protocols like FTP, SIP, and IPSec may require additional configurations or support for NAT traversal techniques.
- IPsec and VPNs: NAT can interfere with IPsec and VPN (Virtual Private Network) implementations that rely on IP addresses for authentication or encryption.

6. NAT Variants:

- Carrier-grade NAT (CGNAT): CGNAT is used by internet service providers (ISPs) to share a limited number of public IP addresses among multiple customers, especially in scenarios where IPv4 addresses are scarce.
- NAT64: NAT64 is used to facilitate communication between IPv6-only and IPv4-only networks. It allows IPv6 devices to access IPv4 resources by translating IPv6 packets to IPv4 packets and vice versa.
