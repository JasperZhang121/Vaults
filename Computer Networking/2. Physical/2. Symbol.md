In digital communication, symbols with the same time interval are often used to represent a binary number, and the signal within such a time interval is called a (binary) symbol. And this interval is called the symbol length. It should be noted that when there are more than 2 discrete states of the code element (for example, M is greater than 2), the code element is an M-ary code element.
Symbol, the basic signal unit that carries information.

Symbol transmission rate, also known as symbol rate or code transmission rate. It is defined as the number of symbols transmitted per second, and the unit is "baud", which can also be called the baud rate. It is usually represented by the symbol "Baud", and it is abbreviated as "B".
