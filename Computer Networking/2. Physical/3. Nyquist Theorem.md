The Nyquist theorem is also known as the sampling theorem. It is the principle to accurately reproduce a pure sine wave measurement, or [sample](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/sample), rate, which must be at least twice its [frequency](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/frequency). The Nyquist theorem underpins all [analog-to-digital conversion](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/analog-to-digital-conversion-ADC) and is used in digital audio and video to reduce [aliasing](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/aliasing).

Factors Affecting the Degree of Distortion:
- symbol transfer rate
- Signal transmission distance
- noise interference
- Transmission Media Quality

A Phenomenon of Distortion-Intersymbol Interference
- Signal bandwidth: the difference between the highest frequency and the lowest frequency that the channel can pass
- Intersymbol Interference: The signal waveform received by the receiving end loses the clear boundary between symbols. (too high frequency)

Nyquist criterion (Nyquist theorem): Under ideal low-pass (noise-free, bandwidth-limited) conditions, in order to avoid intersymbol interference, the limit symbol transmission rate is 2W Baud, W is the channel bandwidth, and the unit is Hz.
