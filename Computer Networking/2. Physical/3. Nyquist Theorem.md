### Nyquist Theorem:

The Nyquist theorem, also known as the sampling theorem, is a principle in digital signal processing that ensures accurate reproduction of a pure sine wave measurement or sample. According to the Nyquist theorem, the sample rate must be at least twice the frequency of the signal being measured. This principle is used in analog-to-digital conversion and is important in digital audio and video to reduce aliasing.

### Factors Affecting Degree of Distortion:

Several factors can affect the degree of distortion in a signal, including the symbol transfer rate, signal transmission distance, noise interference, and transmission media quality.

### Intersymbol Interference:

Intersymbol interference is a phenomenon of distortion that occurs when the signal waveform received by the receiving end loses the clear boundary between symbols. The signal bandwidth, which is the difference between the highest and lowest frequency that the channel can pass, can also affect the occurrence of intersymbol interference.

### Nyquist Criterion:

The Nyquist criterion is used to avoid intersymbol interference under ideal low-pass conditions. According to the Nyquist criterion, the limit symbol transmission rate is 2W Baud, where W is the channel bandwidth measured in Hz. This criterion ensures that the signal is accurately represented and minimizes distortion in the transmission.

In summary, the Nyquist theorem is a principle in digital signal processing that ensures accurate reproduction of a pure sine wave measurement or sample. Several factors can affect the degree of distortion in a signal, and intersymbol interference is a phenomenon of distortion that occurs when the signal waveform loses the clear boundary between symbols. The Nyquist criterion is used to avoid intersymbol interference and ensure accurate representation of the signal in transmission.
