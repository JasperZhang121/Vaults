A mechanism used in data communication to manage <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">the rate of data transmission between a sender and receiver</mark>. It ensures that the sender does not overwhelm the receiver with data by regulating the flow of data based on the receiver's ability to process and handle it. Flow control ensures smooth and efficient data transmission by maintaining a balance between the sender's data rate and the receiver's processing capability. It plays a crucial role in maintaining reliable communication and optimizing network performance.

1. Preventing Data Loss and Overload: Flow control <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">prevents data loss and overload situations</mark> by ensuring that the receiver can handle the incoming data at a rate it can manage. It prevents the receiver's buffer from becoming overwhelmed with data, which could lead to dropped packets or degraded performance.
    
2. Sender-Receiver Coordination: Flow control requires coordination between the sender and receiver. <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">The receiver provides feedback to the sender indicating its readiness to receive more data or signaling that it needs the sender to slow down the transmission rate</mark>.
    
3. Buffer Management: Flow control typically involves the use of buffers at the receiver's end. The receiver maintains a buffer to <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">temporarily store incoming data until it can be processed</mark>. Flow control mechanisms monitor the fill level of the buffer and adjust the transmission rate accordingly.
    
4. Flow Control Techniques: There are various flow control techniques employed in different communication protocols. Some common techniques include:
    
    - Stop-and-Wait: The sender sends a data frame and <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">waits for an acknowledgment from the receiver before sending the next frame</mark>.
        
    - Sliding Window: The sender is allowed to transmit multiple frames before receiving acknowledgments. The receiver maintains a window indicating the <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">maximum number of unacknowledged frames</mark> it can handle.
        
    - Credit-Based Flow Control: The receiver grants the sender a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">credit indicating the number of data units</mark> it can accept, allowing the sender to transmit up to that credit limit.
        
5. Congestion Avoidance: Flow control also helps in <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">avoiding network congestion</mark>. By regulating the flow of data, it prevents the network from becoming overloaded with more traffic than it can handle, leading to improved overall performance and reduced packet loss.  

### Sliding Window
<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">GBN (Go-Back-N) and SR (Selective Repeat)</mark> are two variations of the sliding window protocol used for reliable data transmission in computer networks. Both protocols provide flow control and error recovery mechanisms. Here's an overview of each protocol:

1. Go-Back-N (GBN):

- GBN is a sliding window protocol where the sender can transmit multiple frames before receiving acknowledgments.
- The sender maintains a sending window that allows it to send a specified number of frames (window size) without waiting for individual acknowledgments.
- The receiver sends cumulative acknowledgments, indicating the highest consecutive frame it has received correctly.
- If the sender receives an acknowledgment for frame "<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">N," it knows that all frames before "N" have been received successfully</mark>. It can then slide the window and send the next set of frames.
- If the sender does <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">not receive an acknowledgment within a specified timeout period or if it receives a negative acknowledgment (NAK)</mark>, it assumes that one or more frames have been lost. In such cases, it <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">retransmits all unacknowledged frames starting from the oldest unacknowledged frame</mark> (goes back to the beginning of the window).

2. Selective Repeat (SR):

- SR is another sliding window protocol where the sender can transmit multiple frames before receiving acknowledgments.
- Similar to GBN, the sender maintains a sending window and the receiver sends cumulative acknowledgments.
- However, unlike GBN, the receiver in <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">SR individually acknowledges each correctly received frame</mark>, rather than just the highest consecutive frame.
- If the sender receives a negative acknowledgment (NAK) or does not receive an acknowledgment within the timeout period for a specific frame, <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">it only retransmits that particular frame</mark>.
- The receiver buffers out-of-order frames until missing frames are received, allowing for reordering and correct reconstruction of the data at the receiver's end.
