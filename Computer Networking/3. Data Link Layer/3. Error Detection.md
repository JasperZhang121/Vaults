### Parity check 
a simple and commonly used error detection technique in data communication. It involves <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">adding an extra bit, known as a parity bit, to a data unit (such as a byte) being transmitted</mark>.

There are two types of parity checks:

1. Even Parity: In even parity, <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">the number of 1 bits in the data unit, including the parity bit, is always made even</mark>. The value of the parity bit is set to make the total number of 1 bits in the data unit (including the parity bit) an even count.
    
2. Odd Parity: In odd parity, the number of 1 bits in the data unit, including the parity bit, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">is always made odd</mark>. The value of the parity bit is set to make the total number of 1 bits in the data unit (including the parity bit) an odd count.  

During transmission, the sender calculates the parity bit based on the data being sent and adds it to the data unit. The receiver then performs a parity check by recalculating the parity bit based on the received data. <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">If the recalculated parity bit does not match the received parity bit, an error is detected</mark>.

### Cyclic Redundancy Check  
an error detection technique commonly used in data communication. It is a <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">more robust and reliable</mark> method compared to simple parity checks. CRC involves performing polynomial division on the data being transmitted, generating a checksum based on the remainder of the division. This checksum, also known as the CRC value, is appended to the original data before transmission.

Steps:
1. Polynomial Selection: A specific polynomial is chosen as the divisor for the CRC calculation. The selection of the polynomial depends on factors such as desired error detection capabilities and the characteristics of the communication channel.
    
2. Data Encoding: The data to be transmitted is treated as a polynomial. This polynomial is divided by the chosen CRC polynomial, using binary division with no carry operations. The remainder obtained from this division becomes the CRC value.
    
3. Checksum Appending: The CRC value is appended to the original data, creating the transmitted data unit. The receiver will perform the same CRC calculation on the received data to obtain its CRC value.
    
4. Error Detection: The receiver performs the same polynomial division using the received data and the chosen CRC polynomial. If the remainder is zero, it indicates that no errors were detected. If the remainder is non-zero, it signifies the presence of errors in the received data.
    

CRC offers <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">a high level of error detection capabilities and can detect a wide range of errors, including both single-bit and multiple-bit errors.</mark> It is widely used in various protocols and applications, such as Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and storage devices, to ensure data integrity during transmission. However, CRC alone does not provide error correction capabilities, focusing solely on error detection.

### Hamming codes
are a class of error correction codes named after Richard Hamming. They are widely used for error detection and correction in data communication and storage systems.

The main feature of Hamming codes is their ability to detect and correct single-bit errors. They achieve this by adding redundant bits to the original data, allowing the receiver to identify and correct errors.

1. Single-Error Correction: Hamming codes can detect and correct single-bit errors. They achieve this by <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">adding parity bits to the data in a specific way</mark>. The number and position of the added parity bits depend on the size of the data being transmitted.
    
2. Parity Bit Calculation: The added parity bits are calculated based on specific rules. Each parity bit checks a specific combination of data bits, allowing the receiver to identify the bit that has been flipped during transmission.
    
3. Error Detection: If an error occurs during transmission, the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">receiver's calculations will reveal a mismatch between the received data and the calculated parity bits.</mark> This mismatch indicates the presence of an error.
    
4. Error Correction: Based on the positions of the parity bits where errors are detected, the receiver can determine the bit that has been flipped and correct it.
    
5. Efficiency: Hamming codes achieve error correction with a relatively small amount of redundant bits. They strike a balance between error detection and correction capabilities and the overhead of adding extra bits to the transmitted data.
