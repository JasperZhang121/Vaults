### Symbols in Digital Communication:

In digital communication, symbols are used to represent binary numbers, and the signal within a time interval is called a binary symbol. The time interval is called the symbol length. If there are more than two discrete states of the code element (for example, M is greater than 2), the code element is called an M-ary code element. The symbol is the basic signal unit that carries information.

### Symbol Transmission Rate:

The symbol transmission rate, also known as the <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">symbol rate or code transmission rate</mark>, is defined as the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">number of symbols transmitted per second</mark>. The unit of symbol transmission rate is "baud", which can also be called the baud rate. The symbol "Baud" is used to represent the symbol transmission rate, and it is abbreviated as "B".

The symbol transmission rate is an important parameter in digital communication, as it determines the maximum data rate that can be transmitted over a given channel. The higher the symbol transmission rate, the higher the data rate that can be achieved.

In summary, symbols are used to represent binary numbers in digital communication, and the symbol transmission rate is the number of symbols transmitted per second. The symbol transmission rate determines the maximum data rate that can be transmitted over a given channel.
