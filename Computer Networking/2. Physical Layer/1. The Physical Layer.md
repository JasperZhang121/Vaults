The Physical Layer is the first layer of the OSI model and is responsible for the physical means of connecting computers together. It specifies some electrical characteristics of the network and is responsible for transmitting electrical signals of 0 and 1.

Various transmission media can be used at this layer, including optical cables, cables, twisted pair wires, radio waves, and others. These media are used to transmit the electrical signals that represent data between devices in the network.

### Types of Communication:

Different types of communication can occur over the physical layer, including:

-   **Simplex Communication:** In simplex communication, <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">data can only flow in one direction, from the sender to the receiver</mark>. The receiver cannot send any data back to the sender.
    
-   **Half-duplex Communication:** In half-duplex communication, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">data can flow in both directions, but not at the same time</mark>. Each device can only transmit or receive data at any given time.
    
-   **Full duplex Communication:** In full duplex communication, <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">data can flow in both directions simultaneously</mark>. Each device can transmit and receive data at the same time.
