**A design and performance characteristic of a telecommunications network**. It specifies the latency for a bit of data to travel across the network from one communication endpoint to another. It is typically measured in multiples or fractions of a second.

-   [Processing delay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processing_delay "Processing delay") – time it takes a router to process the packet header
-   [Queuing delay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queuing_delay "Queuing delay") – time the packet spends in routing queues
-   [Transmission delay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_delay "Transmission delay") – time it takes to push the packet's bits onto the link    
-   [Propagation delay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propagation_delay "Propagation delay") – time for a signal to propagate through the media

Calculations:

Transmission delay: L/R
(L is the length of the packet and R is the transimission rate)

Propagation delay: D/S
(D is the distance between sender and receiver over a link, and S is the transmission speed)
