1. DNS Basics:

- The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical and distributed <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">naming system used to map human-readable domain names</mark> (e.g., example.com) to IP addresses (e.g., 192.0.2.1).
- DNS plays a crucial role in the internet, translating domain names into the numerical IP addresses required for devices to communicate.

2. DNS Resolution Process:

- When a user enters a domain name in a web browser or application, the DNS resolution process begins.
- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">The client's operating system first checks its local cache for the corresponding IP address. If the domain is not cached, the resolution process proceeds to the next step</mark>.

3. Recursive and Iterative Queries:

- The client's DNS resolver sends a recursive query to a DNS server, typically provided by the Internet Service Provider (ISP) or a public DNS resolver like Google's 8.8.8.8.
- The DNS resolver contacts authoritative DNS servers to obtain the IP address for the requested domain through iterative queries, following the DNS hierarchy.

4. DNS Hierarchy:

- DNS operates in a hierarchical manner, with different levels of authority for domain names.
- At the top of the hierarchy are the root servers, which know the IP addresses of the Top-Level Domain (TLD) servers (e.g., .com, .org, .net).
- TLD servers know the IP addresses of authoritative name servers for specific domains (e.g., example.com).

5. DNS Record Types:

- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">DNS stores various types of resource records (RRs) associated with a domain</mark>. Common record types include:
    - A (Address) records: Map domain names to IPv4 addresses.
    - AAAA (IPv6 Address) records: Map domain names to IPv6 addresses.
    - CNAME (Canonical Name) records: Alias one domain name to another.
    - MX (Mail Exchange) records: Identify mail servers responsible for receiving emails for the domain.
    - NS (Name Server) records: Identify the authoritative name servers for the domain.

6. DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions):

- DNSSEC is a suite of extensions to DNS that adds an additional layer of security by providing authentication and data integrity for DNS responses.
- It prevents DNS cache poisoning and ensures that clients receive valid and unaltered DNS information.

7. DNS Caching:

- To reduce DNS resolution time and network traffic, DNS resolvers and web browsers cache DNS responses.
- DNS caching helps speed up subsequent requests for the same domain and reduces the load on DNS servers.

8. Dynamic DNS (DDNS):

- Dynamic DNS allows the automatic update of DNS records when the IP address of a device changes, allowing devices with dynamic IP addresses to be accessible via a domain name.
