1. SMTP Basics:

- SMTP is the <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">standard protocol used for sending and transferring email messages between email clients (mail user agents) and mail servers (mail transfer agents)</mark>.
- It operates on a client-server model, where the client (sender) initiates a connection to the server (receiver) to send an email message.

2. SMTP Components:

- SMTP uses two main components: <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Mail User Agent (MUA) and Mail Transfer Agent (MTA)</mark>.
- The Mail User Agent is the email client used by the end-user to compose, send, and receive email messages.
- The Mail Transfer Agent is responsible for relaying email messages between mail servers.

3. SMTP Process:

- When an email is sent, the Mail User Agent (MUA) communicates with the outgoing Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) on the sender's email server.
- The MTA on the sender's server transfers the email message to the recipient's email server using the recipient's email address and the destination server's DNS MX (Mail Exchange) records.
- The recipient's MTA delivers the email message to the recipient's mailbox, where it can be retrieved by the recipient's Mail User Agent (MUA).

4. SMTP Commands:

- SMTP uses a set of commands to communicate between the client and the server during the email transfer process.
- Common SMTP commands include EHLO/HELO (greeting), MAIL FROM (specify sender's email address), RCPT TO (specify recipient's email address), DATA (start email message data), and QUIT (end the session).

5. Email Protocols:

- SMTP is used in conjunction with other email protocols for sending and receiving emails.
- POP3 (Post Office Protocol version 3): Allows email clients to retrieve emails from the server and download them to the client's device. By default, POP3 removes the email from the server after download.
- IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol): Similar to POP3, IMAP also allows email clients to retrieve emails from the server. However, IMAP retains the emails on the server, allowing users to manage and access their emails from multiple devices.

6. MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions):

- MIME is an extension to SMTP that allows emails to include various content types, such as attachments, images, and multimedia, in addition to plain text.
- MIME ensures that email clients can correctly interpret and display email content.

7. Secure Email Protocols:

- For secure email communication, SMTP can be combined with SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security) to encrypt email data during transmission.
- Secure email protocols, like SMTPS and STARTTLS, ensure that email communication remains confidential and protected from interception.
