1. HTTP Basics:

- HTTP is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web.
- It is an application layer protocol that enables clients (such as web browsers) to request resources from web servers and receive responses containing the requested data.

2. Client-Server Model:

- HTTP <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">operates on a client-server model</mark>, where clients initiate requests for resources, and servers respond to those requests.
- The client (usually a web browser) sends an HTTP request to the server, which processes the request and sends back an HTTP response containing the requested data.

3. HTTP Methods:

- HTTP defines various methods that indicate the desired action to be performed on a resource. Common methods include:
    - GET: Retrieve data from the server.
    - POST: Send data to the server to create or update a resource.
    - PUT: Send data to the server to update or create a specific resource.
    - DELETE: Request the server to remove a specified resource.

4. Request and Response Structure:

- HTTP requests consist of a request line, headers, and an optional message body. The request line contains the method, URL, and HTTP version.
- HTTP responses consist of a status line, headers, and an optional message body. The status line includes the HTTP version, status code, and a status message.

5. URL (Uniform Resource Locator):

- URLs are used in HTTP requests to specify the location of the desired resource on the server.
- A URL consists of several components, including the protocol (e.g., http:// or https://), the domain name or IP address of the server, the port number (optional), and the resource path.

6. Status Codes:

- HTTP responses include <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">a three-digit status code that indicates the result of the request</mark>. Common status codes include:
    - 200 OK: The request was successful.
    - 404 Not Found: The requested resource was not found on the server.
    - 500 Internal Server Error: The server encountered an error while processing the request.

7. Statelessness:

- HTTP is a stateless protocol, meaning <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">each request and response is independent and does not retain any information about previous interactions</mark>.
- To maintain state between client and server, web applications often use cookies or other session management techniques.

8. HTTPS (HTTP Secure):

- HTTPS is a secure version of HTTP that uses TLS (Transport Layer Security) to encrypt data exchanged between the client and the server.
- HTTPS is essential for securing sensitive data, such as login credentials and personal information, during transmission.

9. HTTP/2 and HTTP/3:

- HTTP/2 is a major revision of the HTTP protocol, introducing features like multiplexing, server push, and header compression to improve performance.
- HTTP/3 is the latest version of HTTP, designed to improve performance over unreliable networks by using the QUIC transport protocol.
