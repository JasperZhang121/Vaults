The TCP/IP Model has four layers, namely:

-   **Application Layer:**
    -   The application layer specifies the protocol that allows users to communicate with the network. FTP, HTTP are some such protocols.
-   **Transport Layer:**
    -   The Transport Layer describes how data should move between hosts.
    -   The Transmission Control Protocol is the most important protocol at this layer (TCP).
    -   This layer guarantees that data transferred between hosts is in the correct sequence and is in charge of end-to-end delivery.
-   **Internet Layer:**
    -   The Internet Protocol (IP) operates on this layer.
    -   This layer makes host addressing and identification easier.
    -   This layer is responsible for routing.
-   **Network Interface Layer:**
    -   This layer offers the means for delivering and receiving real data.
    -   This layer, unlike its OSI Model equivalent, is independent of the underlying network architecture and hardware.
