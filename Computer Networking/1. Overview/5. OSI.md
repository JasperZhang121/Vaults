![[OSI-Model.webp]]

The OSI Model has seven layers, namely:

-   **Application Layer:**
    -   The application layer is in charge of providing an interface to the application user. This layer contains protocols that communicate directly with the user.
-   **Presentation Layer:**
    -   This layer deals with the appearance and format of the data on the end devices.
-   **Session Layer:**
    -   This layer is responsible for maintaining connections between remote hosts.
    -   For example, after user/password authentication is complete, the remote host retains the session and does not request authentication again within that time period.
-   **Transport Layer:**
    -   The Transport Layer is in charge of end-to-end delivery between hosts.
-   **Network Layer:**
    -   This layer is in charge of assigning addresses and uniquely addressing hosts in a network.
-   **Data Link Layer:**
    -   The Data Link Layer is in charge of reading and writing data from and onto the line. At this layer, link problems are identified.
-   **Physical Layer:**
    -   This layer tells us about the hardware, cabling wiring, power output, pulse rate, and so on.
