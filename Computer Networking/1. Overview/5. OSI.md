#### Application Layer

**Function:** Provides an interface to the application user and contains protocols that <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">communicate directly with the user</mark>. It is responsible for <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">user authentication and user data formatting</mark>.

**Example Protocols:**
- **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):** Used for transferring web pages on the internet.
- **HTTPS (HTTP Secure):** Secure version of HTTP, using encryption for secure web browsing.
- **FTP (File Transfer Protocol):** Used for transferring files between computers on a network.
- **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol):** Used for sending emails.
- **POP3 (Post Office Protocol version 3) & IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol):** Used for retrieving emails from a server. POP3 downloads emails; IMAP allows emails to be read without downloading.
- **SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol):** Used for managing devices on IP networks.
- **Telnet:** Allows remote login to other computers over a network.
- **SSH (Secure Shell):** Provides secure access to a remote computer.

#### Presentation Layer

**Function:** Deals with the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">appearance and format of the data</mark> on the end devices. It is responsible for data compression, encryption, and formatting.

**Example Protocols:**
- **SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) & TLS (Transport Layer Security):** Protocols for <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">encrypting internet traffic and verifying server identity</mark>.
- **JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) & MPEG (Moving Picture Experts Group):** Standards for compressing and encoding images and videos, respectively.
- **ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange):** A character encoding standard for text data.

#### Session Layer

**Function:** Responsible for <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">maintaining connections between remote hosts</mark>. It establishes, maintains, and terminates sessions between applications running on different hosts.

**Example Protocols:**
- **NetBIOS (Network Basic Input/Output System):** Provides communication services for applications.
- **SMB (Server Message Block):** Network file sharing protocol.
- **RPC (Remote Procedure Call):** Allows a program to request a service from a program located on another computer in a network.
- **PPTP (Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol):** Used for implementing virtual private networks (VPNs).

#### Transport Layer

**Function:** Responsible for <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">end-to-end delivery of data between hosts</mark>. It provides reliable and ordered delivery of data and error recovery.

**Example Protocols:**
- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):** Provides <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of a stream of packets</mark> on the network.
- **UDP (User Datagram Protocol):** Offers a <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">direct way to send and receive datagrams but without guaranteeing delivery, ordering, or error checking</mark>.
- **SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol):** Designed for transporting telephony (VoIP) signals over the Internet.

#### Network Layer

**Function:** Responsible for <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">assigning addresses and uniquely addressing hosts</mark> in a network. It provides logical addressing and routing of data between hosts.

**Example Protocols:**
- **IP (Internet Protocol):** Responsible for addressing and routing packets of data so they can travel across networks and arrive at the correct destination.
- **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol):** Used for diagnostic and error messages between network devices.
- **IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol):** Used for managing multicast group memberships.
- **RIP (Routing Information Protocol), OSPF (Open Shortest Path First), BGP (Border Gateway Protocol):** Protocols for routing data across the internet and within networks.
- **IPsec (Internet Protocol Security):** A suite of protocols for securing Internet Protocol communications by authenticating and encrypting each IP packet of a communication session.

#### Data Link Layer

**Function:** Responsible for <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">reading and writing</mark> data from and onto the line. It is responsible for <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">error detection and correction, flow control, and media access control</mark>.

**Example Protocols:**
- **Ethernet:** A technology for networking that allows devices to communicate over a physical medium (wire, optical fiber).
- **PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol):** Used for establishing a direct connection between two network nodes.
- **Switched Multilayer Switching (MLS):** Technique used in high-speed networks.
- **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol):** Resolves IP addresses to MAC (hardware) addresses.
- **RARP (Reverse Address Resolution Protocol):** Resolves MAC addresses to IP addresses.

#### Physical Layer

**Function:** Deals with the physical components of the network such as cables, wiring, power output, and pulse rate. It is responsible for transmitting raw data bits over a physical medium.

**Example Protocols and Technologies:**
- **Ethernet (Physical Layer Implementation):** Used in LAN technology.
- **USB (Universal Serial Bus):** Interface for connecting peripherals to a computer.
- **Bluetooth:** Standard for short-range wireless connection between devices.
- **IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi):** Standard for wireless networking.
- **Fiber Optics:** Medium for transmitting data as light pulses along glass or plastic strands.
