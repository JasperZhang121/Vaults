### The OSI Model:

The OSI Model is a conceptual framework for organizing and understanding how computer networks operate. It consists of seven layers, each with a specific set of functions and responsibilities:

-   **Application Layer:** This layer provides an interface to the application user and contains protocols that communicate directly with the user. It is responsible for user authentication and user data formatting.
    
-   **Presentation Layer:** This layer deals with the appearance and format of the data on the end devices. It is responsible for data compression, encryption, and formatting.
    
-   **Session Layer:** This layer is responsible for maintaining connections between remote hosts. It establishes, maintains, and terminates sessions between applications running on different hosts.
    
-   **Transport Layer:** This layer is responsible for end-to-end delivery of data between hosts. It provides reliable and ordered delivery of data and error recovery.
    
-   **Network Layer:** This layer is responsible for assigning addresses and uniquely addressing hosts in a network. It provides logical addressing and routing of data between hosts.
    
-   **Data Link Layer:** This layer is responsible for reading and writing data from and onto the line. It is responsible for error detection and correction, flow control, and media access control.
    
-   **Physical Layer:** This layer deals with the physical components of the network such as cables, wiring, power output, and pulse rate. It is responsible for transmitting raw data bits over a physical medium.

### Protocols

Certainly! Here's an expanded view of the OSI layers table with explanations for each protocol mentioned, focusing on their primary uses:
