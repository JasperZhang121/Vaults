### Latency

**Definition:** Latency is a design and performance characteristic of a telecommunications network that specifies the <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">time it takes for a bit of data to travel across the network from one communication endpoint to another</mark>. Latency is typically measured in multiples or fractions of a second.

### Types of Latency

- **Processing delay:** The time it takes a <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">router</mark> to process the <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">packet header</mark>.
- **Queuing delay:** The time the packet spends in routing queues.
- **Transmission delay:** The time it takes to push the packet's bits onto the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">link</mark>.
- **Propagation delay:** The time for a signal to propagate through the media.

### Analogy

Imagine at a busy airport trying to send a package to a friend in another country. There are several stages the package must go through before it reaches its final destination:

- **Processing delay** is like the time it takes for the airport staff to read the shipping label on your package and determine which airplane it needs to go on.
- **Queuing delay** is like the time your package spends waiting in line behind other packages that arrived before it.
- **Transmission delay** is like the time it takes for the airplane to take off and fly to the destination country.
- **Propagation delay** is like the time it takes for your package to clear customs and make its way to your friend's doorstep.

### Calculations

- **Transmission delay:** 
$$\text{Transmission delay} = \frac{L}{R}$$
Where L is the length of the packet (in bits) and R is the transmission rate (in bits per second).

- **Propagation delay:** 
$$\text{Propagation delay} = \frac{D}{S}$$
Where D is the distance between the sender and receiver over a link (in meters), and S is the propagation speed (in meters per second).

### Bandwidth-Delay Product

**Definition:** The Bandwidth-Delay Product (BDP) is a measurement of <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">how many bits can fill up a network link</mark>. It gives the maximum amount of data that can be in transit in the network. This is important for understanding the capacity of a network path and the buffer requirements for maintaining full utilization of the link.

$$\text{BDP} = \text{Bandwidth} \times \text{RTT}$$
Where:
- **Bandwidth** is the capacity of the network link (in bits per second).
- **RTT** (Round-Trip Time) is the time it takes for a signal to travel from the sender to the receiver and back again (in seconds).

### Round-Trip Time (RTT)

**Definition:** Round-Trip Time (RTT) is the duration it takes for a network request to go <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">from a starting point to a destination and back again to the starting point</mark>. RTT is typically measured in milliseconds (ms). It is an important metric in determining the health of a connection on a local network or the larger internet, and is commonly utilized by network administrators to diagnose the speed and reliability of network connections.

$$\text{RTT} = \text{Processing delay} + \text{Queuing delay} + \text{Transmission delay} + \text{Propagation delay}$$
### Example Calculation

Let's say we have the following parameters:
- Packet length L = 1000 bits
- Transmission rate R = 100 Mbps
- Distance D  = 5000 km
- Propagation speed S = $2 \times 10^8$ meters/second

1. **Transmission delay:**
$$\text{Transmission delay} = \frac{L}{R} = \frac{1000 \, \text{bits}}{100 \times 10^6 \, \text{bits/second}} = 10^{-5} \, \text{seconds} = 10 \, \text{microseconds}$$

2. **Propagation delay:**
$$\text{Propagation delay} = \frac{D}{S} = \frac{5000 \times 10^3 \, \text{meters}}{2 \times 10^8 \, \text{meters/second}} = 0.025 \, \text{seconds} = 25 \, \text{milliseconds}$$
