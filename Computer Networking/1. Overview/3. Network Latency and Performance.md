**Latency:** A design and performance characteristic of a telecommunications network that specifies the time it takes for a bit of data to travel across the network from one communication endpoint to another. Latency is typically measured in multiples or fractions of a second.

**Types of Latency:**

-   Processing delay: The time it takes a router to process the packet header.
-   Queuing delay: The time the packet spends in routing queues.
-   Transmission delay: The time it takes to push the packet's bits onto the link.
-   Propagation delay: The time for a signal to propagate through the media.

Imagine you're at a busy airport trying to send a package to a friend in another country. There are several stages the package must go through before it reaches its final destination. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Processing delay</mark> is like the time it takes for the airport staff to read the shipping label on your package and determine which airplane it needs to go on. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Queuing delay</mark> is like the time your package spends waiting in line behind other packages that arrived before it. <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Transmission delay</mark> is like the time it takes for the airplane to take off and fly to the destination country. And finally, <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">propagation delay</mark> is like the time it takes for your package to clear customs and make its way to your friend's doorstep.

**Calculations:**

-   Transmission delay: L/R (L is the length of the packet and R is the transmission rate)
-   Propagation delay: D/S (D is the distance between sender and receiver over a link, and S is the transmission speed)

**Bandwidth-Delay Product:** A measurement of how many bits can fill up a network link. It gives the maximum amount of data that can be transmitted by the sender at a given time before waiting for acknowledgment. Thus it is the maximum amount of unacknowledged data.

**Round-Trip Time (RTT):** The duration in milliseconds (ms) it takes for a network request to go from a starting point to a destination and back again to the starting point. RTT is an important metric in determining the health of a connection on a local network or the larger internet, and is commonly utilized by network administrators to diagnose the speed and reliability of network connections.
