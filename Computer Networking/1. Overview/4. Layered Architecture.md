### Importance of Computer Network Layered Architecture

- The major goal of layered architecture is to <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">divide the network design into smaller, manageable parts</mark>, facilitating easier maintenance and scalability.
- Each lower layer of the network contributes its <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">services to the layer above it</mark>, resulting in a complete set of services for managing communications and running applications.
- Layered architecture provides modularity and explicit interfaces, allowing subsystems to interact with one another in a well-defined manner. This modularity simplifies the development and maintenance of complex network systems.
- The layered architecture ensures layer <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">independence</mark> by offering services from the lowest to the highest layer without specifying how the services are implemented. Consequently, any changes made to one layer have <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">no effect on the other layers</mark>.
- Although the number of layers, functions, and contents of each layer may differ from one network to another, the objective of each layer is to <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">offer services from a lower to a higher layer while hiding the details of how the services are performed from the layers above</mark>.

In summary, the layered architecture is an essential design pattern for computer networks that provides several benefits, such as modularity, scalability, and layer independence. By dividing the network into distinct layers, each with its own set of services and interfaces, network administrators can more easily manage complex systems and adapt to changing network requirements.

### Fundamental Components of Layered Architecture
#### Service

A service is a <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">collection of activities</mark> provided by a <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">layer to a higher layer</mark>. Each layer provides a set of services to the layer above it, which are used to facilitate communication and data transfer between devices in the network.

#### Protocol

A protocol is a <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">collection of rules</mark> that a layer employs to share data with a peer entity. These rules primarily address the contents and order of the messages used. Protocols define <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">how data is formatted, transmitted, and received between devices in the network</mark>.

#### Interface

An interface is the means through which a message is transmitted from <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">one layer to another</mark>. Each layer provides a well-defined interface that specifies the services it offers to the layer above it and the services it expects to receive from the layer below it.

In a layered architecture, each layer communicates with the corresponding layer on another device, and the rules employed in the interaction are referred to as a layer-n protocol. The combination of services, protocols, and interfaces at each layer of the network stack forms a complete set of tools for managing communications and running applications.

### Features of Layered Architecture

- In a layered architecture, data is not directly transmitted from one machine's layer n to another machine's layer n. Instead, <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">each layer transmits the data to the one directly below it until the lowest layer is reached</mark>.
- The physical channel through which real communication takes place is located beneath layer 1.
- Layered architecture splits unmanageable activities into smaller, more manageable tasks.
- Data is sent from the <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">upper layer to the bottom layer via an interfac</mark>e. A layered design provides a clear interface, ensuring that only the essential information is communicated across levels. This also allows for the easy replacement of one layer's implementation with another.

### Example of Layered Architecture: The OSI Model

To illustrate the concept of layered architecture, let's consider the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model, which is a seven-layer architecture designed to standardize network communication:

1. **Physical Layer:** Handles the transmission of raw data bits over a physical medium (e.g., cables, radio waves).
2. **Data Link Layer:** Ensures reliable transmission of data frames between two nodes connected by a physical layer.
3. **Network Layer:** Manages logical addressing and routing of data packets between nodes.
4. **Transport Layer:** Ensures reliable data transfer with error detection and correction.
5. **Session Layer:** Manages sessions or connections between applications.
6. **Presentation Layer:** Translates data between the application layer and the network (e.g., encryption, compression).
7. **Application Layer:** Provides network services directly to end-user applications (e.g., email, file transfer).

Each layer in the OSI model interacts with the layer directly above and below it, providing services and ensuring that data is transmitted correctly from the source to the destination.
