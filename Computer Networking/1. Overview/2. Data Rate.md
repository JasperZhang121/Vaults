### Units

- **b/s** (bits per second)
- **kb/s** (kilobits per second)
- **Mb/s** (megabits per second)
- **Gb/s** (gigabits per second)
- **Tb/s** (terabits per second)

Conversion factors:
- 1 kb/s = \(10^3\) b/s
- 1 Mb/s = \(10^6\) b/s
- 1 Gb/s = \(10^3\) Mb/s = \(10^6\) kb/s = \(10^9\) b/s

### Bandwidth

**Definition:** Bandwidth is a measure of the <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">data transfer rate</mark> or capacity of a given network, typically measured in <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">bits per second (bps)</mark>. The bandwidth of a network determines how much data can be transmitted over a given period of time. A network with a higher bandwidth can transmit more data than a network with a lower bandwidth.

Mathematically, if $B$ is the bandwidth in bits per second, and $t$ is the time in seconds, then the total data $D$ transmitted is:
$$D = B \times t$$
For example, if the bandwidth $B$ is 1 Gb/s and the time $t$ is 10 seconds, the total data transmitted $D$ would be:
$$D = 1 \, \text{Gb/s} \times 10 \, \text{s} = 10 \, \text{Gb}$$

### Link

**Definition:** A link is a <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">communication channel</mark> that connects two or more devices for the purpose of data transmission. A link can be:
- **Wired:** such as an Ethernet cable
- **Wireless:** such as a Wi-Fi or Bluetooth connection

### Throughput

**Definition:** Throughput is the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">amount of data successfully moved from one place to another in a given time period</mark>, typically measured in bits per second (bps).

**Factors affecting throughput:**
- **Network congestion:** More devices using the network can reduce throughput.
- **Latency:** Delay in data transmission can affect the throughput.
- **Packet loss:** Loss of data packets can reduce the effective throughput.

Mathematically, if $T$ is the throughput, $D$ is the total data successfully transmitted, and $t$ is the time, then:
$$T = \frac{D}{t}$$

For example, if 500 MB of data is transmitted successfully over a period of 200 seconds, the throughput \( T \) would be:
$$T = \frac{500 \, \text{MB}}{200 \, \text{s}}$$
To convert MB to bits, use $1 \, \text{MB} = 8 \times 10^6 \, \text{bits}$:
$$T = \frac{500 \times 8 \times 10^6 \, \text{bits}}{200 \, \text{s}} = 20 \times 10^6 \, \text{b/s} = 20 \, \text{Mb/s}$$

High throughput is desirable as it indicates that data is being transmitted quickly and efficiently through the network.

| Key Differences | Bandwidth | Throughput|
|------------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Capacity vs. Performance**| Bandwidth is about the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">potential capacity</mark> of the network link. | Throughput is about the <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">actual performance</mark> and how much data is successfully transferred.|
| **Theoretical vs. Real-World** | Bandwidth is a theoretical measure of the network's capability.| Throughput is a practical measure of how well the network performs in real conditions. |
| **Measurement** | Bandwidth remains constant for a given network link. | Throughput can vary based on network conditions and other factors. |
