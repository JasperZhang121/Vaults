### Introduction:

1. **Elements**: 
- Hardware
- Software
- Contracts

2. **How it works**:
- Edge part:  1. C/S  2. P2P
- Core part

3. **Functions composition**:
- Communication subnet (communicate) -> last three layers
- Resources Subnet (share resources/ handle data) - Above 3 layers

### Types of Comuter Network :

<br/>

1. #### Classified by coverage:
-   PAN (Personal Area Network)
-   LAN (Local Area Network)
-   MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)
-   WAN (Wide Area Network)

Coverage:  WAN (internaitonal) > MAN (city) > LAN (1km to 10 kms) >PAN

<br/>

2. #### Classified by users:
- public network
- private network (military etc.)

<br/>

3. #### Classified by network switching technology:
