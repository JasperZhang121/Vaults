Computer networking refers toÂ **interconnected computing devices that can exchange data and share resources with each other**. These networked devices use a system of rules, called communications protocols, to transmit information over physical or wireless technologies.

### Introduction to Networking:

1.  **Elements**:
    -   Hardware: <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">physical devices</mark> used to connect and transmit data between devices in a network, such as <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">routers, switches, and cables</mark>.
    -   Software: programs used to manage and control the hardware in a network, such as <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">network operating systems and network management software</mark>.
    -   Contracts: agreements between parties outlining the terms and conditions of network usage, such as service level agreements and network security policies.
    
1.  **How it works**:
    -   Edge part: the <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">outermost layer</mark> of the network, where end-user devices are connected. Two common edge architectures are:
        1.  Client/Server (C/S): a centralized architecture where a server provides resources and services to clients on the network.
        2.  Peer-to-Peer (P2P): a decentralized architecture where devices communicate directly with each other without a centralized server.
    -   Core part: the inner layer of the network, where the routing and switching of data occurs. The core part is responsible for ensuring that data is transmitted efficiently and reliably through the network.
    
1.  **Functions composition**:
    -   Communication Subnet: the lower layers of the network stack responsible for <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">transmitting data between devices in the network</mark>. This includes the physical layer, data link layer, and network layer.
    -   Resources Subnet: the upper layers of the network stack responsible for providing services and <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">sharing resources between devices in the network</mark>. This includes the transport layer, session layer, presentation layer, and application layer.

### Types of Computer Networks:

1.  Classified by Coverage:
    -   Personal Area Network (PAN): This type of network connects devices in a <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">small, localized area</mark> such as a person's home or office. Examples of devices that may be connected in a PAN include smartphones, laptops, and printers.
    -   Local Area Network (LAN): This type of network covers a small geographical area, such as <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">a single building or campus</mark>. LANs are commonly used in offices, schools, and homes to connect multiple devices to a central server or router. Ethernet cables, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth are common technologies used to create a LAN.
    -   Metropolitan Area Network (MAN): This type of network covers a larger geographical area than a LAN, typically spanning a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">city or town</mark>. MANs are often used to provide internet access to businesses and institutions across a city.
    -   Wide Area Network (WAN): This type of network covers a wide geographical area, often spanning <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">multiple cities or even countries</mark>. WANs are commonly used to connect multiple LANs and MANs over a large distance. Examples of WANs include the internet and global communication networks such as satellite and submarine communication cables.
    
    The coverage hierarchy from smallest to largest is: PAN < LAN (1 km to 10 km) < MAN (city) < WAN (international)
    
2.  Classified by Users:
    -   Public Network: A network that is accessible to the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">general public</mark>. Examples of public networks include the internet, Wi-Fi hotspots, and public telephone networks.
    -   Private Network: A network that is accessible only to <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">authorized users</mark>. Private networks may be used by corporations, government agencies, and military organizations to securely communicate sensitive information.
    
3.  Classified by Network Switching Technology:
    -   Circuit Switching: A technology that establishes a dedicated physical connection between two devices for the duration of a communication session. Circuit switching is commonly used for <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">voice communications, such as telephone calls</mark>.
    -   Packet Switching: A technology that breaks data into small packets and routes them independently through a network. Packet switching is commonly used for <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">data communications, such as internet traffic</mark>.
    -   Message Switching: A technology that stores entire messages in nodes throughout a network until they can be delivered to their destination. Message switching is less efficient than packet switching but is <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">useful for networks with low bandwidth</mark>.
    
4.  Classified by Topology:
    -   Bus: A network topology where <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">all devices are connected to a single cable or backbone</mark>. Data is transmitted along the cable and received by all devices on the network.
    -   Star: A network topology where all devices are connected to a central hub or switch. Data is transmitted between devices through the <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">central hub</mark>.
    -   Ring: A network topology where devices are connected in a <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">circular pattern</mark>. Data is transmitted around the ring from one device to the next.
    -   Mesh: A network topology where devices are connected to multiple other devices in a network. Mesh topologies are highly redundant and fault-tolerant.
