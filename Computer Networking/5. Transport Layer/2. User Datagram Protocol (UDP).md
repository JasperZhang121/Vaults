1. UDP Basics:

- UDP is one of the core transport layer protocols in the TCP/IP suite, alongside TCP.
- It provides a simple, connectionless, and unreliable data delivery service between applications running on devices within a network.
- Unlike TCP, UDP does not establish a connection before transmitting data, making it faster and suitable for applications where speed is more important than data reliability.

2. Connectionless and Unreliable:

- UDP is a connectionless protocol, which means it does not establish a reliable, bidirectional connection between the sender and receiver before data transmission.
- It is <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">considered unreliable because it does not guarantee data delivery, error recovery, or packet retransmission</mark>.

3. UDP Header:

- The <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">UDP header is minimal compared to the TCP header</mark>, with only four fields: source port number, destination port number, length, and checksum.
- The simplicity of the UDP header reduces overhead, making UDP faster for certain types of applications.

4. Usage Scenarios:

- Real-Time Applications: UDP is commonly used in real-time applications like VoIP (Voice over IP) and video streaming. These applications prioritize speed and lower latency over error recovery.
- DNS (Domain Name System): DNS queries and responses use UDP for quick resolution of domain names to IP addresses.
- DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol): UDP is used in DHCP to assign IP addresses to network devices when they join the network.

5. Application Layer Protocols Using UDP:

- Many application layer protocols prefer UDP for its lower overhead and speed, especially when data reliability is handled at the application level.
- Examples of application layer protocols using UDP include DNS (Domain Name System), DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol), SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol), and TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol).

6. Lack of Flow Control and Congestion Control:

- UDP does not have built-in flow control mechanisms, so there is no prevention of overwhelming the receiver with data.
- Additionally, UDP does not implement congestion control, meaning it does not respond to network congestion as TCP does.

7. Usage with Error Checking:

- Although UDP itself <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">does not provide error recovery</mark>, some applications using UDP may implement their error checking and recovery mechanisms.
- This allows applications to handle data reliability based on the specific requirements of the application.
