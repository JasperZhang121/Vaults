1. TLS Basics:

- Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">cryptographic protocol that ensures secure communication over a computer network</mark>.
- It evolved from its predecessor, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), and is used to provide privacy, data integrity, and authentication for data transmitted between applications.
- TLS operates at the transport layer of the OSI model, securing communication between the application layer and the transport layer (TCP or UDP).

2. Secure Communication:

- TLS provides secure communication by encrypting data between the sender and receiver. This encryption prevents unauthorized parties from intercepting and reading the transmitted data.
- The use of TLS ensures that sensitive information, such as passwords, credit card numbers, and personal data, remains confidential during transmission.

3. Handshake Protocol:

- The TLS handshake is a crucial process that occurs at the beginning of a TLS session to establish the secure connection between the client and server.
- During the handshake, the client and server negotiate the encryption algorithms and establish the session keys for encrypting and decrypting data.
- The handshake also includes authentication steps, where the server presents its digital certificate to the client, verifying its identity.

4. Digital Certificates and Public-Key Infrastructure (PKI):

- TLS relies on digital certificates to verify the authenticity of the server and, optionally, the client.
- Digital certificates are issued by trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs) and contain the server's public key, along with information about the entity the certificate belongs to.
- Public-Key Infrastructure (PKI) is the system that manages the issuance, distribution, and revocation of digital certificates.

5. Encryption Algorithms:

- TLS supports various encryption algorithms for securing data transmission. Commonly used encryption algorithms include AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman), and ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography).
- The choice of encryption algorithm depends on the TLS version and the negotiated cipher suites during the TLS handshake.

6. TLS Versions:

- TLS has several versions, including TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1, TLS 1.2, and TLS 1.3.
- It is essential to use the latest TLS version (TLS 1.3 at the time of writing) to ensure the highest level of security and to avoid known vulnerabilities in older versions.

7. Usage with Application Layer Protocols:

- TLS is commonly used with application layer protocols like HTTPS (secure web browsing), SMTP with STARTTLS (secure email transmission), and FTPS (secure file transfer).
- By using TLS with these protocols, sensitive data, such as login credentials and personal information, is protected during transmission.

8. Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS):

- TLS 1.3 introduced Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS), ensuring that even if a long-term private key is compromised in the future, past communications remain secure.
- PFS generates a unique session key for each session, and the long-term private keys are not used for encryption, enhancing security.
