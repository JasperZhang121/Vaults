1. Port Numbers Basics:

- Port numbers are used to identify specific processes or applications running on devices within a network.
- In the context of the transport layer (TCP and UDP), port numbers are used to enable communication between the transport layer and the application layer.

2. Well-Known Ports:

- Port numbers range from <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">0 to 65535</mark>.
- The first <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">1024 port numbers (0 to 1023) are reserved for well-known ports</mark>, which are standardized and used for specific services and applications.
- For example, port 80 is commonly used for HTTP (web browsing), port 22 for SSH (secure shell), and port 53 for DNS (Domain Name System).

3. Registered Ports:

- Port numbers from <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">1024 to 49151 are registered ports, which can be used by applications and services after registering them with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)</mark>.
- These ports are often used by proprietary or less commonly used applications.

4. Dynamic/Private Ports:

- Port numbers from <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">49152 to 65535 are dynamic or private ports</mark>, which are not officially registered and can be used by applications dynamically.
- These ports are typically used for temporary connections and client applications.

5. Multiplexing:

- Multiplexing is the process of <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">combining multiple data streams into a single connection or transmission path</mark>.
- In the context of the transport layer, multiplexing allows multiple applications to share the same network connection and use the same transport layer protocol (TCP or UDP).

6. Demultiplexing:

- Demultiplexing is the process of extracting individual data streams from incoming packets and delivering them to the appropriate application or process.
- Demultiplexing is achieved using the port numbers in the transport layer headers.

7. How Multiplexing and Demultiplexing Work:

- When an application wants to send data over the network, the transport layer (TCP or UDP) combines the data with the appropriate source and destination port numbers.
- At the receiving end, the transport layer examines the port number in the incoming packets and uses it to determine which application or process should receive the data.

8. Benefits of Port Numbers and Multiplexing:

- Efficient Resource Utilization: Multiplexing allows multiple applications to use a single network connection, reducing the need for separate connections for each application.
- Port-Based Communication: Port numbers enable communication between applications based on unique identifiers, ensuring data is sent to the intended recipient.
