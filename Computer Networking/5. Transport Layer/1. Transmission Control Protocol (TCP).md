1. TCP Basics:

- TCP is one of the core transport layer protocols in the TCP/IP suite.
- It provides reliable, connection-oriented data delivery between applications running on devices within a network.
- TCP is responsible for breaking data into packets, sequencing them, ensuring their reliable delivery, and reassembling them at the destination.

2. TCP Features and Functions:

- Connection-Oriented: TCP establishes a reliable connection between the sender and receiver before data transmission.
- <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">Three-Way Handshake</mark>: TCP uses a three-step process (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK) for connection establishment, ensuring both ends are ready to exchange data.
- Error Detection and Recovery: TCP uses checksums to detect data corruption and sequence numbers to identify lost or out-of-order packets. It requests retransmission of lost packets.
- Flow Control: TCP uses a sliding window mechanism to control the amount of data sent by the sender and acknowledged by the receiver, preventing data overflow and congestion.

3. TCP Header:

- The TCP header contains control information necessary for data delivery and error recovery.
- Important fields in the TCP header include source and destination port numbers, sequence number, acknowledgment number, window size, checksum, and flags (e.g., SYN, ACK, FIN).

4. Reliable Data Delivery:

- TCP ensures reliable data delivery by acknowledging received packets and requesting retransmission of any lost or damaged packets.
- The acknowledgment mechanism uses cumulative acknowledgment to acknowledge all packets up to a certain sequence number.
- TCP maintains timers to handle delayed acknowledgments and retransmit unacknowledged packets.

5. TCP Flow Control and Congestion Control:

- Flow Control: TCP prevents overwhelming the receiver by using a <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">sliding window mechanism</mark>. The receiver advertises its window size, limiting the amount of data the sender can send before receiving an acknowledgment.
- Congestion Control: TCP uses various algorithms to detect and react to network congestion. Slow Start, Congestion Avoidance, and Fast Recovery are some congestion control mechanisms used by TCP.

6. Connection Termination:

- TCP connections are terminated gracefully using a four-step process (FIN, ACK-FIN, ACK, FIN-ACK).
- The connection termination process ensures both ends agree to close the connection and that all remaining data is transmitted before the connection is closed.

7. TCP vs. UDP:

- TCP is a reliable, connection-oriented protocol, ensuring data delivery with error recovery and flow control.
- UDP, on the other hand, is a connectionless, unreliable protocol with lower overhead, making it faster but less suitable for critical applications.

8. Application Layer Protocols Using TCP:

- Many application layer protocols rely on TCP for reliable data delivery. Some examples include HTTP (web browsing), FTP (file transfer), SMTP (email), and SSH (secure shell).
