Given two strings `text1` and `text2`, return _the length of their longest **common subsequence**._ If there is no **common subsequence**, return `0`.

A **subsequence** of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

-   For example, `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"`.

A **common subsequence** of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

```python
class Solution:
    def longestCommonSubsequence(self, text1: str, text2: str) -> int:
        m,n = len(text1), len(text2)
        dp = [[0 for j in range(n+1)] for i in range(m+1)]
        
        for i in range(1,m+1):
            for j in range(1,n+1):
                if text1[i-1] == text2[j-1]:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]+1
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = max (dp[i-1][j] , dp[i][j-1])
        return dp[m][n]
```
