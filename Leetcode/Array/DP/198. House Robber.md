You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security systems connected and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money of each house, return _the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police**_.

```python
class Solution:
    def rob(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if nums==[]:return 0
        n = len(nums)
        dp = [0]*(n+1)
        dp[1] = nums[0]
        for i in range(1,n):
            dp[i+1] = max(dp[i],dp[i-1]+nums[i])
        return dp[n]
```
