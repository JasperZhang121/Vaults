There is a robot on an `m x n` grid. The robot is initially located at the **top-left corner** (i.e., `grid[0][0]`). The robot tries to move to the **bottom-right corner** (i.e., `grid[m - 1][n - 1]`). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

Given the two integers `m` and `n`, return _the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner_.

The test cases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to `2 * 109`.

```python
class Solution:
    def uniquePaths(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
        
        dp = [[0]*(n) for _ in range(m)]
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if  i == 0:
                    dp[i][j] = 1
                    continue
                if j == 0:
                    dp[i][j] = 1
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]
                
        return dp[m-1][n-1]
```
