The [Hamming distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance) between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given two integers `x` and `y`, return _the **Hamming distance** between them_.

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int hammingDistance(int x, int y) {
        
        int diff = x^y, ans = 0;
        while (diff){
            ans+=diff&1;
            diff>>=1;
        }
        return ans;          
    }
};
```
