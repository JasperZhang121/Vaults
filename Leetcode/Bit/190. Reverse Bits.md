Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.

**Note:**

-   Note that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, both input and output will be given as a signed integer type. They should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.
-   In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using [2's complement notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement). Therefore, in **Example 2** above, the input represents the signed integer `-3` and the output represents the signed integer `-1073741825`.

```python
class Solution:
    def reverseBits(self, n: int) -> int:
        ret, power = 0, 31
        while n:
            ret += (n & 1) << power
            n = n >> 1
            power -= 1
        return ret 
```
