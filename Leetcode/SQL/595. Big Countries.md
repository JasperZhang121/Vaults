Table: `World`
```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| name        | varchar |
| continent   | varchar |
| area        | int     |
| population  | int     |

name is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table gives information about the name of a country, the continent to which it belongs, its area, the population, and its GDP value.
```

A country is **big** if:

-   it has an area of at least three million (i.e., `3000000 km2`), or
-   it has a population of at least twenty-five million (i.e., `25000000`).

Write an SQL query to report the name, population, and area of the **big countries**.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The query result format is in the following example.


```mysql
select name, population, area from world

where area>=3000000 or population>=25000000
```
