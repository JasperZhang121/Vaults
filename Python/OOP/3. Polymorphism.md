```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        
    def make_sound(self):
        pass

class Dog(Animal):
    def make_sound(self):
        return "Woof!"
    
class Cat(Animal):
    def make_sound(self):
        return "Meow!"
    
class Cow(Animal):
    def make_sound(self):
        return "Moo!"
    
animals = [Dog("Rufus"), Cat("Whiskers"), Cow("Bessie")]

for animal in animals:
    print(f"{animal.name}: {animal.make_sound()}")
```

In this example, we define an abstract `Animal` class with a constructor and a method `make_sound()`. We then create three derived classes `Dog`, `Cat`, and `Cow` that inherit from `Animal` and implement their own versions of `make_sound()`. Finally, we create a list of `Animal` objects and iterate through them, calling the `make_sound()` method for each object. This demonstrates Polymorphism in action, as the same method call (`make_sound()`) produces different behavior depending on the type of object it is called on.
