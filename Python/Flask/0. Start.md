### 1.  Install Flask:

To get started with Flask, you'll need to install it first. You can do this using pip, the Python package manager:

```
pip install Flask
```

### 2.  Create a Flask app:

To create a new Flask app, create a new Python file and import the Flask class:

```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)
```

### 3.  Define a route:

A route maps a URL to a Python function that handles requests to that URL. To define a route, use the `@app.route()` decorator and specify the URL:

```python
@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, World!'
```

This creates a new route that maps the root URL (`/`) to a function called `hello_world()`. When the user visits the root URL, Flask will call the `hello_world()` function and return the string `Hello, World!`.


### 4.  Run the app:

To run the app, add the following code at the end of your Python file:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

This starts the Flask development server and sets the `debug` flag to `True`, which allows you to see debugging information in the browser if an error occurs.
