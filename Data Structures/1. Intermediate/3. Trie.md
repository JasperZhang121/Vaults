A trie (pronounced "try") is a tree-like data structure used to store a dynamic set or associative array. Each node in the trie represents a character or a sequence of characters.

```python
# Define a TrieNode class for the trie
class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = {}
        self.is_end_of_word = False

# Create a trie in Python
root = TrieNode()

# Inserting a word into the trie
word = 'hello'
current = root
for char in word:
    if char not in current.children:
        current.children[char] = TrieNode()
    current = current.children[char]
current.is_end_of_word = True

# Searching for a word in the trie
word = 'hell'
current = root
for char in word:
    if char not in current.children:
        print('Word not found')
        break
    current = current.children[char]
else:
    if current.is_end_of_word:
        print('Word found')
    else:
        print('Word not found')
```
