A heap is a complete binary tree where every parent node is either greater than or equal to (max heap) or less than or equal to (min heap) its children.

```python
# Create a heap in Python using the heapq module
import heapq

# Creating a max heap
heap = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
heapq._heapify_max(heap)

# Adding an element to the heap
heapq._heappush_max(heap, 11)

# Removing the maximum element from the heap
max_element = heapq._heappop_max(heap)
print(max_element)  # Output: 11
```
