A hash table is a data structure that stores key-value pairs. The key is hashed to an index in an array, and the value is stored at that index.

```python
# Create a hash table in Python using a dictionary
hash_table = {}

# Adding key-value pairs to the hash table
hash_table['apple'] = 1
hash_table['banana'] = 2
hash_table['orange'] = 3

# Accessing the value associated with a key in the hash table
print(hash_table['banana'])  # Output: 2

# Deleting a key-value pair from the hash table
del hash_table['orange']
```
