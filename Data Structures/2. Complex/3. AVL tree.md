An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree that ensures that the height difference between the left and right subtrees is at most 1. It is named after its inventors, Adelson-Velsky and Landis, and is used to maintain the efficiency of binary search tree operations such as search, insertion, and deletion. AVL trees are balanced using rotations that preserve the binary search tree property and maintain the height balance.
