A segment tree is a tree-based data structure that is used to perform efficient range queries and updates on an array. It divides the array into segments and stores the preprocessed information about each segment in a tree-like structure. This allows for fast queries on any arbitrary range of elements, as well as updates to single elements. Segment trees are commonly used in problems that involve range-sum or range-minimum queries.
