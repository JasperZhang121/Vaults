A segment tree is a tree-based data structure that is used to perform efficient range queries and updates on an array. It divides the array into segments and stores the preprocessed information about each segment in a tree-like structure. This allows for fast queries on any arbitrary range of elements, as well as updates to single elements. Segment trees are commonly used in problems that involve range-sum or range-minimum queries.

```
                 [0, 7]
                 /     \
            [0, 3]    [4, 7]
            /   \     /    \
         [0, 1] [2, 3] [4, 5] [6, 7]
         / \     / \    / \    /  \
       [0] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7]
```

In this example, each node in the tree represents a range of indices in the array, and the leaves represent individual elements. The root node represents the entire range [0, 7], and its children represent the ranges [0, 3] and [4, 7].

The children of each node represent the two halves of its range. For example, the left child of the root represents the range [0, 3], and its children represent the ranges [0, 1] and [2, 3].

Each node in the tree stores some information about the corresponding range of indices. In the case of a segment tree used for minimum range queries, each node stores the minimum value in its range.
