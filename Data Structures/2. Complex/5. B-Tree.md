A B-tree is a self-balancing tree data structure that is used to maintain large datasets on disk. It is designed to minimize the number of disk accesses required for common operations such as search, insert, and delete. The B-tree is characterized by its branching factor, which is the maximum number of children a node can have. B-trees have a complexity of O(log n) for search, insert, and delete operations.

B-tree with order 3:

```
                    [8, 16]
                    /     \
               [1, 3, 5]  [20, 22, 23]
               /   |   \         |    \
       [-3, -2] [2] [4, 6]  [18, 19] [25, 30]
```
