A B+ tree is a variant of the B-tree that is optimized for disk access. It has a similar structure to the B-tree, but with all the data stored in the leaf nodes. The internal nodes contain only keys and pointers to other nodes. The B+ tree is designed to minimize the number of disk accesses required to retrieve a range of values by using a linked list of leaf nodes. It has a complexity of O(log n) for search, insert, and delete operations.
