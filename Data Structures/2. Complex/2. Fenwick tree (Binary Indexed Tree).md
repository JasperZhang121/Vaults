A Fenwick tree, also known as a binary indexed tree (BIT), is a data structure that allows for efficient prefix-sum queries and updates on an array. It is based on the idea of representing the array as a tree where each node represents the sum of a range of elements in the array. The tree is constructed by taking the binary representation of each index and using it to find the parent and children of each node. Fenwick trees have a space complexity of O(n) and a time complexity of O(log n) for both queries and updates.
