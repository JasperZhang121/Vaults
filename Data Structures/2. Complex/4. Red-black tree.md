A red-black tree is another self-balancing binary search tree that maintains a balance between the height of the tree and the number of nodes. It achieves this by coloring the nodes red or black and applying rules that ensure that the tree is balanced. The red-black tree has a height of at most 2log(n+1), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. It is commonly used in applications such as the implementation of sets and maps.
