A graph is a collection of vertices or nodes and edges that connect them. It is used to represent complex relationships and interactions between different entities. Graphs can be directed or undirected and can have various properties, such as weights, distances, or capacities. They can be represented using various data structures, such as adjacency matrices, adjacency lists, or edge lists.
