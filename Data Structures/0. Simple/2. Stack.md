-   A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle.
-   Elements can only be inserted or removed from the top of the stack.
-   Stacks can be implemented using an array or a linked list.
-   Stacks are used in applications where elements need to be processed in a last-in-first-out order, such as in function calls or undo operations.

```python
# Create a stack in Python using a list
stack = []

# Push elements onto the stack
stack.append(1)
stack.append(2)
stack.append(3)

# Pop elements from the stack
print(stack.pop())  # Output: 3
print(stack.pop())  # Output: 2
print(stack.pop())  # Output: 1
```
