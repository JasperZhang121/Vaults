-   An array is a collection of elements of the same data type stored at contiguous memory locations.
-   Elements in an array can be accessed using an index.
-   Arrays have a fixed size which is determined at the time of declaration, and cannot be changed later.
-   Arrays can be used to store data in a compact and efficient manner.

```python
# Create an array in Python
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Accessing elements of the array using index
print(arr[0])  # Output: 1
print(arr[3])  # Output: 4

# Inserting an element at a specific index
arr.insert(2, 6)
print(arr)  # Output: [1, 2, 6, 3, 4, 5]

# Removing an element from the array
arr.remove(2)
print(arr)  # Output: [1, 6, 3, 4, 5]
```
