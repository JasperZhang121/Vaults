-   A set is a collection of distinct elements.
-   Elements in a set have no particular order.
-   Sets can be implemented using an array, a linked list, or a hash table.
-   Sets are used in applications where we need to keep track of unique elements, such as in checking for duplicates or implementing mathematical operations.

```python
# Create a set in Python
s = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

# Adding an element to the set
s.add(6)
print(s)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

# Removing an element from the set
s.remove(4)
print(s)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 5, 6}

# Union of two sets
s1 = {1, 2, 3}
s2 = {2, 3, 4}
s3 = s1.union(s2)
print(s3)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4}
