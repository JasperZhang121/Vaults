-   A linked list is a collection of elements, where each element stores a value and a reference to the next element in the list.
-   Elements in a linked list can be accessed sequentially using a pointer starting from the first element.
-   Linked lists can grow or shrink in size dynamically during runtime.
-   Inserting or deleting an element in a linked list is faster than in an array, but random access is slower.

```python
# Define a Node class
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None

# Create a linked list in Python
head = Node(1)
head.next = Node(2)
head.next.next = Node(3)
head.next.next.next = Node(4)
head.next.next.next.next = Node(5)

# Traversing a linked list
current = head
while current is not None:
    print(current.data)
    current = current.next

# Inserting a node at the end of the linked list
new_node = Node(6)
current = head
while current.next is not None:
    current = current.next
current.next = new_node
```
