-   A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle.
-   Elements can only be inserted at the rear and removed from the front of the queue.
-   Queues can be implemented using an array or a linked list.
-   Queues are used in applications where elements need to be processed in a first-in-first-out order, such as in printing tasks or CPU scheduling.
```python
# Create a queue in Python using a list
queue = []

# Enqueue elements into the queue
queue.append(1)
queue.append(2)
queue.append(3)

# Dequeue elements from the queue
print(queue.pop(0))  # Output: 1
print(queue.pop(0))  # Output: 2
print(queue.pop(0))  # Output: 3
```
