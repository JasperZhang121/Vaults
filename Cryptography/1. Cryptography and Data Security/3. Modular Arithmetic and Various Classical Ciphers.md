### Modulo Arithmetic

1. **Definition**: Modulo arithmetic involves operations where numbers reset to zero after reaching a specified value, the modulus. This operation is mathematically expressed as a mod n , where a is the integer and n is the modulus.

2. **Properties**: This system follows the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">commutative, associative, and distributive laws for both addition and multiplication</mark>. For instance, \( (a \mod n) + (b \mod n) = (a + b) \mod n \) and similarly for multiplication.

3. **Applications**: Essential in computer science for tasks such as cryptography, where it helps with key generation and encryption, random number generation for simulations, and hash functions for data integrity checks.

### Integer Ring

1. **Concept**: The set of all integers modulo \( n \) forms a ring, often denoted as $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$, which consists of the <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">integers from 0 to n-1</mark> under addition and multiplication modulo \( n \).

2. **Features**: Each element \( a \) in this ring has an additive inverse that makes $a + b \equiv 0 \mod n$. Multiplicative inverses exist only for elements that are coprime with \( n \), which is vital for certain cryptographic algorithms.

3. **Use in Cryptography**: This structure is fundamental in public-key cryptosystems like RSA, where operations are performed within an integer ring for encryption and decryption processes.

### Shift Cipher

1. **Description**: Known as the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Caesar cipher, this method shifts the letters of the plaintext by a fixed number of positions within the alphabet</mark>.

2. **Encryption Process**: For a given shift \( k \), a letter \( x \) in the plaintext is transformed into \( (x + k) \mod 26 \), where 26 represents the alphabet's length.

3. **Decryption Process**: To decrypt, the process is reversed using \( (x - k) \mod 26 \), allowing the original message to be recovered.

4. **Vulnerability**: This cipher is highly susceptible to frequency analysis due to its linear nature and the preservation of letter frequencies, making it easy to crack with basic cryptanalytic techniques.

### Affine Cipher

1. **Mechanism**: This cipher employs a combination of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">linear transformation and modular arithmetic</mark>. It maps each plaintext letter \( x \) to \( (ax + b) \mod 26 \), where \( a \) and \( b \) serve as the cryptographic keys.

2. **Key Restrictions**: To ensure that each letter can be uniquely mapped and reversed, \( a \) must be chosen such that it is coprime to 26, allowing for the existence of a multiplicative inverse in modular arithmetic.

3. **Decryption Formula**: The decryption involves applying the modular inverse of \( a \), denoted as $a^{-1}$, such that the plaintext \( x \) is recovered by $x = a^{-1}(y - b) \mod 26$ where \( y \) is the ciphertext.

4. **Security Aspects**: Although more complex and secure than the shift cipher, the Affine cipher is still vulnerable to statistical analysis and known-plaintext attacks, which can exploit the linear nature of its encryption process.
