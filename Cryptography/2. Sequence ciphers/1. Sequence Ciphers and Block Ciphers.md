### Sequence Ciphers (Stream Ciphers)

1. **Definition**: Stream ciphers <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">encrypt plaintext one bit or byte at a time</mark>, often combining plain text bits with a pseudo-random cipher bit stream (keystream).

2. **Operation Mode**: Typically operates with a smaller amount of data and is used in applications where data is streamed, such as in telecommunications and real-time data encryption.

3. **Key Features**:
   - **Speed of Transformation**: Generally faster and uses less code than block ciphers.
   - **Error Propagation**: Minimal; <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">errors in a few bits do not propagate</mark> beyond their positions.
   - **Security**: Heavily dependent on the randomness of the keystream; <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">the same key must never be used twice</mark>.

#### Encryption and Decryption of Sequence Ciphers

1. **Encryption Process**:
   - **Keystream Generation**: A keystream is generated using a secret key, typically by a pseudo-random generator or derived from a smaller key.
   - **Combining Keystream with Plaintext**: <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Each bit (or byte) of the plaintext is encrypted one at a time by combining it with the corresponding bit (or byte) from the keystream, usually via an XOR operation</mark>.

2. **Decryption Process**:
   - **Keystream Regeneration**: The same keystream used for encryption is regenerated using the same secret key.
   - **Extracting the Plaintext**: <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">The encrypted stream is combined with the regenerated keystream using the same XOR process to yield the original plaintext</mark>.

3. **Security Considerations**:
   - **Key Uniqueness**: It is critical that the key is random and never reused; reuse can lead to vulnerabilities such as those exploited in two-time pad attacks.
   - **Keystream Security**: The security of stream ciphers is dependent on the unpredictability of the keystream; any predictability can be exploited to break the cipher.
### Block Ciphers

1. **Definition**: Block ciphers process <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">fixed-size blocks</mark> of data (e.g., 128, 192, 256 bits) using an algorithmic transformation and a symmetric key.

2. **Operation Mode**: Can operate in various modes, including ECB (Electronic Codebook), CBC (Cipher Block Chaining), and GCM (Galois/Counter Mode), each providing different security features.

3. **Key Features**:
   - **Data Integrity and Confidentiality**: Better suited for maintaining data <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">integrity and confidentiality over larger datasets.</mark>
   - **Error Propagation**: <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Errors can propagate</mark>; a single bit error affects the entire block and possibly subsequent blocks depending on the mode.
