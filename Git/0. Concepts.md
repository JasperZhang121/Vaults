### Version Control

Version control is a critical tool for software development that allows developers to manage and track changes made to their codebase over time. It is a way to collaborate with other developers, keep track of changes, and revert to a previous version if necessary.

### Git: A Popular Version Control System

One of the most popular version control systems is Git, which was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005. Git is a distributed version control system that enables developers to track changes to codebases and collaborate with other developers.

#### Key Features of Git

- **Distributed Architecture**: Every developer has a <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">local copy of the repository</mark>, and changes can be <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">pushed and pulled between repositories</mark>.
- **Branching and Merging**: Git allows developers to create <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">multiple branches</mark> of a codebase and merge them back into the main codebase when the feature is complete.
- **Versioning**: Git tracks changes to a codebase over time, enabling developers to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">revert to previous versions</mark> of the codebase if necessary.
- **Collaboration**: Git allows developers to collaborate on a codebase, making changes and pushing them to the repository for others to review and merge.

### Using Git

To use Git, developers must first initialize a repository. This can be done by running the `git init` command in the root directory of a project. Once a repository has been initialized, developers can start tracking changes to their codebase.

#### Common Git Commands

- `git add`: Add files or changes to the staging area.
- `git commit`: Commit changes to the repository.
- `git push`: Push changes to a remote repository.
- `git pull`: Pull changes from a remote repository.
- `git branch`: Create, list, or delete branches.
- `git merge`: Merge changes from one branch into another.

### Git Hosting Services

Developers can also use Git hosting services like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket to store their repositories remotely and collaborate with other developers.
