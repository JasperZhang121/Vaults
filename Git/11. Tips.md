### Unfinished Work Across Machines

#### 1. Create a New Temporary Branch

At the office:

```bash
git checkout -b temp-in-progress
```

This creates a new branch to isolate your unfinished work.

#### 2. Commit Your Work

Add and commit your changes to the temporary branch:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "WIP: Partial implementation of feature X"
```

#### 3. Push the Temporary Branch to Remote

Push the branch to the remote repository for access at home:

```bash
git push origin temp-in-progress
```

#### 4. Continue Working at Home

At home, fetch the branch and check it out:

```bash
git fetch origin
git checkout temp-in-progress
```

Make changes, commit, and push updates back to the remote:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "More work on feature X"
git push origin temp-in-progress
```

#### 5. Merge Changes to the Main Branch

Once your work is complete (either at home or at the office):

1. Switch to the main branch and update it:
    
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```
    
2. Merge the temporary branch:
    
```bash
git merge temp-in-progress
```

#### **6. Delete the Temporary Branch**

After merging, delete the temporary branch to clean up:

- Locally:
    
```bash
git branch -d temp-in-progress
```
    
- Remotely:
    
```bash
git push origin --delete temp-in-progress
```

### **Key Notes**

- Always commit unfinished work to the temporary branch before leaving your workstation.
- Avoid committing directly to the main branch to prevent unstable code.
- Use the temporary branch for isolation and flexibility.
- Push the branch to the remote for access across machines.
