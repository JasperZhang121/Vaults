### Stashing Changes
- **Stashing (`stash`)**:
  `git stash` temporarily shelves (or stashes) changes you've made to your working directory, allowing you to switch branches or work on something else without committing incomplete changes. To apply the stashed changes back to your working directory, use `git stash pop`.

### Tagging Specific Commits
- **Tagging (`tag`)**:
  `git tag <tag-name> <commit-hash>` is used to mark specific points in history as important, typically for releases (e.g., v1.0, v2.0). Tags can reference specific commits and serve as fixed reference points within the project's history.

### Rebasing and Its Advantages Over Merging
- **Rebasing (`rebase`)**:
  `git rebase <branch>` is used to move or combine a sequence of commits to a new base commit. Rebasing can create a cleaner, linear project history compared to merging.
  - **Advantages of Rebasing**:
    - Cleaner project history with fewer merge commits.
    - Often simplifies the process of resolving conflicts.
    - Helps in maintaining a linear and more readable history.

### Working with Large Files (Git LFS)
Git Large File Storage (LFS) is used for managing large files separately from the main Git repository:

1. **Install Git LFS**:
   ```bash
   git lfs install
   ```
   This sets up Git LFS in your repository.

2. **Track Large Files**:
   ```bash
   git lfs track "*.<type>"
   ```
   Replace `<type>` with the file extension to track (e.g., `.psd`, `.mp4`). This command tells Git LFS to manage files of this type.

3. **Commit `.gitattributes`**:
   ```bash
   git add .gitattributes
   git commit -m "Track large files with Git LFS"
   ```
   This commits the `.gitattributes` file, which stores the Git LFS tracking configurations.

4. **Add and Push Changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add file"
   git push
   ```
   After adding and committing your changes, push them to the remote repository. This will upload the large files to the Git LFS storage.
