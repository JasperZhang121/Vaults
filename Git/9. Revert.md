### 1. **Discard all uncommitted changes and staged files**

If you want to discard all changes in your working directory (both staged and unstaged) and return to the last commit:

```bash
git reset --hard HEAD
```

- `HEAD` refers to the most recent commit.
- Use this carefully because it discards uncommitted changes and cannot be undone.

### 2. **Unstage changes but keep them in the working directory**

If you want to keep the changes in your working directory but unstage them:

```bash
git reset HEAD
```

- This will remove changes from the staging area, allowing you to modify or re-add them later.

### 3. **Undo the last commit but keep the changes**

If you've already committed changes but want to undo the commit while keeping the changes in the working directory:

```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

- `--soft` keeps the changes staged for the next commit.
- `HEAD~1` refers to the commit just before the current one.

### 4. **Revert a commit (create a new commit that undoes the changes)**

If you want to undo a commit without losing the changes permanently, use:

```bash
git revert HEAD
```

- This creates a new commit that undoes the last commit.
- This is the safest option if you've already pushed the commit to a shared branch.

### 5. **View the log to confirm commit changes**

Before reverting, you can check your recent commit history using:

```bash
git log --oneline
```


**Note**: Be cautious with `git reset --hard` as it discards changes permanently unless they're backed up or committed elsewhere. Always double-check your work before running it.
