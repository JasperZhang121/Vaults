### Repositories

- **Initialize a Repository (`init`)**: 
  ```sh
  git init
  ```
  This command creates a new local Git repository in the current directory, establishing it as the root of a new repository.

- **Clone a Repository (`clone`)**: 
  ```sh
  git clone <repository-url>
  ```
  This command makes a copy of an existing repository, including all its history, branches, and files.

- **Check Repository Status (`status`)**:
  ```sh
  git status
  ```
  This command displays the state of the working directory and staging area, showing any changes that have been staged, are untracked, or have been modified.

### Staging Changes

- **Stage Changes (`add`)**:
  ```sh
  git add <file>
  ```
  This command adds a file’s changes to the staging area, preparing them for the next commit. Use `git add .` to stage all changes in the directory.

### Committing Changes

- **Commit Changes (`commit`)**:
  ```sh
  git commit -m "commit message"
  ```
  This command records the staged changes in the repository’s history with a descriptive message explaining the changes.

### Viewing the Commit History

- **View Commit History (`log`)**:
  ```sh
  git log
  ```
  This command shows the commit history for the current branch, listing each commit with its message, author, and date.
  - `git log --oneline` provides a condensed view of the commit history, showing each commit as a single line.

### Advanced Git Commands

- **Revert Changes in a Commit**:
  ```sh
  git revert <commit-hash>
  ```
  This command creates a new commit that undoes the changes made in the specified commit.

- **Discard Changes in the Working Directory**:
  ```sh
  git checkout -- <file-name>
  ```
  This command discards changes in the specified file, reverting it to the last committed state.

- **Rename a File**:
  ```sh
  git mv <old-file-name> <new-file-name>
  ```
  This command renames a file in the Git repository and stages the change for commit.

- **Merge**:
  - **Keep Another Branch’s Commits**:
    ```sh
    git merge <branch>
    ```
    This command merges the specified branch into the current branch, integrating its history and changes.

  - **Squash and Merge**:
    ```sh
    git merge --squash <branch>
    ```
    This command combines all the commits from the specified branch into a single commit in the current branch. After squashing, you need to commit the changes manually.

- **Abort Merge**:
  ```sh
  git merge --abort
  ```
  This command stops the merge process and attempts to revert back to the pre-merge state.

- **Rebase**:
  ```sh
  git rebase <branch>
  ```
  This command applies the commits from the current branch onto the specified branch, often used to maintain a linear project history.

- **branch**:
	- delete
	```shell
	git branch -d exampleBranch           # Delete locally
	git push origin --delete exampleBranch  # Delete remotely
	```
	- fetch all branches
	```shell
	git fetch --all
	```

### Example: Comprehensive Git Workflow

We will simulate a scenario where two developers, Alice and Bob, are working on the same project.

#### Step 1: Initializing and Cloning the Repository

1. Alice initializes a new repository:
   ```sh
   mkdir project
   cd project
   git init
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   Initialized empty Git repository in /path/to/project/.git/
   ```

2. Alice creates a remote repository on GitHub and adds it as a remote:
   ```sh
   git remote add origin https://github.com/alice/project.git
   ```

3. Bob clones the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/alice/project.git
   cd project
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   Cloning into 'project'...
   remote: Enumerating objects: 5, done.
   remote: Counting objects: 100% (5/5), done.
   remote: Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
   remote: Total 5 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
   Receiving objects: 100% (5/5), done.
   ```

#### Step 2: Creating Branches and Making Changes

1. Alice creates a new branch for her feature:
   ```sh
   git checkout -b feature-alice
   ```

2. Bob creates a new branch for his feature:
   ```sh
   git checkout -b feature-bob
   ```

3. Alice and Bob make changes in their respective branches and commit them:

   Alice:
   ```sh
   echo "Alice's code" > alice.txt
   git add alice.txt
   git commit -m "Add Alice's code"
   ```

   Bob:
   ```sh
   echo "Bob's code" > bob.txt
   git add bob.txt
   git commit -m "Add Bob's code"
   ```

#### Step 3: Pushing Changes to the Remote Repository

1. Alice pushes her changes:
   ```sh
   git push origin feature-alice
   ```

2. Bob pushes his changes:
   ```sh
   git push origin feature-bob
   ```

#### Step 4: Checking Repository Status

1. Alice checks the repository status:
   ```sh
   git status
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   On branch feature-alice
   nothing to commit, working tree clean
   ```

2. Bob checks the repository status:
   ```sh
   git status
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   On branch feature-bob
   nothing to commit, working tree clean
   ```

#### Step 5: Merging Changes

1. Alice merges her feature branch into the main branch:
   ```sh
   git checkout main
   git merge feature-alice
   git push origin main
   ```

2. Bob fetches the latest changes from the remote and merges his feature branch:
   ```sh
   git fetch origin
   git checkout main
   git merge origin/main
   git merge feature-bob
   git push origin main
   ```

#### Step 6: Resolving Conflicts (if any)

If there are any conflicts, Bob resolves them, stages the resolved files, commits, and pushes the changes:
   ```sh
   git add resolved_file.txt
   git commit -m "Resolve merge conflict"
   git push origin main
   ```

#### Step 7: Advanced Operations

1. Alice reverts a commit:
   ```sh
   git revert a1b2c3d
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   [main e4f5g6h] Revert "Add file.txt with initial content"
   1 file changed, 1 deletion(-)
   delete mode 100644 file.txt
   ```

2. Bob discards changes in a file:
   ```sh
   git checkout -- file.txt
   ```

3. Alice renames a file:
   ```sh
   git mv old_name.txt new_name.txt
   git commit -m "Rename old_name.txt to new_name.txt"
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   [main h1i2j3k] Rename old_name.txt to new_name.txt
   1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
   rename old_name.txt => new_name.txt (100%)
   ```

4. Alice merges Bob's branch:
   ```sh
   git checkout main
   git merge feature-bob
   ```

5. Alice squashes and merges Bob's branch:
   ```sh
   git merge --squash feature-bob
   git commit -m "Squash and merge feature-bob"
   ```

6. Bob aborts a merge:
   ```sh
   git merge --abort
   ```

7. Alice rebases her branch onto the main branch:
   ```sh
   git checkout feature-alice
   git rebase main
   ```
