### Repositories
- **Initialize a Repository (`init`)**: 
  `git init` creates a new local Git repository in the current directory, establishing it as the root of a new repository.
- **Clone a Repository (`clone`)**: 
  `git clone <repository-url>` makes a copy of an existing repository, including all its history, branches, and files.
- **Check Repository Status (`status`)**:
  `git status` displays the state of the working directory and staging area, showing any changes that have been staged, are untracked, or have been modified.

### Staging Changes
- **Stage Changes (`add`)**:
  `git add <file>` adds a file’s changes to the staging area, preparing them for the next commit. Use `git add .` to stage all changes in the directory.

### Committing Changes
- **Commit Changes (`commit`)**:
  `git commit -m "commit message"` records the staged changes in the repository’s history with a descriptive message explaining the changes.

### Viewing the Commit History
- **View Commit History (`log`)**:
  `git log` shows the commit history for the current branch, listing each commit with its message, author, and date.
  - `git log --oneline` provides a condensed view of the commit history, showing each commit as a single line.

### Advanced Git Commands
- **Revert Changes in a Commit**:
  `git revert <commit-hash>` creates a new commit that undoes the changes made in the specified commit.
- **Discard Changes in the Working Directory**:
  `git checkout -- <file-name>` discards changes in the specified file, reverting it to the last committed state.
- **Rename a File**:
  `git mv <old-file-name> <new-file-name>` renames a file in the Git repository and stages the change for commit.
- **Merge**:
  - **Keep Another Branch’s Commits**:
    `git merge <branch>` merges the specified branch into the current branch, integrating its history and changes.
  - **Squash and Merge**:
    `git merge --squash <branch>` combines all the commits from the specified branch into a single commit in the current branch. After squashing, you need to commit the changes manually.
- **Abort Merge**:
  `git merge --abort` stops the merge process and attempts to revert back to the pre-merge state.
- **Rebase**:
  `git rebase <branch>` applies the commits from the current branch onto the specified branch, often used to maintain a linear project history.
