### Initialization
To create a new Git repository in your project directory, follow these steps:

1. **Initialize the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git init
   ```
   This command creates a new `.git` directory in your current location, establishing it as the root of a new Git repository.

2. **Stage Files**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```
   This command adds all files in the current directory to the staging area, preparing them for the initial commit.

3. **Commit Changes**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```
   Creates the first commit in the repository with a message describing the commit. "Initial commit" is a common message for the first commit, indicating the start of the repository's history.

### Configuration

- **Check User Name and Email**:
  - To view the configured Git user name and email, use:
    ```bash
    git config user.name
    git config user.email
    ```
  - These commands display the user name and email configured in Git, which are important for identifying the author of the commits.

- **Setting User Name and Email**:
  - To set your Git user name and email globally (for all repositories on your system), use:
    ```bash
    git config --global user.name "Your Name"
    git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"
    ```
  - Replace `"Your Name"` and `"youremail@example.com"` with your actual name and email. These details will be used in your commits.

- **Setting Text Editor**:
  - To configure the default text editor for Git (e.g., Nano, Vim, or VS Code), use:
    ```bash
    git config --global core.editor "nano"
    ```
  - Replace `"nano"` with your preferred editor. This setting determines which editor Git opens for commit messages, rebase operations, etc.

- **Default Branch Name**:
  - To set the default name for the initial branch (e.g., `main` instead of `master`), use:
    ```bash
    git config --global init.defaultBranch "main"
    ```
  - This command sets `main` as the default branch name for new repositories.

### Viewing Git Config Settings

- To view all your Git configuration settings, use:
  ```bash
  git config --list
  ```
  This command displays all the Git configuration settings, including user name, email, default editor, and other preferences, providing a comprehensive overview of your Git setup.
