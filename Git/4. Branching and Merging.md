### Branches
Branches in Git are pointers to specific commits in a repository's history. They represent independent lines of development, allowing you to separate different features, fixes, or experiments into isolated environments. This separation makes it easier to manage changes without affecting the main or other development lines.

### Creating, listing, and switching branches
- **Creating branches**: To create a new branch, use the `git branch <branch-name>` command. This command creates a new branch pointing to the current commit, but it doesnâ€™t switch the working directory to the new branch.
- **Listing branches**: To list all the branches in your repository, use the `git branch` command. Add the `-a` flag to show both local and remote branches (`git branch -a`).
- **Switching branches**: To switch to an existing branch, use the `git checkout <branch-name>` command. This command will update the working directory to reflect the snapshot of the project stored in that branch. In recent versions of Git, the `git switch <branch-name>` command is preferred for switching branches, separating the functionality of checking out files and switching branches.

### Merging changes
Merging is the process of integrating changes from one branch into another. Use the `git merge <branch-name>` command to merge the changes from `<branch-name>` into the current branch. This will often be used to merge feature branches back into the main branch, like `master` or `main`.

- If the merge is straightforward and there are no conflicting changes, Git will perform a "fast-forward" merge.
- If there are divergent changes, Git will create a new "merge commit" that combines the changes from the merged branches.

### Resolving conflicts
Sometimes, when merging branches, Git cannot automatically resolve differences and will report a conflict. This happens when the same lines of code are altered differently in the two branches being merged.

1. **Identify conflicts**: Git marks the file as conflicted and modifies its content to show the conflicting changes from both branches.
2. **Resolve conflicts**: Open the conflicted files in a text editor or a merge tool and manually resolve the conflicts. This involves editing the files to fix the inconsistencies and deciding what the final code should look like.
3. **Mark as resolved**: After fixing the conflicts, use `git add <file>` to mark a file as resolved.
4. **Complete the merge**: Once all conflicts are resolved and marked as such, complete the merge process with `git commit`, which will create a merge commit.
