### Two situations

- **Situation 1**: You have a VPN, and you can open the GitHub website in your browser. This indicates that the command line does not use the VPN as a proxy when pulling/pushing code.

- **Situation 2**: You don't have a VPN. In this case, you can find some proxy IP addresses and ports on certain websites.

Solutions: Configure the HTTP proxy. The git commands are the same in Windows, Linux, and Mac OS:

Configure the socks5 proxy:

```shell
git config --global http.proxy socks5 127.0.0.1:7890
git config --global https.proxy socks5 127.0.0.1:7890
```


Configure the HTTP proxy:

```shell
git config --global http.proxy 127.0.0.1:7890
git config --global https.proxy 127.0.0.1:7890
```

### Note:

The host number (127.0.0.1) in the command is the host number of the proxy used (if your computer has a VPN, then your local machine can be regarded as the proxy host for accessing GitHub), so you can just fill in 127.0.0.1. Otherwise, fill in the IP address of the proxy host (the IP address you found online).

The port number (7890) in the command is the listening IP of the proxy software (if the proxy software does not display the port, then check the proxy server settings in Windows) or the proxy host. It can be obtained from the proxy server configuration. Otherwise, fill in the port number you found online.

The two protocols, socks5 and HTTP, are determined by the proxy software used. Different software has different support for these two protocols. If you're not sure, you can try both.
The host number and port number can be checked at the proxy settings (if you have a VPN, you need to check it).

Commands for checking the proxy:
```shell
git config --global --get http.proxy
git config --global --get https.proxy
```

Commands for canceling the proxy:
```shell
git config --global --unset http.proxy
git config --global --unset https.proxy 
```

### Resolving Proxy Conflicts for Git in Work and Personal Environments

When working on both personal and work Git repositories, you might encounter proxy conflicts, especially when switching between a personal proxy (e.g., for GitHub) and a company VPN. Here’s a structured approach to manage and resolve these issues:

#### 1. **Unset Proxy for Work Repositories**

If you’re connected to your company’s VPN and don’t need your personal proxy for work:

```bash
git config --global --unset http.proxy
git config --global --unset https.proxy
```

Alternatively, for the current session only:

```bash
unset http_proxy
unset https_proxy
```

#### 2. **Add Proxy Exceptions for Company Domains**

If you want to retain your personal proxy for GitHub but bypass it for company repositories:

- Add a `no_proxy` rule:
    
    ```bash
    export no_proxy="xxxx.xxxx.com"
    ```
    
- Configure Git to bypass the proxy for specific domains:
    
    ```bash
    git config --global http.noProxy xxxx.xxxx.com
    ```
