**SQL (Structured Query Language):**

- SQL is a standardized language used for managing and manipulating relational databases. It provides a set of commands and syntax for creating, modifying, and retrieving data from databases.
    
- SQL is divided into different categories based on the types of operations it performs:
    
    - **Data Definition Language (DDL)**: DDL statements are used to define the structure and schema of a database. They include commands such as CREATE, ALTER, and DROP for creating, modifying, and deleting database objects like tables, views, indexes, and constraints.
        
    - **Data Manipulation Language (DML)**: DML statements are used to manipulate and retrieve data within a database. They include commands such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE for querying, inserting, updating, and deleting data from tables.
        
    - **Data Control Language (DCL)**: DCL statements are used to control access to the database. They include commands such as GRANT and REVOKE for granting and revoking permissions to users and roles.
        
    - **Transaction Control Language (TCL)**: TCL statements are used to manage transactions within the database. They include commands such as COMMIT, ROLLBACK, and SAVEPOINT for controlling the atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID) properties of transactions.
        
- SQL statements are composed of keywords, clauses, and expressions:
    
    - **Keywords**: Keywords are reserved words that have specific meanings in SQL. Examples include SELECT, FROM, WHERE, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, JOIN, and ORDER BY.
        
    - **Clauses**: Clauses are components of SQL statements that define the specific operations and conditions. Examples include SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY, and JOIN clauses.
        
    - **Expressions**: Expressions are used to perform calculations, comparisons, and transformations on data within SQL statements. Examples include arithmetic expressions (+, -, *, /), comparison operators (=, <, >, <=, >=, <>), and logical operators (AND, OR, NOT).
        
- SQL allows you to perform various operations on databases and tables:
    
    - **Creating Databases and Tables**: You can create databases using the CREATE DATABASE statement and tables using the CREATE TABLE statement. You define the table structure, columns, data types, and constraints during table creation.
        
    - **Inserting and Modifying Data**: You can insert new data into tables using the INSERT INTO statement and modify existing data using the UPDATE statement. The data to be inserted or updated is specified using the appropriate column names and values.
        
    - **Querying Data**: The SELECT statement is used to query and retrieve data from one or more tables. You can specify conditions using the WHERE clause to filter the results and use functions for calculations, aggregations, and transformations.
        
    - **Joining Tables**: SQL provides various types of JOIN operations (e.g., INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL JOIN) to combine data from multiple tables based on related columns.
        
    - **Filtering Data**: The WHERE clause allows you to specify conditions to filter data based on specific criteria. You can use comparison operators, logical operators, and functions to construct complex conditions.
        
    - **Sorting Data**: The ORDER BY clause allows you to sort the retrieved data in ascending or descending order based on one or more columns.
        
    - **Grouping and Aggregating Data**: The GROUP BY clause is used to group rows based on one or more columns, and the HAVING clause allows you to filter the grouped data based on conditions. Aggregate functions like SUM, COUNT, AVG, MIN, and MAX can be used to perform calculations on grouped data.
        
    - **Modifying and Deleting Data**: The UPDATE statement is used to modify
