### 1. **CREATE VIEW** (Create a virtual table based on a query)

```sql
-- Create View Template
CREATE VIEW `view_name` AS
SELECT `column1`, `column2`
FROM `table_name`
WHERE `condition_column` = 'condition_value';
```

A view is a virtual table that shows the result of a query. You can query the view just like a regular table, but it doesn't store the data itselfâ€”it always reflects the underlying query's current result.

### 2. **ALTER VIEW** (Modify an existing view)

```sql
-- Alter View Template
ALTER VIEW `view_name` AS
SELECT `column1`, `column3`
FROM `table_name`
WHERE `condition_column` = 'new_condition_value';
```

Use `ALTER VIEW` to modify the query that defines an existing view.

### 3. **DROP VIEW** (Delete a view)

```sql
-- Drop View Template
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS `view_name`;
```

This deletes the view. The actual data in the base table remains unaffected since views are just virtual representations of the data.

### 4. **Using the View** (Querying a created view)

```sql
-- Select from View Template 
SELECT * FROM `view_name`;``
```

Once a view has been created, you can use it similarly to how you would use a table.
