### 1. **SET GLOBAL server_id** (Set a unique server ID for replication)

```sql
-- Set Global Server ID Template
SET GLOBAL server_id = [unique_id];
```

Each server involved in replication must have a unique `server_id`. Replace `[unique_id]` with a unique integer value for the server.

### 2: **Enable Binary Logging** (if not already enabled)

```cnf
[mysqld]
log-bin=mysql-bin
server_id=1
```

This is configured in the MySQL server's configuration file (`my.cnf` or `my.ini`), typically located in the server's main directory. 
- `log-bin=mysql-bin` enables binary logging and sets the base name for log files

```sql
sudo systemctl restart mysql
sudo service mysql restart
```

After saving changes to the configuration file, restart the MySQL server to apply the changes.

### 3. **SHOW MASTER STATUS** (Show the status of the binary log on the master server)

```sql
-- Show Master Status Template
SHOW MASTER STATUS;
```

This command displays the binary log file and position on the master server, which is needed for setting up replication on a slave server.

### 4. **CHANGE MASTER TO** (Set up replication with a master server)

**master:**

```sql
CREATE USER 'replication_user'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE ON *.* TO 'replication_user'@'%';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

The replication user with appropriate permissions and be accessible from the slave server.

**slave:**

```sql
-- Change Master To Template
CHANGE MASTER TO
    MASTER_HOST = 'master_host',
    MASTER_USER = 'replication_user',
    MASTER_PASSWORD = 'replication_password',
    MASTER_LOG_FILE = 'master_log_file',
    MASTER_LOG_POS = master_log_position;
```

This command sets up replication by specifying the master server's hostname, replication user, password, and the binary log file and position from the master (`SHOW MASTER STATUS`). Replace the placeholders with actual values.

### 5. **START SLAVE** (Start replication on a slave server)

```sql
-- Start Slave Template
START SLAVE;
```

This starts the replication process on the slave server.

### 6. **STOP SLAVE** (Stop replication on a slave server)

```sql
-- Stop Slave Template
STOP SLAVE;
```

This stops the replication process on the slave server.
