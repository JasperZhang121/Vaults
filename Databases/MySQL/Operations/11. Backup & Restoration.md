### 1. **mysqldump** (Command-line utility to back up databases)

```bash
-- Backup Database using mysqldump
mysqldump -u [username] -p [database_name] > [backup_file.sql]
```

This backs up the specified database into a `.sql` file. Replace `[username]`, `[database_name]`, and `[backup_file.sql]` with your MySQL username, the name of the database to back up, and the desired output file name.

For all databases:
```bash
-- Backup All Databases
mysqldump -u [username] -p --all-databases > [backup_file.sql]
```

### 2. **LOAD DATA INFILE** (Import data from an external file into a table)

```sql
-- Load Data Infile Template
LOAD DATA INFILE '/path/to/your/datafile.csv'
INTO TABLE `table_name`
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' 
ENCLOSED BY '"' 
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
IGNORE 1 ROWS;
```

This imports data from an external file (e.g., a CSV file) into the specified table. Modify the file path and adjust the `FIELDS TERMINATED BY`, `ENCLOSED BY`, and `LINES TERMINATED BY` parameters based on the file format.

### 3. **SELECT INTO OUTFILE** (Export query results to an external file)

```sql
-- Select Into Outfile Template
SELECT `column1`, `column2`
FROM `table_name`
INTO OUTFILE '/path/to/your/outputfile.csv'
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' 
ENCLOSED BY '"' 
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n';
```

This exports the result of a query into a file, typically a CSV file. Adjust the path and format parameters as needed.

### 4. **RESTORE** (Restore data from a backup)

```bash
-- Restore Database from Backup
mysql -u [username] -p [database_name] < [backup_file.sql]
```

This restores the database from a `.sql` backup file. Replace `[username]`, `[database_name]`, and `[backup_file.sql]` with your MySQL username, the name of the database to restore, and the path to the backup file.
