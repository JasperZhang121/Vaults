### 1. **START TRANSACTION** (Begin a transaction)

```sql
-- Start Transaction Template
START TRANSACTION;
-- Your SQL queries go here...
```

This begins a transaction. All subsequent queries will be part of this transaction until a `COMMIT` or `ROLLBACK` is issued.

### 2. **COMMIT** (Save all changes made during the current transaction)

```sql
-- Commit Transaction Template
COMMIT;
```

This will save all the changes made during the transaction and make them permanent.

### 3. **ROLLBACK** (Undo changes made during the current transaction)

```sql
-- Rollback Transaction Template
ROLLBACK;
```

This will undo all changes made during the current transaction, reverting the database to the state before `START TRANSACTION`.

### 4. **SAVEPOINT** (Set a point within a transaction that you can roll back to)

```sql
-- Savepoint Template
SAVEPOINT savepoint_name;

-- Rollback to a specific savepoint
ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT savepoint_name;

-- Release a savepoint
RELEASE SAVEPOINT savepoint_name;
```

This allows you to set multiple points within a transaction to which you can roll back without affecting the entire transaction.

### 5. **LOCK/UNLOCK TABLES** (Manually lock or unlock tables to control concurrency)

**Locking a table:**
```sql
-- Lock Table Template
LOCK TABLES `table_name` WRITE;

-- Your SQL queries go here...

-- Unlock the table
UNLOCK TABLES;
```

This locks a table for write operations to prevent other sessions from making changes while the lock is held. `UNLOCK TABLES` releases the lock, allowing other sessions to access the table.
