### 1. **LOCK TABLES** (Manually lock tables for a session)

```sql
-- Lock Tables Template
LOCK TABLES `table_name` READ;  -- Use READ or WRITE depending on the lock type
```

This locks the specified table. `READ` locks allow other sessions to read the table, but no writing is allowed. `WRITE` locks prevent other sessions from reading or writing to the table.

### 2. **UNLOCK TABLES** (Unlock tables)

```sql
-- Unlock Tables Template
UNLOCK TABLES;
```

This releases any locks that were set on the tables in the current session.

### 3. **SHOW OPEN TABLES** (Show which tables are currently in use)

```sql
-- Show Open Tables Template
SHOW OPEN TABLES
WHERE `In_use` > 0;
```

This shows tables that are currently in use (i.e., locked or being accessed by other sessions), with details about the number of active locks.
