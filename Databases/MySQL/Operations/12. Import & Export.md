### 1. **LOAD DATA INFILE** (Import large amounts of data efficiently)

```sql
-- LOAD DATA INFILE Template
LOAD DATA INFILE '/path/to/your/datafile.csv'
INTO TABLE `table_name`
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','  -- Define the field delimiter
ENCLOSED BY '"'           -- Define the enclosing character for fields
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'   -- Define the line terminator (for new lines)
IGNORE 1 ROWS;            -- Skip the first row (usually header row)
```

This template imports data from a CSV or other file format into a MySQL table efficiently. You can adjust the file path and delimiter based on your data file format. `IGNORE 1 ROWS` is commonly used to skip the header row of a CSV file.

### 2. **SELECT INTO OUTFILE** (Export the results of a query into a file)

```sql
-- SELECT INTO OUTFILE Template
SELECT `column1`, `column2`, `column3`
FROM `table_name`
INTO OUTFILE '/path/to/your/outputfile.csv'
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','  -- Define the field delimiter
ENCLOSED BY '"'           -- Define the enclosing character for fields
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n';  -- Define the line terminator (for new lines)
```

This template exports the result of a query to a CSV or other file format. You can adjust the file path and delimiter based on your desired output format. The `FIELDS TERMINATED BY` and `ENCLOSED BY` clauses help structure the exported file, while `LINES TERMINATED BY` ensures proper line breaks.
