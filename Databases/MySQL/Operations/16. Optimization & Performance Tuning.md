### 1. **ANALYZE TABLE** (Analyze and optimize table performance)

```sql
-- Analyze Table Template
ANALYZE TABLE `table_name`;
```

This command updates table statistics used by the MySQL optimizer to determine the most efficient way to execute queries.

### 2. **OPTIMIZE TABLE** (Reorganize and reclaim space)

```sql
-- Optimize Table Template
OPTIMIZE TABLE `table_name`;
```

This reorganizes the table's storage to improve performance and reclaim unused space. It is often used after heavy updates or deletions.

### 3. **EXPLAIN** (Show how MySQL executes a query)

```sql
-- Explain Query Template
EXPLAIN SELECT `column1`, `column2`
FROM `table_name`
WHERE `condition_column` = 'condition_value';
```

This provides a detailed breakdown of how MySQL plans to execute the query, helping with query optimization.

### 4. **SHOW STATUS** (Display server status information)

```sql
-- Show Status Template
SHOW STATUS;
```

This displays a variety of server status variables, including information about performance, resource usage, and connections.

### 5. **SHOW PROCESSLIST** (View active MySQL processes)

```sql
-- Show Processlist Template
SHOW PROCESSLIST;
```

This command displays currently running MySQL processes, including connections, queries, and locks, helping identify slow queries or performance bottlenecks.
