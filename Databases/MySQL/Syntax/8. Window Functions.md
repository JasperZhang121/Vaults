### Overview
- **Window Functions**: Perform calculations across a set of rows that are somehow related to the current row.
- **Partition**: The set of rows considered by a function is called a "window," and it can be partitioned by one or more columns.
- **Frame**: Within a partition, the window can be further defined by a frame, specifying which rows to include in the calculation relative to the current row.

### Key Functions
1. **Aggregation Functions**: `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `COUNT()`, `MIN()`, `MAX()` can be used as window functions to perform calculations over a set of rows.
2. **Ranking Functions**:
   - `ROW_NUMBER()`: Assigns a unique number to each row starting from 1.
   - `RANK()`: Assigns a rank to each row, with gaps in the ranking for tied rows.
   - `DENSE_RANK()`: Similar to `RANK()`, but without gaps in the ranking for tied rows.
   - `NTILE(n)`: Distributes the rows in an ordered partition into a specified number of approximately equal groups.
3. **Analytic Functions**:
   - `LEAD()`, `LAG()`: Access data from a subsequent or preceding row in the partition.
   - `FIRST_VALUE()`, `LAST_VALUE()`: Get the first or last value in a partition.

### Syntax
```sql
SELECT column_name,
       WINDOW_FUNCTION(column_name) OVER (
           PARTITION BY column_name
           ORDER BY column_name
           [frame_clause]
       ) AS alias_name
FROM table_name;
```
- **PARTITION BY**: Divides the result set into partitions. The window function is applied to each partition separately and independently.
- **ORDER BY**: Determines the order of the rows in each partition.
- **Frame Clause**: Specifies the range of rows used for each calculation.

### Use Cases
- **Calculating Running Totals**: Use `SUM() OVER` to calculate a running total.
- **Moving Averages**: Use `AVG() OVER` with a frame clause to calculate moving averages.
- **Ranking**: Use ranking functions to assign ranks to rows based on their values.
- **Comparing Rows**: Use `LEAD()` and `LAG()` to compare values in different rows.

### Examples

**Running Total Example**:
```sql
SELECT date,
       sales,
       SUM(sales) OVER (ORDER BY date) AS running_total
FROM sales_table;
```

**Ranking Example**:
```sql
SELECT name,
       score,
       RANK() OVER (ORDER BY score DESC) AS rank
FROM scores_table;
```

### Best Practices
- Use `PARTITION BY` wisely to avoid performance issues with large datasets.
- Be mindful of the default frame when using aggregation functions; it may affect your results.
- Test your window function queries thoroughly, especially when dealing with complex partitions or frames.
