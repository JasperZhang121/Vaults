### SQL Statement Precedence

SQL statements are executed in a specific order based on their precedence, which is determined by the SQL standard. Here is a general order of precedence for SQL statements:

#### 1. FROM Clause
This is where the data is retrieved from. It specifies the table or tables from which to select or delete data.

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM employees;
```

#### 2. WHERE Clause
This is where filtering is applied to the data retrieved from the FROM clause. It specifies the conditions that must be met for the rows to be included in the results.

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM employees 
WHERE department = 'Sales';
```

#### 3. GROUP BY Clause
This is where the data is grouped into sets. It arranges identical data into groups.

```sql
SELECT department, COUNT(*) 
FROM employees 
WHERE department = 'Sales' 
GROUP BY department;
```

#### 4. HAVING Clause
This is where filtering is applied to the grouped data. It specifies conditions that filter which groups are included in the results.

```sql
SELECT department, COUNT(*) 
FROM employees 
GROUP BY department 
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;
```

#### 5. SELECT Clause
This is where the columns to be returned are specified. It determines which columns should be included in the results.

```sql
SELECT department, COUNT(*) 
FROM employees 
GROUP BY department 
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;
```

#### 6. ORDER BY Clause
This is where the data is sorted. It specifies the order in which to return the rows.

```sql
SELECT department, COUNT(*) 
FROM employees 
GROUP BY department 
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5 
ORDER BY department;
```

#### 7. LIMIT/OFFSET Clauses
These are used to limit the number of rows returned by the query. They specify the number of rows to return and optionally the number of rows to skip before starting to return rows.

```sql
SELECT department, COUNT(*) 
FROM employees 
GROUP BY department 
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5 
ORDER BY department 
LIMIT 10 OFFSET 5;
```
