- Data types in MySQL define the kind of data that can be stored in a column of a table. Each column in a table is assigned a specific data type, which determines the range of values it can hold and the operations that can be performed on it.
    
- MySQL provides a wide range of data types to accommodate different types of data. Here are some commonly used data types:
    
    - **Numeric Data Types**:
        
        - **INTEGER**: Used for storing whole numbers. It can be signed (e.g., INT) or unsigned (e.g., UNSIGNED INT) with varying storage sizes.
            
        - **DECIMAL**: Used for storing decimal numbers with precise decimal points. The precision and scale can be specified to define the maximum number of digits and the number of digits after the decimal point.
            
        - **FLOAT**: Used for storing floating-point numbers with approximate decimal precision. It is often used for scientific or large-value calculations.
            
        - **DOUBLE**: Used for storing double-precision floating-point numbers with higher precision than FLOAT.
            
    - **String Data Types**:
        
        - **CHAR**: Used for storing fixed-length strings with a specified length. It is suitable for storing short strings where the length is known in advance.
            
        - **VARCHAR**: Used for storing variable-length strings with a maximum specified length. It is suitable for storing strings of varying lengths.
            
        - **TEXT**: Used for storing large variable-length strings. It can store large amounts of text data, such as paragraphs or entire documents.
            
    - **Date and Time Data Types**:
        
        - **DATE**: Used for storing dates in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD'.
            
        - **TIME**: Used for storing time values in the format 'HH:MM:SS'.
            
        - **DATETIME**: Used for storing both date and time values in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'.
            
        - **TIMESTAMP**: Used for storing a timestamp, which represents a specific point in time. It is often used for recording the creation or modification time of a row.
            
    - **Boolean Data Types**:
        
        - **BOOLEAN**: Used for storing boolean values, which can be either TRUE or FALSE. In MySQL, boolean values are represented as 1 (TRUE) or 0 (FALSE).
    - **Binary Data Types**:
        
        - **BINARY**: Used for storing fixed-length binary data with a specified length.
            
        - **VARBINARY**: Used for storing variable-length binary data with a maximum specified length.
            
        - **BLOB**: Used for storing large variable-length binary data, such as images or multimedia files.
