Spring Data Redis provides a high-level abstraction for executing common Redis commands. The `RedisTemplate` class is the centerpiece of the Spring Data Redis library.

1. **What is RedisTemplate?**
    `RedisTemplate` is a class provided by Spring Data Redis, which simplifies the interaction with Redis by abstracting the low-level details of the connection and data manipulation, allowing us to perform operations on the Redis server using high-level methods.

2. **How to use RedisTemplate?**
    To use `RedisTemplate`, first need to configure a `RedisTemplate` bean in the application context. Here's an example:
    ```java
    @Bean
    public RedisTemplate<String, Object> redisTemplate(RedisConnectionFactory connectionFactory) {
        RedisTemplate<String, Object> template = new RedisTemplate<>();
        template.setConnectionFactory(connectionFactory);
        return template;
    }
    ```
    In this example, we define a `RedisTemplate` bean that connects to Redis server using a connection factory. This `RedisTemplate` bean can be autowired into other beans in your application context that need to interact with Redis.

3. **Basic Operations with RedisTemplate**
    Here are examples of how to perform basic operations:
    - **Setting a value**
        ```java
        redisTemplate.opsForValue().set("key", "value");
        ```
    - **Getting a value**
        ```java
        String value = (String) redisTemplate.opsForValue().get("key");
        ```
    In these examples, `opsForValue()` returns an object that provides methods for common operations when dealing with a Redis key/value structure.

4. **RedisTemplate and Serialization**
    `RedisTemplate` uses the JdkSerializationRedisSerializer for both keys and values by default, which means the data is stored in a binary format in Redis. If you want to change the default serialization method, you can do so by setting a different serializer. Here's an example where we use a StringRedisSerializer for keys:
    ```java
    template.setKeySerializer(new StringRedisSerializer());
    ```
