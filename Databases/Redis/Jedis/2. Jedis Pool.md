# Jedis Connection Pool

Connection pooling can greatly improve the performance of your application if you need to make numerous connections to your Redis server. Here's how you can use it with Jedis:

1. **Initialization**
    You need to initialize the `JedisPool` object. Here's an example:
    ```java
    JedisPool jedisPool = new JedisPool(new JedisPoolConfig(), "localhost", 6379);
    ```
    In the code above, the `JedisPoolConfig` object holds the configuration for the pool (like max total connections, max idle connections, etc). The other parameters are the host and port of the Redis server.

2. **Getting a Connection**
    To get a `Jedis` connection from the pool, you can use the `getResource()` method, like this:
    ```java
    Jedis jedis = jedisPool.getResource();
    ```

3. **Using the Connection**
    After you've obtained a `Jedis` instance, you can use it like you normally would to interact with Redis:
    ```java
    jedis.set("key", "value");
    ```

4. **Returning the Connection**
    When you're done with a `Jedis` instance, you should return it to the pool so that it can be reused:
    ```java
    jedis.close();
    ```
    Remember to always return Jedis instances to the pool when you've finished using them, because if you don't, the pool could become depleted, and your application may become unresponsive if it can't get a connection when it needs one.

5. **Closing the Pool**
    When you're done with the pool (typically when your application is shutting down), you should close it:
    ```java
    jedisPool.close();
    ```
    Remember that the Jedis connection pool is thread-safe. If you have multiple threads in your application, they can safely share a single `JedisPool` instance. However, each thread should have its own `Jedis` instance (obtained via `getResource()`) that it does not share with other threads.


### Example

```java
//JedisConnectionFactory.java

import redis.clients.jedis.Jedis;  
import redis.clients.jedis.JedisPool;  
import redis.clients.jedis.JedisPoolConfig;  
  
public class JedisConnectionFactory {  
  
    private static final JedisPool jedispool;  
  
    static {  
        JedisPoolConfig poolConfig = new JedisPoolConfig();  
        poolConfig.setMaxTotal(8);  
        poolConfig.setMaxIdle(0);  
        poolConfig.setMaxWaitMillis(1000);  
  
        jedispool = new JedisPool(poolConfig,"localhost",6379, 1000, "password");  
    }  
  
    public static Jedis getJedis(){  
        return jedispool.getResource();  
    }  
}
```


```java
// jedis.java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.AfterEach;  
import org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeEach;  
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;  
import redis.clients.jedis.Jedis;  
  
public class jedis {  
  
    private Jedis jedis;  
  
    @BeforeEach  
    void setUp(){   
        jedis = JedisConnectionFactory.getJedis(); 
    }  
  
    @Test  
    void testString(){  
        String result = jedis.set("name","jas");  
        System.out.println(result);  
        var name = jedis.get("name");  
        System.out.println("name = "+name);  
    }  
  
  
    @Test  
    void testHash(){  
        jedis.hset("user:1","name","jas");  
        jedis.hset("user:1","age","21");  
        var map = jedis.hgetAll("user:1");  
        System.out.println(map);  
    }  
  
    @AfterEach  
    void teardown(){  
        if (jedis !=null){  
            jedis.close();  
        }  
    }  
}
