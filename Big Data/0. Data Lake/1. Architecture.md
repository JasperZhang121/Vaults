### Ingestion Layer

#### Batch Ingestion
Batch ingestion involves <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">loading data in large chunks at scheduled intervals</mark>. This can be achieved using tools like:

- **Apache Sqoop**: Used for <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">transferring bulk data between Apache Hadoop and structured datastores such as relational databases</mark>.
- **Apache Flume**: Designed for efficiently collecting, aggregating, and moving large amounts of log data.
- **Custom ETL Jobs**: Tailor-made Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes using various scripting and programming languages.

#### Real-time Ingestion
Real-time ingestion handles continuous data streams to capture data in real-time. Tools commonly used include:

- **Apache Kafka**: A distributed streaming platform capable of <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">handling high throughput for real-time data feeds</mark>.
- **AWS Kinesis**: A service for real-time processing of streaming data at massive scale on AWS.
- **Azure Event Hubs**: A big data streaming platform and event ingestion service on Azure.

### Storage Layer

#### Distributed File Systems
Distributed file systems offer <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">scalable storage solutions</mark> for large datasets. Commonly used systems include:

- **Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)**: A primary storage system for Hadoop applications, offering high throughput access to data.
- **Amazon S3**: Scalable object storage service provided by AWS.
- **Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS)**: Scalable and secure data lake storage for high-performance analytics workloads on Azure.

#### Object Storage
Object storage is used for storing large amounts of unstructured data. S3-compatible storage solutions are widely used for their scalability and cost-effectiveness.

### Processing Layer

#### Batch Processing
Batch processing frameworks handle large-scale data <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">processing jobs that run at scheduled intervals</mark>. Common tools include:

- **Apache Spark**: Provides fast, in-memory data processing capabilities and supports batch processing.
- **Apache Flink**: A stream-processing framework with support for batch processing.
- **Hadoop MapReduce**: A programming model for processing large data sets with a distributed algorithm on a Hadoop cluster.

#### Stream Processing
Stream processing frameworks handle <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">continuous data streams for real-time analysis</mark>. Common tools include:

- **Apache Kafka Streams**: A client library for building applications and microservices, where the input and output data are stored in Kafka clusters.
- **Apache Flink**: Provides high-throughput, low-latency stream processing.
- **Apache Storm**: A distributed real-time computation system for processing data streams.

### Catalog and Search

#### Metadata Management
Metadata management tools help in organizing and managing data catalogs. Common tools include:

- **Apache Hive**: A data warehouse infrastructure built on top of Hadoop for providing data summarization, query, and analysis.
- **AWS Glue**: A fully managed ETL service that makes it easy to prepare and load data for analytics.
- **Azure Data Catalog**: A fully managed cloud service that serves as a system for registering, enriching, discovering, understanding, and consuming data sources.

#### Search and Indexing
Search and indexing tools enable efficient data retrieval and exploration. Common tools include:

- **Elasticsearch**: A distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine capable of solving a growing number of use cases.
- **Solr**: An open-source search platform built on Apache Lucene.

### Consumption Layer

#### Data Analytics
Data analytics tools facilitate querying and analyzing data stored in Data Lakes. Common tools include:

- **Apache Hive**: Provides a SQL-like interface to query data stored in various databases and file systems.
- **Presto**: A distributed SQL query engine for big data.
- **AWS Redshift**: A fully managed data warehouse service in the cloud.
- **Google BigQuery**: A serverless, highly scalable, and cost-effective multi-cloud data warehouse.

#### Machine Learning
Machine learning tools and frameworks enable building, training, and deploying machine learning models. Common tools include:

- **TensorFlow**: An open-source machine learning framework.
- **PyTorch**: An open-source machine learning library based on the Torch library.
- **Apache Mahout**: A machine learning library to build scalable algorithms.

#### Visualization
Visualization tools help in creating interactive and shareable dashboards. Common tools include:

- **Tableau**: An interactive data visualization software.
- **Power BI**: A business analytics service by Microsoft.
- **Kibana**: An open-source data visualization dashboard for Elasticsearch.
