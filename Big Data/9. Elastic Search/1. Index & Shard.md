 ### Index

An **index** in Elasticsearch is a <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">collection of documents</mark> that share common characteristics and is the primary structure where data is stored. Conceptually, it is similar to a table in a relational database like MySQL or PostgreSQL, but with key differences that reflect Elasticsearch’s focus on distributed systems and full-text search.

#### Key Aspects of an Index:

1. **Document Storage**  
   Every piece of data in Elasticsearch is stored in the form of a **document**, which is a JSON object containing fields (key-value pairs). All documents within an index typically represent similar types of data. For instance, in an e-commerce application, you might have an index called `products` that stores documents related to product details, or an index called `customers` to store customer-related information.

   **Example:**
   ```json
   {
     "name": "Smartphone",
     "brand": "TechCo",
     "price": 699.99,
     "release_date": "2024-01-01"
   }
   ```

2. **Mappings**  
   While Elasticsearch is schema-free, it offers the option to define **mappings** for an index. A mapping defines the structure of the documents in the index, specifying the data types for each field (e.g., `text`, `keyword`, `integer`, `date`). Mappings are important for optimizing search and query performance.

   **Example Mapping:**
   ```json
   {
     "mappings": {
       "properties": {
         "name": { "type": "text" },
         "brand": { "type": "keyword" },
         "price": { "type": "float" },
         "release_date": { "type": "date" }
       }
     }
   }
   ```
   This mapping ensures that `name` is analyzed for full-text search, `brand` is stored as a keyword (for exact matches), and `price` and `release_date` are treated as numeric and date fields, respectively.

3. **Indexing and Querying**  
   An index allows you to efficiently **index** (store) and **query** documents. When documents are indexed, Elasticsearch creates an **inverted index**, a data structure optimized for fast full-text searches. Elasticsearch also supports rich queries, including full-text searches, filtering, and sorting, all of which are executed on the documents within an index.

   **Example Query:**
   A query to find all products in the `products` index where the `name` contains the word "smartphone":
   ```bash
   GET /products/_search
   {
     "query": {
       "match": {
         "name": "smartphone"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Multi-index Queries**  
   Elasticsearch allows querying across multiple indices simultaneously. This is useful when your data is partitioned into different indices but you need to search across them.

   **Example:**  
   You can search across `products`, `customers`, and `orders` indices in a single query:
   ```bash
   GET /products,customers,orders/_search
   {
     "query": {
       "match_all": {}
     }
   }
   ```

5. **Index Lifecycle**  
   Elasticsearch also supports **Index Lifecycle Management (ILM)**, which automates managing indices over time, especially as they grow in size. ILM can automatically move indices through different phases such as **hot**, **warm**, **cold**, and **delete**, optimizing performance and storage usage.

### Shard

A **shard** is a fundamental component of Elasticsearch’s distributed architecture. It is a self-contained and independent instance of Apache Lucene, the underlying search engine used by Elasticsearch. Each index is divided into one or more **primary shards**, which can be further **replicated** across nodes to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.

#### Key Aspects of Shards:

1. **Primary Shards**  
   When you create an index in Elasticsearch, you define the number of primary shards. These shards <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">contain the actual data of the index and handle read and write requests</mark>. By default, an index in Elasticsearch has 1 primary shard, but this can be configured based on your needs.

   **Example:**  
   When creating an index, you can specify the number of primary shards:
   ```bash
   PUT /products
   {
     "settings": {
       "number_of_shards": 3
     }
   }
   ```
   This will create the `products` index with 3 primary shards. The data will be distributed evenly across these shards.

2. **Replica Shards**  
   To ensure fault tolerance and high availability, Elasticsearch allows you to create **replica shards**. These replicas are exact copies of the primary shards and are stored on different nodes in the cluster to avoid data loss in case of a node failure.

   **Example:**  
   By default, each primary shard has 1 replica, but this can be increased:
   ```bash
   PUT /products
   {
     "settings": {
       "number_of_replicas": 1
     }
   }
   ```
   This creates 1 replica for each primary shard. If a node containing a primary shard fails, Elasticsearch automatically promotes the replica to a primary shard to continue handling requests.

3. **Shard Allocation and Rebalancing**  
   Elasticsearch automatically manages shard allocation across nodes. When new nodes are added to the cluster, Elasticsearch will **rebalance** the shards, distributing them across all available nodes to ensure even data and query load distribution.

   **Example:**  
   If you add a new node to a cluster, Elasticsearch will move shards from the existing nodes to the new node to balance the cluster. This ensures that no single node is overloaded with too much data or too many queries.

4. **Parallelization**  
   Shards are key to Elasticsearch’s ability to scale horizontally. By dividing data across shards, Elasticsearch allows queries to run in parallel. Each shard can process a portion of the query independently, and the results are merged before being returned to the user.

   **Example:**  
   Suppose you search for documents in an index that is split into 5 shards. Elasticsearch will route the query to all 5 shards in parallel, gather the results, and return them as one aggregated response. This parallelism ensures that queries can be handled efficiently, even with large datasets.

5. **Shard Failover and Replication**  
   Elasticsearch monitors the health of all shards in the cluster. If a shard becomes unavailable (e.g., due to node failure), Elasticsearch automatically promotes a replica to a primary shard and reallocates it to another node. This ensures no data loss and minimal downtime.

   **Example:**  
   Suppose your cluster has 3 nodes, and each shard has 1 replica. If one node goes down, Elasticsearch automatically reassigns the replica shards to the remaining two nodes, ensuring continued availability.

6. **Shard Sizing**  
   While Elasticsearch can handle large data volumes, it is important to ensure that shards are sized correctly. Overly large shards can lead to memory issues, slow recovery times, and reduced query performance. The recommended size for a shard is typically between 10GB and 50GB, but this depends on your use case and the nature of your data.

### How Indexes and Shards Work Together

When you create an index in Elasticsearch, you are essentially creating a **logical container** for your data, and each document within that index is distributed across the primary shards. These shards allow Elasticsearch to scale and handle large amounts of data efficiently by distributing both data storage and query processing across multiple nodes.

For example, if you have an index with 5 primary shards and 1 replica, Elasticsearch creates a total of 10 shards (5 primary + 5 replicas) and distributes them across the available nodes. When a query is executed, Elasticsearch splits the query across all primary and replica shards, processes it in parallel, and combines the results for fast response times.

#### Example Scenario:

Suppose you have an e-commerce application with millions of product listings. You create an index called `products` with 10 primary shards and 1 replica. The data is distributed as follows:

- 10 primary shards, each holding a portion of the product listings
- 10 replica shards, ensuring that the data is backed up in case of node failure

When a user searches for a product, Elasticsearch routes the query to all 10 primary shards (or their replicas), processes the search in parallel, and returns the results in a matter of milliseconds. This scalability ensures that your search functionality remains fast, even with a large volume of data.
