### Introduction to Hadoop

Hadoop is an open-source framework designed for <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">distributed storage and processing of large datasets across clusters of commodity hardware</mark>. It provides a scalable and fault-tolerant solution for processing and analyzing vast amounts of data.

### Key Components of Hadoop

**Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS):** HDFS is a distributed file system that stores data across multiple machines in a cluster. It provides high-throughput access to large datasets.

**MapReduce:** <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">MapReduce is a programming model and processing framework</mark> for distributed data processing in Hadoop. It enables parallel processing of data by dividing tasks into map and reduce phases.

**YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator):** YARN is the <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">resource management layer</mark> of Hadoop. It allows multiple applications to run on the same cluster while efficiently managing resources.

### Advantages of Hadoop

**Scalability:** Hadoop can handle large-scale data processing by distributing the workload across multiple nodes in a cluster, making it highly scalable.

**Fault Tolerance:** Hadoop provides fault tolerance by automatically <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">replicating data across multiple nodes</mark>. If a node fails, the data can still be accessed from other replicas.

**Cost-Effectiveness:** Hadoop utilizes commodity hardware, making it a cost-effective solution for storing and processing large datasets compared to traditional storage and processing systems.

**Flexibility:** Hadoop is flexible and can handle structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data, allowing organizations to work with diverse data types.

**Parallel Processing:** Hadoop's MapReduce model enables parallel processing of data, leading to faster data processing and analysis.

### Use Cases of Hadoop

**Batch Processing:** Hadoop is well-suited for batch processing tasks such as log analysis, data cleansing, and large-scale data transformations.

**Data Warehousing:** Hadoop can be used for building data warehouses that store and process large volumes of structured and semi-structured data for business intelligence and analytics.

**Data Lake:** Hadoop's ability to handle diverse data types makes it suitable for building data lakes that serve as a centralized repository for storing raw and processed data for analytics purposes.

**Machine Learning:** Hadoop can be integrated with machine learning frameworks to perform distributed training and processing of machine learning models on large datasets.

### Hadoop Ecosystem

- Hadoop has a vast ecosystem of tools and technologies that extend its capabilities, including Apache Hive, Apache Pig, Apache Spark, Apache HBase, and Apache Kafka.

#### Apache Hive
- Provides a SQL-like query language (HiveQL) for querying and analyzing data stored in Hadoop, making it easier for users familiar with SQL to work with Hadoop.

#### Apache Pig
- A high-level data flow scripting language used for creating data pipelines and performing data transformations in Hadoop.

#### Apache Spark
- A fast and general-purpose distributed computing system that provides in-memory data processing capabilities, making it suitable for real-time and iterative data processing tasks.

#### Other Components
- **HBase:** A scalable, distributed database that supports structured data storage for large tables.
- **Sqoop:** A tool designed for efficiently transferring bulk data between Hadoop and structured datastores such as relational databases.
- **Oozie:** A workflow scheduler system to manage Hadoop jobs.

#### Core Concepts

- **Cluster:** A group of computers (nodes) that work together to perform distributed processing.
- **Daemon:** A background process that supports the Hadoop ecosystem, such as the Namenode and Datanode for HDFS, and the JobTracker and TaskTracker for MapReduce.
- **Job:** A unit of work that includes a MapReduce task or any other processing task that can be executed within the Hadoop ecosystem.

#### Operations

- **Data Processing:** Data is split into blocks, processed in parallel using MapReduce tasks, and stored in HDFS.
- **Resource Management:** YARN allocates system resources (CPU, memory) and schedules tasks to optimize cluster utilization.
- **Fault Tolerance:** Data is replicated across multiple Datanodes to ensure availability in case of node failure.
