### File System Namespace
- **Structure**: The file system is organized in a hierarchical structure similar to traditional file systems, with directories and subdirectories.
```
/user/
    ├── alice/
    │       ├── data.txt
    │       └── report.pdf
    └── bob/
            ├── image.png
            └── notes.txt
```
- **Mapping**: The <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">NameNode maintains a mapping of file paths to metadata</mark>, allowing users to access files using standard file path syntax.

- **Namespace Operations**: Operations such as creating, deleting, and renaming files and directories modify the namespace and are tracked by the NameNode.

### Block Metadata
- **Block Size**: <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Files in HDFS are split into blocks (default is 128 MB)</mark>. Larger files are divided into multiple blocks, while smaller files may occupy a single block.
- **Block ID**: Each block has a unique identifier that is used to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">track its location</mark> and status across the DataNodes.
- **Block Location**: The NameNode keeps <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">a record of which DataNodes contain each block's replicas</mark>. This is essential for fault tolerance and load balancing.
```
Block 1: 
    - Block ID: blk_0001
    - Size: 128 MB
    - Locations: DataNode1, DataNode2

Block 2: 
    - Block ID: blk_0002
    - Size: 64 MB
    - Locations: DataNode2, DataNode3
```

### Replication Factor
- **Default Setting**: The <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">default replication factor is usually set to 3</mark>, meaning each block is replicated on three different DataNodes.
- **Customization**: Users can set a different replication factor on a per-file basis during file creation. This allows for flexibility based on data importance and required reliability.
- **Replica Management**: The NameNode monitors the health of replicas and can re-replicate blocks if a DataNode fails or if the number of replicas falls below the desired count.
```
Replica Locations:
    - blk_0001: DataNode1, DataNode2, DataNode3
    - blk_0002: DataNode2, DataNode3, DataNode4
```

### File Attributes
- **Ownership**: <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Each file and directory has an associated owner and group</mark>. This information is crucial for access control.
- **Permissions**: HDFS supports a POSIX-like permission model, allowing for read, write, and execute permissions for user, group, and others.
- **Timestamps**: HDFS records three timestamps:
  - **Creation Time**: When the file was created.
  - **Modification Time**: Last time the file's content was modified.
  - **Access Time**: Last time the file was accessed (though this feature can be disabled for performance reasons).

```
Ownership:
    - Owner: alice
    - Group: users

Permissions:
    - rw-r--r--  # Owner: read/write, Group: read, Others: read

Timestamps:
    - Creation Time: 2024-09-01 08:30:00
    - Modification Time: 2024-09-22 10:00:00
    - Access Time: 2024-09-21 15:45:00  # (Access time tracking can be disabled for performance)
```
### DataNode Information
- **Registration**: DataNodes register themselves with the NameNode during startup. This process involves sending their <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">storage capacity, available space, and other health metrics</mark>.
- **Heartbeat Mechanism**: DataNodes send heartbeat signals to the NameNode at regular intervals (typically every 3 seconds). <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">If the NameNode stops receiving heartbeats from a DataNode, it considers that DataNode dead and initiates replication of its blocks</mark>.
- **Block Reports**: DataNodes periodically send block reports to the NameNode, which contain information about all blocks stored on that DataNode. This ensures the NameNode has up-to-date block location information.

### Transaction Logs
- **Edit Logs**: The NameNode writes all changes to the filesystem namespace to an edit log. This log is crucial for recovering from failures. 
- **Checkpointing**: Periodically, the NameNode performs a checkpoint operation, which involves merging the edit log with the current namespace image to create a new snapshot of the filesystem. This helps in managing the size of the edit log.

### Namespace Image
- **Image File**: The namespace image is a binary file stored on the NameNode, containing the current state of the filesystem (directory structure and file metadata).
- **Recovery Process**: In the event of a NameNode failure, the namespace image, combined with the edit log, allows the NameNode to recover the filesystem to its last consistent state.

### Heartbeats and Block Reports
- **Heartbeat Frequency**: Typically sent every 3 seconds, heartbeats ensure the NameNode is aware of the operational status of each DataNode.
- **Block Reports Frequency**: Block reports are sent less frequently (typically every hour) and provide the NameNode with a complete inventory of the blocks stored on the DataNode.
- **Failure Detection**: If a DataNode fails to send a heartbeat within a specified timeout, the NameNode marks it as dead and triggers data replication to maintain the desired replication factor.

### Additional Considerations
- **Scaling and Performance**: HDFS is designed to scale horizontally, allowing for the addition of more DataNodes without significant changes to the existing infrastructure.
- **Client Interactions**: Clients interact with HDFS primarily through the NameNode to perform operations on the file system, such as reading or writing files. The actual data transfer occurs directly between clients and DataNodes, enhancing performance.
