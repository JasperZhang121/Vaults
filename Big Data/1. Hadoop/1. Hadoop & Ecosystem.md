1. **Introduction to Hadoop:**
    
    - Hadoop is an open-source framework designed for distributed storage and processing of large datasets across clusters of commodity hardware.
    - It provides a scalable and fault-tolerant solution for processing and analyzing vast amounts of data.
2. **Key Components of Hadoop:**
    
    - **Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS):** HDFS is a distributed file system that stores data across multiple machines in a cluster. It provides high-throughput access to large datasets.
    - **MapReduce:** MapReduce is a programming model and processing framework for distributed data processing in Hadoop. It enables parallel processing of data by dividing tasks into map and reduce phases.
    - **YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator):** YARN is the resource management layer of Hadoop. It allows multiple applications to run on the same cluster while efficiently managing resources.
3. **Advantages of Hadoop:**
    
    - **Scalability:** Hadoop can handle large-scale data processing by distributing the workload across multiple nodes in a cluster, making it highly scalable.
    - **Fault Tolerance:** Hadoop provides fault tolerance by automatically replicating data across multiple nodes. If a node fails, the data can still be accessed from other replicas.
    - **Cost-Effectiveness:** Hadoop utilizes commodity hardware, making it a cost-effective solution for storing and processing large datasets compared to traditional storage and processing systems.
    - **Flexibility:** Hadoop is flexible and can handle structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data, allowing organizations to work with diverse data types.
    - **Parallel Processing:** Hadoop's MapReduce model enables parallel processing of data, leading to faster data processing and analysis.
4. **Use Cases of Hadoop:**
    
    - **Batch Processing:** Hadoop is well-suited for batch processing tasks such as log analysis, data cleansing, and large-scale data transformations.
    - **Data Warehousing:** Hadoop can be used for building data warehouses that store and process large volumes of structured and semi-structured data for business intelligence and analytics.
    - **Data Lake:** Hadoop's ability to handle diverse data types makes it suitable for building data lakes that serve as a centralized repository for storing raw and processed data for analytics purposes.
    - **Machine Learning:** Hadoop can be integrated with machine learning frameworks to perform distributed training and processing of machine learning models on large datasets.
5. **Hadoop Ecosystem:**
    
    - Hadoop has a vast ecosystem of tools and technologies that extend its capabilities, including Apache Hive, Apache Pig, Apache Spark, Apache HBase, and Apache Kafka.
    - **Apache Hive:** Hive provides a SQL-like query language (HiveQL) for querying and analyzing data stored in Hadoop, making it easier for users familiar with SQL to work with Hadoop.
    - **Apache Pig:** Pig is a high-level data flow scripting language used for creating data pipelines and performing data transformations in Hadoop.
    - **Apache Spark:** Spark is a fast and general-purpose distributed computing system that provides in-memory data processing capabilities, making it suitable for real-time and iterative data processing tasks.

1. **Hadoop Ecosystem Overview**
    
    - **HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System)**
        - Namenode: Manages the directory tree structure, maintains metadata, and regulates access to files.
        - Datanode: Stores actual data, handles read/write requests, and performs block operations under Namenode's guidance.
        - Block: The minimum amount of data that HDFS can store or retrieve.
2. **MapReduce**
    
    - Job Tracker: Manages resource allocation and job scheduling, assigns tasks to nodes in the cluster.
    - Task Tracker: Executes tasks on behalf of the Job Tracker, processes data, and returns the result.
    - Map Task: Processes input data and produces intermediate <key, value> pairs.
    - Reduce Task: Merges all intermediate values associated with the same key.
3. **YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator)**
    
    - ResourceManager: Manages the use of resources across the cluster.
    - NodeManager: Manages the resource and task scheduling on a single node.
    - ApplicationMaster: Manages the lifecycle of a single application, requests resources from the ResourceManager, and works with the NodeManager to execute and monitor tasks.
4. **Other Components** (Brief mentions, as they are part of the broader Hadoop ecosystem)
    
    - **HBase**: A scalable, distributed database that supports structured data storage for large tables.
    - **Hive**: A data warehouse infrastructure that provides data summarization and ad hoc querying.
    - **Pig**: A high-level platform for creating MapReduce programs used with Hadoop.
    - **Sqoop**: A tool designed for efficiently transferring bulk data between Hadoop and structured datastores such as relational databases.
    - **Oozie**: A workflow scheduler system to manage Hadoop jobs.
5. **Core Concepts**
    
    - **Cluster**: A group of computers (nodes) that work together to perform distributed processing.
    - **Daemon**: A background process that supports the Hadoop ecosystem, such as the Namenode and Datanode for HDFS, and the JobTracker and TaskTracker for MapReduce.
    - **Job**: A unit of work that includes a MapReduce task or any other processing task that can be executed within the Hadoop ecosystem.
6. **Operations**
    
    - **Data Processing**: Data is split into blocks, processed in parallel using MapReduce tasks, and stored in HDFS.
    - **Resource Management**: YARN allocates system resources (CPU, memory) and schedules tasks to optimize cluster utilization.
    - **Fault Tolerance**: Data is replicated across multiple Datanodes to ensure availability in case of node failure.
