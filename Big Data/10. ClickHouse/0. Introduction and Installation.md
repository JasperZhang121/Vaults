ClickHouse is a columnar database management system (DBMS) developed by Yandex, Russia, and open-sourced in 2016. Written in C++, it is primarily used for Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) and allows SQL queries to generate real-time analytical reports.

#### OLAP and OLTP

- **OLAP (On-Line Analytical Processing):** Focuses on analytical processing and querying data in databases.
- **OLTP (On-Line Transaction Processing):** Focuses on transaction processing, involving operations like insert, update, and delete.

### Features

#### Columnar Storage

Using the following table as an example:

1. **Row-Oriented Storage:** Data is organized in rows on disk. This structure is efficient for fetching all attributes of a single entity but inefficient for querying specific attributes (e.g., retrieving ages).
    
2. **Columnar Storage:** Data is organized by columns on disk. This structure is efficient for retrieving specific attributes, such as ages, without scanning unnecessary data.
    
3. **Advantages of Columnar Storage:**
    
    - Superior for operations like aggregation, counting, and summation.
    - Easier to compress due to homogeneous data types in columns, leading to improved compression ratios.
    - Saves disk space and optimizes cache usage.

#### DBMS Features

- Supports most standard SQL syntax, including DDL and DML.
- Provides user and permission management, as well as data backup and recovery.

#### Diverse Engines

ClickHouse supports plugin-based table storage engines, similar to MySQL. Depending on requirements, different engines can be configured, including MergeTree, Log, and more (over 20 types).

#### High Throughput for Writes

- Utilizes an LSM Tree-like structure, appending data sequentially for high write throughput.
- Data segments are immutable post-write and undergo periodic compaction in the background.
- Achieves a write throughput of 50MB-200MB/s (approximately 500K-2M rows per second).

#### Partitioning and Thread-Level Parallelism

- Data is divided into multiple partitions, which are further divided into index granularities.
- Queries utilize all CPU cores on a machine, significantly reducing latency.
- Designed for parallel query execution, but not optimized for high QPS (queries per second).

### Installation

#### Preparation

1. **Disable Firewall**
    
2. **Remove File Descriptor Limits** Edit `/etc/security/limits.conf`:
    
    ```plaintext
    * soft nofile 65536
    * hard nofile 65536
    * soft nproc 131072
    * hard nproc 131072
    ```
    
    Restart and verify changes:
    
    ```bash
    ulimit -a
    ```
    
3. **Install Dependencies**
    
    ```bash
    sudo yum install -y libtool
    sudo yum install -y *unixODBC*
    ```
    
4. **Disable SELinux** Edit `/etc/selinux/config`:
    
    ```plaintext
    SELINUX=disabled
    ```
    
    Reboot the server.

#### Single-Node Installation

1. **Download Installation Packages** Obtain the following `.rpm` files:
    
    - `clickhouse-client-21.7.3.14-2.noarch.rpm`
    - `clickhouse-common-static-21.7.3.14-2.x86_64.rpm`
    - `clickhouse-common-static-dbg-21.7.3.14-2.x86_64.rpm`
    - `clickhouse-server-21.7.3.14-2.noarch.rpm`
    
    Use `wget` for downloading:
    
    ```bash
    wget https://repo.yandex.ru/clickhouse/rpm/stable/x86_64/clickhouse-client-21.7.3.14-2.noarch.rpm
    wget https://repo.yandex.ru/clickhouse/rpm/stable/x86_64/clickhouse-common-static-21.7.3.14-2.x86_64.rpm
    wget https://repo.yandex.ru/clickhouse/rpm/stable/x86_64/clickhouse-common-static-dbg-21.7.3.14-2.x86_64.rpm
    wget https://repo.yandex.ru/clickhouse/rpm/stable/x86_64/clickhouse-server-21.7.3.14-2.noarch.rpm
    ```
    
2. **Install Packages**
    
    ```bash
    sudo rpm -ivh *.rpm
    ```
    
3. **Modify Configuration** Edit `/etc/clickhouse-server/config.xml`:
    
    - Uncomment `<listen_host>0.0.0.0</listen_host>` to allow external access.
    - Default paths:
        - Data files: `/var/lib/clickhouse/`
        - Log files: `/var/log/clickhouse-server/clickhouse-server.log`
4. **Start the Server**
    
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl start clickhouse-server
    ```
    
    Check the status:
    
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl status clickhouse-server
    ```
    
5. **Connect to the Server**
    
    ```bash
    clickhouse-client -m
    ```
    
    If authentication fails, add the password:
    
    ```bash
    clickhouse-client -m --password
    ```
    

### Troubleshooting

1. **Error: `Connection refused (localhost:9000)`** Modify `<listen_host>::</listen_host>` to `<listen_host>0.0.0.0</listen_host>` in `config.xml`.
    
2. **Error: `Authentication failed`** Ensure you use the correct username and password in the client command.
