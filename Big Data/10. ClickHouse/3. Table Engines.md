### Usage of Table Engines

A table engine determines:

1. How data is stored and where it is read or written.
2. Supported queries and their execution methods.
3. Concurrent data access.
4. Index usage (if applicable).
5. Multithreaded request execution capability.
6. Data replication parameters.

The engine must be explicitly defined when creating a table, along with any parameters. Engine names are case-sensitive.

### Common Table Engines

#### **TinyLog**

- **Storage:** Columnar files on disk, no indexing or concurrency control.
- **Use Case:** Suitable for small tables with minimal data, mainly for testing and learning purposes.
- **Limitations:** Limited utility in production environments.

#### **Memory**

- **Storage:** Data is stored in memory in an uncompressed form. Data is lost upon server restart.
- **Performance:** Extremely high performance (>10GB/s) for simple queries, but lacks indexing.
- **Use Case:** Scenarios requiring ultra-high performance with small data volumes (up to ~100 million rows) or for testing.

#### **MergeTree (ðŸŒŸ)**

- **Overview:** The most powerful and widely used engine in ClickHouse. Supports indexing, partitioning, and advanced features. Equivalent to `InnoDB` in MySQL.

##### Basic SQL Syntax

1. **Table Creation:**
    
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE [IF NOT EXISTS] [db.]table_name [ON CLUSTER cluster]
    (
        column1 [type1] [DEFAULT|MATERIALIZED|ALIAS expr1] [TTL expr1],
        column2 [type2] [DEFAULT|MATERIALIZED|ALIAS expr2] [TTL expr2],
        ...
        INDEX index_name1 expr1 TYPE type1(...) GRANULARITY value1,
        INDEX index_name2 expr2 TYPE type2(...) GRANULARITY value2
    ) ENGINE = MergeTree()
    ORDER BY expr
    [PARTITION BY expr]
    [PRIMARY KEY expr]
    [SAMPLE BY expr]
    [TTL expr [DELETE|TO DISK 'xxx'|TO VOLUME 'xxx'], ...]
    [SETTINGS name=value, ...];
    ```
    
2. **Key Parameters:**
    
    - **`PARTITION BY`**: Defines partitioning rules (e.g., by date). Reduces query scope for better performance. Defaults to a single `all` partition if unspecified.
    - **`ORDER BY`**: Defines sorting rules within partitions. It is mandatory and determines the primary indexing order.
    - **`PRIMARY KEY`**: Specifies the primary index, which defaults to the `ORDER BY` fields. Unlike other databases, primary keys in ClickHouse allow duplicate values.
    - **`SAMPLE BY`**: Specifies sampling rules for queries.
    - **`SETTINGS`**:
        - `index_granularity`: Determines index granularity (default: 8192 rows).
        - `index_granularity_bytes`: Enables adaptive granularity in newer versions (default: 10MB).
3. **Example Table Creation:**
    
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE t_order_mt (
        id UInt32,
        sku_id String,
        total_amount Decimal(16,2),
        create_time DateTime
    ) ENGINE = MergeTree
    PARTITION BY toYYYYMMDD(create_time)
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
    ORDER BY (id, sku_id);
    ```
    
4. **Data Insertion:**
    
    ```sql
    INSERT INTO t_order_mt VALUES
    (101, 'sku_001', 1000.00, '2020-06-01 12:00:00'),
    (102, 'sku_002', 2000.00, '2020-06-01 11:00:00'),
    (102, 'sku_004', 2500.00, '2020-06-01 12:00:00'),
    (102, 'sku_002', 2000.00, '2020-06-01 13:00:00'),
    (102, 'sku_002', 12000.00, '2020-06-01 13:00:00'),
    (102, 'sku_002', 600.00, '2020-06-02 12:00:00');
    ```
    
5. **Querying Data:**
    
    - Data is partitioned by date (`2020-06-01`, `2020-06-02`) with duplicates allowed in primary keys.
    - Rows are ordered within partitions by `id` and `sku_id`.

#### Partitioning and Indexing

- **Partitioning:** Reduces the scope of queries by dividing data into logical groups. Useful for parallel processing.
- **Index Granularity:** Default is 8192 rows. Adaptive granularity can be enabled for more flexibility.

#### Key Indexing Concepts

- **Primary Index (`primary.idx`):** Sparse index optimized for reducing scan range. Defaults to `ORDER BY` fields.
- **Secondary Index:** Introduced in version 20.1.2.4. Allows faster filtering for non-primary key columns.
- **Indexing Levels:** Sparse indexing minimizes memory usage but requires scanning segments within granularity intervals.

### Advanced MergeTree Engines

#### **ReplacingMergeTree**

- Adds deduplication capabilities.
- Deduplication occurs during merges or inserts.
- Retains the record with the highest version or the last inserted record if versions are equal.

**Example:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE t_order_rmt (
    id UInt32,
    sku_id String,
    total_amount Decimal(16,2),
    create_time DateTime
) ENGINE = ReplacingMergeTree(create_time)
PARTITION BY toYYYYMMDD(create_time)
PRIMARY KEY (id)
ORDER BY (id, sku_id);
```

#### **SummingMergeTree**

- Pre-aggregates data for scenarios where only summary statistics are required.
- Aggregates numeric fields by default unless explicitly specified.

**Example:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE t_order_smt (
    id UInt32,
    sku_id String,
    total_amount Decimal(16,2),
    create_time DateTime
) ENGINE = SummingMergeTree(total_amount)
PARTITION BY toYYYYMMDD(create_time)
PRIMARY KEY (id)
ORDER BY (id, sku_id);
```

---

### Data Lifecycle Management (TTL)

- **Column-level TTL:** Replaces expired column values with default values. Deletes the column if all values are expired.
- **Table-level TTL:** Deletes rows or migrates partitions to specific disks/volumes after expiration.

**Example:**

```sql
ALTER TABLE t_order_mt3 MODIFY TTL create_time + INTERVAL 10 SECOND;
```

### Storage Details

1. **Columnar Storage:** Each column is stored independently in `.bin` files, enabling efficient compression and minimizing scans.
2. **Compression Blocks:** Data is organized into blocks of 64KBâ€“1MB, leveraging LZ4 or ZSTD compression.
3. **Data Marks:** Each `.bin` file has a corresponding `.mrk` file, storing offsets for efficient data retrieval.

**Key Benefits:**

- Optimized compression by grouping similar data.
- Minimizes data scanning during queries.
- Enhances query performance through parallelized access.
