### `if-else` Statement
```scala
if (condition) {
    // code block
} else if (condition) {
    // code block
} else {
    // code block
}
```
- In Scala, the `if-else` statement can have a return value, making it an expression. The return value is the result of the last executed statement.
- You can force the return type to be `Unit` to ignore the last expression's value, resulting in `()`.
- If there are multiple return types, the target variable's type must be specified as a common superclass, or it can be automatically inferred.
- Scala does not have a ternary conditional operator; use `if (a) b else c` instead of `a ? b : c`.
- Nested conditions work similarly.

### `for` Loop (For Comprehensions)
- Range iteration: `for(i <- 1 to 10) {}`, where `1 to 10` is a method call on `Int`, returning a `Range`.
- The range `1 to 10` includes the right boundary, while `1 until 10` excludes it. You can also use the `Range` class directly.
- Range with step: `1 to 10 by 2`.
- The range is a collection, so you can also iterate over regular collections: `for(i <- collection) {}`.
- Loop guard: A condition to filter elements, similar to `continue`.
    - Syntax:
    ```scala
    for (i <- collection if condition) {
        // code block
    }
    ```
    - Equivalent to:
    ```scala
    for (i <- collection) {
        if (condition) {
            // code block
        }
    }
    ```
- Nested loops can be combined into one `for` comprehension:
    - Standard syntax:
    ```scala
    for (i <- 1 to 4) {
        for (j <- 1 to 5) {
            println(s"i = $i, j = $j")
        }
    }
    ```
    - Equivalent syntax:
    ```scala
    for (i <- 1 to 4; j <- 1 to 5) {
        println(s"i = $i, j = $j")
    }
    ```
    - Example: Multiplication table
    ```scala
    for (i <- 1 to 9; j <- 1 to i) {
        print(s"$j * $i = ${i * j} \t")
        if (j == i) println()
    }
    ```
- Introducing variables in the loop:
    ```scala
    for (i <- 1 to 10; j = 10 - i) {
        println(s"i = $i, j = $j")
    }
    ```
- Using `{}` syntax for loops:
    - The above variable introduction example is equivalent to:
    ```scala
    for {
        i <- 1 to 10
        j = 10 - i
    } {
        println(s"i = $i, j = $j")
    }
    ```
- Loops can have return values, typically `Unit`, represented by `()`.
- Loops can also use `yield` to return a collection, pausing the loop, executing, and then continuing. Similar to Ruby/Python.
    ```scala
    val v = for (i <- 1 to 10) yield i * i // default implementation is Vector, Vector(1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100)
    ```

### `while` and `do while` Loops
- For Java compatibility; not recommended as they return `Unit`.
- Avoid using as they require variable declaration outside the loop, affecting external variables.
```scala
while (condition) {
    // code block
}

do {
    // code block
} while (condition)
```

### Loop Control
- Scala does not include `break` and `continue` keywords. Instead, use functional programming techniques.
- Use `breakable` structure to implement `break` and `continue`.
- Loop guards can replace `continue` to some extent.
- You can exit a loop by throwing and catching an exception to replace `break`.
    ```scala
    try {
        for (i <- 0 to 10) {
            if (i == 3)
                throw new RuntimeException
            println(i)
        }
    } catch {
        case _: Exception => // do nothing
    }
    ```
- Use Scala's `Breaks` class for the `break` method (which internally uses exception handling).
    ```scala
    import scala.util.control.Breaks

    Breaks.breakable {
        for (i <- 0 to 10) {
            if (i == 3)
                Breaks.break()
            println(i)
        }
    }
    ```
