### Comments
- Similar to Java
- `//` for single-line comments
- `/* */` for multi-line comments
- `/** */` for documentation comments before methods or classes, useful for generating documentation with `scaladoc`.

### Variables and Constants
```scala
var name [:VariableType] = value // variable
val name [:ConstantType] = value // constant
```
In Scala, due to its functional programming elements, it is generally advised to use constants over variables whenever possible.
- The type can be omitted during declaration, as the compiler can infer it.
- Scala is statically typed, and once the type is determined, it cannot be changed.
- Variables and constants must have initial values upon declaration.
- Variables are mutable, while constants are immutable.
- For reference type constants, you can change the fields of the object but not the reference itself.
- No need to end statements with `;` as Scala automatically recognizes the end of a statement.

### Identifier Naming Conventions
- Can start with a letter or underscore, followed by letters, digits, or underscores, similar to C/C++/Java.
- Can start with an operator and only contain operators (e.g., +-*/#!), making operator overloading very flexible.
- Can use any string enclosed in backticks, even if it matches one of the 39 Scala keywords.
  
```scala
var _abc: String = "hello"
val -+/%# = 10
val `if` = 10
println(_abc)
println(-+/%#)
println(`if`)
```

### Keywords
- `package`, `import`, `class`, `object`, `trait`, `extends`, `with`, `type`, `for`
- `private`, `protected`, `abstract`, `sealed`, `final`, `implicit`, `lazy`, `override`
- `try`, `catch`, `finally`, `throw`
- `if`, `else`, `match`, `case`, `do`, `while`, `for`, `return`, `yield`
- `def`, `var`, `val`
- `this`, `super`
- `new`
- `true`, `false`, `null`
- Keywords not in Java: `object`, `trait`, `with`, `implicit`, `match`, `yield`, `def`, `val`, `var`

### Strings
- Type: `String`
- Concatenation with `+`
- String multiplication with `*` to repeat a string multiple times
- Formatted output with `printf`
- String interpolation with `s"xxx${varname}"`, formatted string interpolation with `f"xxx${varname}%format"`, and raw strings with `raw"rawstringcontents${var}"`
- Multi-line strings with `""" """`
- Output with `print`, `printf`, `println`
  
```scala
val name: String = "Pyrrha" + " " + "Nikos"
val age = 17
println((name + " ") * 3)
printf("%s : dead in %d\n", name, age)
print(s"$name : dead in ${age}")
val power = 98.9072
println(f" : power ${power}%.2f.")

val sql = s"""
    |Select *
    |from 
    |   Student
    |Where
    |   name = ${name}
    |and
    |   age >= ${age}
""".stripMargin // strip | and whitespaces before |
println(sql)
```

### Input
- `StdIn.readLine()`
- `StdIn.readShort()`, `StdIn.readDouble`
- `import scala.io.StdIn`
  
```scala
println("input name:")
val name: String = StdIn.readLine()
println("input age:")
val age: Int = StdIn.readInt()
println(name + " : " + age)
```

### File I/O
```scala
import scala.io.Source
import java.io.PrintWriter
import java.io.File

object FileIO {
    def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
        // read from file
        Source.fromFile("FileIO.txt").foreach(print)

        // write to file
        val writer = new PrintWriter(new File("WFile.txt"))
        writer.write("Nephren!")
        writer.close()
    }
}
```

### Data Types
- Java primitive types: `char`, `byte`, `short`, `int`, `long`, `float`, `double`, `boolean`.
- Java wrapper types: `Character`, `Byte`, `Short`, `Integer`, `Long`, `Float`, `Double`, `Boolean`.
- Scala is purely object-oriented, all data are objects, and all are subclasses of `Any`.
- `Any` has two subclasses: `AnyVal` (value types) and `AnyRef` (reference types).
- Numeric types are subclasses of `AnyVal`. The main difference with Java is that `Int` and `Char` are the default integer and character types.
- `StringOps` enhances the Java `String` class and is a subclass of `AnyVal`.
- `Unit` corresponds to `void` in Java and is a subclass of `AnyVal`. It represents a method with no return value and has a single instance, represented as `()`.
- `Null` is a type with a single instance `null`, representing a null reference. It is mainly used for interoperability with other JVM languages and is rarely used in Scala.
- `Nothing` is a subtype of all types and is used to indicate abnormal termination, such as throwing an exception or an infinite loop.

#### Integer Types
All integers are signed and use standard two's complement representation.
- `Byte`: 1 byte
- `Short`: 2 bytes
- `Int`: 4 bytes
- `Long`: 8 bytes
- Exceeding the range of an integer type will cause an error.
- The default type for integer literals is `Int`. Use the suffix `L` for `Long`.

#### Floating Point Types
- `Float`: IEEE 754 32-bit floating point
- `Double`: IEEE 754 64-bit floating point
- The default type for floating point literals is `Double`.

#### Character Type
- Similar to Java's `Character`, 2 bytes, UTF-16 encoded.
- Character literals are enclosed in single quotes: `'a'`.
- Type: `Char`
- Escape sequences: `\t`, `\n`, `\r`, `\\`, `\"`, `\'`, etc.

#### Boolean Type
- `true` and `false`

#### Empty Types
- `Unit`: Represents no value, only has one instance. Used for functions with no return value.
- `Null`: Only has one instance, `null`, representing a null reference.
- `Nothing`: Used to indicate no normal return value, such as when throwing an exception.

```scala
object NullType {
    def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
        // Unit
        def f1(): Unit = {
            println("just nothing!")
        }
        val a = f1()
        println(a) // ()

        // null only used for AnyRef
        // val n: Int = null // invalid
    }
}
```

### Type Conversion
- Automatic type promotion: Mixed-type operations will promote types to the highest precision type.
- Assigning a higher precision type to a lower precision type will cause an error.
- All conversions not covered by implicit type promotion require explicit conversion.
- `Byte`, `Short`, and `Char` are promoted to `Int` during operations.
- `Boolean` cannot be used in numeric operations and cannot be implicitly converted to an integer.


### Explicit Type Conversion
- Methods: `toByte`, `toInt`, `toChar`, etc.
- Examples: `'a'.toInt`, `2.7.toInt`
- Converting between numbers and strings: `"" + n`, `"100".toInt`, `"12.3".toFloat`, `"12.3".toDouble.toInt`
- Direct conversion may fail; explicit conversion is needed: `(a + 10).toByte`

### Scala Standard Library
- Types like `Int`, `Double`, etc., correspond to Java's primitive types but are not objects at runtime. Scala provides implicit conversions to rich types like `scala.runtime.RichInt` and `scala.runtime.RichDouble` for object-like operations.
- Basic types are automatically imported from the `scala` package, including the `scala.Predef` object.
- Other packages:
  - `scala.collection`: Collections.
  - `scala.collection.immutable`: Immutable data structures like arrays, lists, ranges, hash tables, and hash sets.
  - `scala.collection.mutable`: Mutable data structures like array buffers, string builders, hash tables, and hash sets.
  - `scala.collection.concurrent`: Mutable concurrent data structures like tries.
- `scala.concurrent`: Primitive concurrency programming.
- `scala.io`: Input and output operations.
- `scala.math`: Basic mathematical operations.
- `scala.sys`: Interactions with the operating system.
- `scala.util.matching`: Regular expressions.
- Additional standard library components may be in separate libraries and require separate installation, including:
  - `scala.reflect`: Reflection API.
  - `scala.xml`: XML parsing, manipulation, and serialization.
  - `scala.collection.parallel`: Parallel collections.
  - `scala.util.parsing`: Combinator parsers.
  - `scala.swing`: A wrapper for Java's Swing GUI framework.
- Common aliases for frequently used classes, like `List` for `scala.collection.immutable.List`, are default imports.
- Some aliases are provided by the underlying platform, such as `String` being an alias for `java.lang.String`.
