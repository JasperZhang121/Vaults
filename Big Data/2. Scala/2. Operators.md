### Overview
- Mostly similar to Java.
- Arithmetic operators: `+ - * / %`. The `+` operator can be used for unary positive, binary addition, and string concatenation. The modulus operator `%` can also be used with floating-point numbers. There are no increment and decrement operators (`++ --`).
- Relational operators: `== != < > <= >=`
- Logical operators: `&& || !`, with short-circuit evaluation supported.
- Assignment operators: `= += -= *= /= %=`
- Bitwise operators: `& | ^ ~`
- Shift operators: `<< >> >>>`, where `<< >>` are signed left and right shifts, and `>>>` is an unsigned right shift.
- In Scala, all operators are essentially methods of objects, allowing for more flexible operator overloading than in C++.

### Custom Operators
- In Scala, operators are methods, and any method with a single parameter can be used as an **infix operator**. For example, `10.+(1)` is equivalent to `10 + 1`.
- You can define custom operators by using valid operator characters (only special symbols) as function names.

### Operator Precedence
- When an expression uses multiple operators, the **precedence is determined by the first character of the operator**. Both built-in and custom operators follow the same precedence rules.

Operator precedence (from highest to lowest):

```scala
* / %
+ -
:
= !
< >
&
^
|
(all letters, $, _)
```

- For example, the following two expressions are equivalent:

```scala
a + b ^? c ?^ d less a ==> b | c
((a + b) ^? (c ?^ d)) less ((a ==> b) | c)
```

### Prefix, Infix, and Postfix Operations

#### Prefix Operations
- Only `+ - ! ~` are valid prefix operators, representing positive, negative, logical negation, and bitwise negation respectively.
- Prefix operators are equivalent to method calls without arguments: `.+() .-() .!() .~()`
- Prefix operators have a higher priority, and the operand is considered atomic. For example, `-sin(x)` is parsed as `-(sin(x))`.

#### Postfix Operations
- Postfix operators can be any identifier. All `e op` expressions are interpreted as `e.op`.

#### Infix Operations
- Any identifier can be used as an infix operator.
- Infix operators' precedence is defined by the first character of the operator, in ascending order:

```scala
(all letters, $, _)
|
^
&
= !
< >
:
+ -
* / %
(other operator characters)
```

- Associativity is determined by the last character of the operator. Operators ending in `:` are right-associative; others are left-associative.
- Operator precedence and associativity determine the meaning of an expression, i.e., its structure.

Example for multiple infix operators:
- Higher precedence operators bind more closely to their operands.
- For multiple consecutive operators of the same precedence, associativity is used to determine the binding, with left-associative operators binding from left to right, and right-associative operators binding from right to left.
- Postfix operators always have lower precedence than infix operators. For example, `e1 op1 e2 op2` is interpreted as `(e1 op1 e2) op2`.

### Assignment Operators
- Assignment operators are those ending with `=` (except `>= <= !=`).
- They are treated specially when other interpretations are invalid. For instance, `l += r` is interpreted as `l = l + r` if `l` does not have a `+=` operator and `l + r` is type-correct.

### Custom Operator Examples
```scala
import scala.language.postfixOps

object UserDefinedOps {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    val v = Vector2(10, 5)
    val v2 = Vector2(5, 10)

    println(v)
    // prefix unary
    println("==========================================")
    println(+v)
    println(-v)
    println(v.unary_-("hello"))

    // binary
    println("==========================================")
    println(v * 3)
    println(v * v2)
    println(v + v2)
    println(v - v2)
    
    // postfix unary, just for test, no meaning
    println("==========================================")
    println(v-)
    println((v-)-)

    // multiple
    println("==========================================")
    println(v hello ("test", "yes"))
    println(v + (10, 10))
    println(v - (10, 10))

    // assignment operator
    println("==========================================")
    var v3 = Vector2(10, 5)
    println(v3 *= 3) // ()
    println(v3) // Vector2(30.0, 15.0)
    v3 /= 3
    println(v3)
    v3 += v2
    println(v3)
    v3 += (10, 10)
    println(v3)
  }
}

class Vector2(val x: Double, val y: Double) {
  override def toString(): String = s"Vector2($x, $y)"
  
  // prefix unary
  def unary_- = this.- // call postfix -
  def unary_+ = Vector2(x, y)
  def unary_-(str: String) = s"unary - with a string parameter: $str" // cannot call this through operator format
  
  // binary
  def +(v: Vector2) = Vector2(x + v.x, y + v.y)
  def -(v: Vector2) = Vector2(x - v.x, y - v.y)
  def *(v: Vector2) = x * v.x + y * v.y // Inner product 
  def *(d: Double) = Vector2(d * x, d * y) // multiply
  def /(d: Double) = Vector2(x / d, y / d)
  
  // postfix unary
  def - = Vector2(-x, -y)
  
  // multiple
  def hello(a: String, b: String) = s"$a, $b, ${toString()}"
  def +(_x: Double, _y: Double): Vector2 = this + Vector2(_x, _y)
  def -(_x: Double, _y: Double): Vector2 = Vector2(x - _x, y - _y)
}

object Vector2 {
  def apply(x: Double, y: Double) = new Vector2(x, y)
}
```

### Practice Guidelines
- Define prefix and postfix unary operators without parameter lists, using operator format.
- Use parentheses in complex expressions to clarify priority.
- Define binary operators with a single parameter, using operator format.
- Avoid using operator format for methods with more than one parameter, unless clear.
- Functions can also be operators, providing strong expressiveness (e.g., `1 to 10`).
- Avoid overuse to prevent confusion about which are operators and which are operands.
- More practice is needed for deeper understanding.
