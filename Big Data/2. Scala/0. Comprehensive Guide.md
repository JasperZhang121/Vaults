### Scala

Scala (/ˈskɑːlə, ˈskeɪlə/) is a multi-paradigm programming language designed to integrate features of <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">object-oriented and functional programming</mark>. It was designed by Martin Odersky at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in 2001, based on his previous work on Funnel. Scala for the Java platform was released in late 2003/early 2004.

### Features

- Runs on the JVM and can coexist with existing programs.
- Directly uses Java libraries.
- Statically typed, similar to Java.
- Syntax is similar to Java but more concise and expressive.
- Supports both object-oriented and functional programming.
- More object-oriented than Java.

### Focus Areas

- Type inference, immutability, functional programming, advanced program constructs.
- Concurrency: actor model.
- Interoperability with existing Java code, comparisons, and trade-offs with Java.

### Relationship with Java

```
        javac               java
.java --------> .class ----------> run on JVM
.scala -------> .class ----------> run on JVM
        scalac              scala
```

### Environment Setup

Scala requires Java. Visit [this link](https://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/jdk-compatibility/overview.html) to check the Java version compatibility for specific Scala versions.

### Windows Installation

1. Download and install Scala.
2. Configure environment variables similar to Java:
   - Set `SCALA_HOME` to the installation directory.
   - Add `%SCALA_HOME%\bin` to the `PATH` environment variable.

### Linux Installation

1. Use package managers or download the specific version if strict version matching is required.
2. Set up environment variables similarly.

### Interactive Shell

Start the Scala interactive shell:

```
scala
```

Traditional "Hello, World!" in the interactive environment:

```scala
println("hello, world!")
```

### Single File Compilation and Execution

For simplicity, focus on single file compilation and execution. For project development, organize code in packages using IntelliJ IDEA with Maven or SBT.

In VSCode, install the Scala Syntax (official) and Scala (Metals) plugins.

Create a file `HelloScala.scala`:

```scala
object HelloScala {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    println("hello, world!")
  }
}
```

Run the code with the CodeRunner plugin or compile and run from the command line:

```
scalac HelloScala.scala
scala HelloScala
```

Or directly run the Scala source file:

```
scala HelloScala.scala
```

If compiled, two `.class` files (`HelloScala.class` and `HelloScala$.class`) are generated. To run the bytecode:

```
java -cp %SCALA_HOME%/lib/scala-library.jar; HelloScala
```

Use [Java Decompiler](http://java-decompiler.github.io/) to decompile bytecode to Java source.

## IntelliJ IDEA Setup

1. Create a Maven project with JDK 17.
2. Install the Scala plugin (usually pre-installed).
3. Create a `scala/` directory under `main/` and mark it as Source Root.
4. Add Scala SDK and create Scala source files.

Example:

```scala
package VeryStarted

object HelloWorld {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    println("Hello, world!")
  }
}
```

Run with Ctrl + Shift + F10. Java classes can be called from Scala:

```scala
package VeryStarted

object HelloWorld {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    println("Hello, world!")
    System.out.println("Hello, world! from Java")
  }
}
```

### Syntax

```scala
object SingletonObject { body }
def MethodName(ArgName: ArgType): RetType = { body }
```

`object` keyword creates a singleton object, replacing Java's `static` keyword with instance methods in a pure object-oriented approach.

### Example Comparison: Java vs. Scala

**Java:**

```java
public class Student {
    private String name;
    private Integer age;
    private static String school = "XDU";

    public Student(String name, Integer age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    public void printInfo() {
        System.out.println(this.name + " " + this.age + " " + Student.school);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Student student = new Student("John", 20);
        student.printInfo();
    }
}
```

**Scala:**

```scala
package VeryStarted

class Student(name: String, age: Int) {
  def printInfo(): Unit = {
    println(name + " " + age + " " + Student.school)
  }
}

object Student {
  val school: String = "XDU"

  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    val student = new Student("John", 20)
    student.printInfo()
  }
}
```

### Scala Library Source and API Documentation

1. Download Scala source from the official website and extract it.
2. Attach the source in IntelliJ IDEA for browsing.
3. Access the documentation bundled with the installation or download separately.

Scala relies on Java, with some types being Java wrappers.
