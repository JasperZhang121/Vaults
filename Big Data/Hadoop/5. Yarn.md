YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator) is a core component of Hadoop 2.0 that allows for the management of computing resources in clusters and uses them for scheduling users' applications. Before YARN, Hadoop's MapReduce framework handled both the computation and the resource management aspects of data processing, which was less efficient and flexible. YARN was introduced to overcome these limitations, providing a more dynamic, scalable, and efficient way to manage resources across the Hadoop ecosystem.

#### Key Components of YARN

- **ResourceManager (RM):** The master that arbitrates all the available cluster resources. It has two main components: the Scheduler and the ApplicationsManager. The Scheduler is responsible for allocating resources to the various running applications, while the ApplicationsManager manages the lifecycle of applications submitted to YARN.
  
- **NodeManager (NM):** The per-machine agent who is responsible for containers, monitoring their resource usage (cpu, memory, disk, network) and reporting the same to the ResourceManager.

- **ApplicationMaster (AM):** An instance of a framework-specific library that negotiates resources from the ResourceManager and works with the NodeManager(s) to execute and monitor the tasks.

#### YARN Workflow

1. **Application Submission:** An application is submitted to the ResourceManager, which initiates the ApplicationMaster.
2. **Resource Negotiation:** The ApplicationMaster negotiates resources with the ResourceManager to execute its tasks.
3. **Task Execution:** Once resources are granted, the ApplicationMaster works with NodeManagers to start containers and execute tasks.
4. **Monitoring and Reporting:** The ApplicationMaster monitors the task's progress and reports back to the ResourceManager. Upon completion, resources are released back to the cluster.
