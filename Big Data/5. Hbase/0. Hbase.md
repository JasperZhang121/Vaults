### Definition
HBase is a distributed, <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">scalable NoSQL database</mark> designed for storing large amounts of data. It is based on Google's Bigtable design and runs on top of Hadoop HDFS, offering efficient random read and write capabilities while supporting operations on large datasets.

### Data Model
Logically, HBase's data model is similar to that of a relational database, where data is stored in a table with rows and columns. However, from the perspective of HBase's underlying <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">physical storage structure (Key-Value)</mark>, HBase resembles a multi-dimensional map.

### Physical Storage Structure
HBase's physical storage structure relies on HDFS. Each table is divided into multiple regions, with <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">each region storing a subset of the table</mark>. A RegionServer is responsible for managing multiple regions. Data is stored in HFiles by column families, and these HFiles are stored on HDFS.

### Data Model

#### 1. Namespace
A namespace is similar to a <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">database concept</mark> in relational databases, containing multiple tables. HBase has two built-in namespaces: `hbase` and `default`. The `hbase` namespace stores HBase's built-in tables, while `default` is the default namespace for user tables.

#### 2. Table
Similar to the concept of tables in relational databases. However, when defining a table in HBase, you only need to declare <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">column families</mark>, not specific columns. This means that when writing data to HBase, fields can be dynamically specified as needed. Thus, compared to relational databases, HBase can easily handle schema changes.

#### 3. Row
Each row in an HBase table is composed of a RowKey and multiple columns. Data is stored in the dictionary order of the RowKey, and data retrieval can only be done based on the RowKey, making the design of the RowKey crucial.

#### 4. Column Family and Column
Each column in HBase is defined by a Column Family and a Column Qualifier, for example, `info:name`, `info:age`. When creating a table, only the column family needs to be specified; column qualifiers do not need to be pre-defined. Column families are the basic unit of storage, and data from different column families is stored separately, each with independent storage and retrieval mechanisms.

#### 5. Timestamp
Used to identify different versions of data, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">each data entry is given a timestamp</mark> when written to HBase if not specified. This timestamp is the time when the data is written to HBase. This allows HBase to store multiple versions of the same cell.

#### 6. Cell
A cell is uniquely identified by `{rowkey, column family:column qualifier, timestamp}`. The data within a cell is stored in bytecode format without any specific type.

### Features of HBase
1. **Linear Scalability**: HBase achieves linear scalability by adding more RegionServers, enhancing data storage and processing capacity.
2. **Strong Consistency**: HBase guarantees strong consistency for operations on a single row.
3. **Automatic Partitioning**: HBase automatically partitions data into different regions, each composed of one or more HFiles.
4. **High Availability**: HBase provides high availability through HDFS's replication mechanism and HBase's RegionServer fault tolerance.

### Use Cases for HBase
1. **Real-time Read/Write**: HBase is suitable for applications requiring fast write and random read capabilities, such as log processing and <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">real-time data analysis</mark>.
2. **Big Data Storage**: HBase can store vast amounts of structured and unstructured data, making it suitable for applications needing to store petabyte-scale data.
3. **Data Versioning**: HBase supports multiple versions of data, making it ideal for use cases requiring tracking of data history changes.
