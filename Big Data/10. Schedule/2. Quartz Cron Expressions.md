Quartz cron expressions are similar to Unix/Linux cron expressions but have a few key differences and additional features that make them more versatile. They are used within the Quartz Scheduler to schedule jobs. A Quartz cron expression is a string composed of six or seven fields, each representing a time unit or a special character specifying repeating intervals.

### Format of a Quartz Cron Expression

A Quartz cron expression has the following format:

```
second minute hour day_of_month month day_of_week [year]
```

1. **Second** (0 - 59)
2. **Minute** (0 - 59)
3. **Hour** (0 - 23)
4. **Day of the month** (1 - 31)
5. **Month** (1 - 12 or JAN-DEC)
6. **Day of the week** (1 - 7 or SUN-SAT, where 1 is Sunday)
7. **Year** (optional field)

### Special Characters in Quartz

- **Asterisk (*)**: Represents all possible values for a field. For example, `*` in the minute field means "every minute."
- **Question Mark (?)**: Used to specify no specific value and is allowed in the day_of_month and day_of_week fields. It is useful when you need to specify something in one of these fields but not the other.
- **Hyphen (-)**: Indicates a range of values, such as `10-12` in the hour field to trigger an event from 10 AM to 12 PM.
- **Comma (,)**: Lists additional values. For instance, `MON,WED,FRI` in the day_of_week field means "on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday."
- **Slash (/)**: Specifies increments. `0/15` in the seconds field means "at seconds 0, 15, 30, and 45 of each minute."
- **L**: Stands for "last," but its meaning can vary based on the field. For example, `L` in the day_of_month field means "the last day of the month."
- **W**: Represents the nearest weekday to a given day in the month. For example, `15W` is interpreted as "the nearest weekday to the 15th of the month."
