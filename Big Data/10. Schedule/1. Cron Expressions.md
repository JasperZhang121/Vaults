Cron expressions are strings that represent a schedule in a time-based job-scheduling system. They are typically used in Unix-like operating systems to automate the execution of scripts, commands, or software. A cron expression is composed of five or six fields separated by space, each representing a unit of time.

### Format of a Cron Expression

A cron expression consists of the following fields:

```
* * * * * [command to execute]
```

1. **Minute** (0 - 59)
2. **Hour** (0 - 23)
3. **Day of the month** (1 - 31)
4. **Month** (1 - 12 or JAN-DEC)
5. **Day of the week** (0 - 6 or SUN-SAT)
6. **Command to execute** (optional in some systems)

Each field can contain a value, a wildcard (`*`), a range (e.g., `1-3`), a list (e.g., `1,2,3`), or a step value (e.g., `*/2`).

### Special Characters

- **Asterisk (*)**: Represents "every" time unit. For example, `*` in the minute field means "every minute."
- **Comma (,)**: Specifies a list of values. For example, `1,3,5` in the day-of-week field means "every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday."
- **Hyphen (-)**: Defines a range of values. For example, `10-12` in the hour field means "10 AM, 11 AM, and 12 PM."
- **Slash (/)**: Specifies increments. For example, `*/10` in the minute field means "every 10 minutes."
