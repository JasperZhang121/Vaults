### Deployment Modes in Flink

Flink supports multiple deployment modes tailored for different environments and use cases:

- **Local Mode**:  
  Runs Flink on a single machine for quick experimentation or debugging. It is rarely used in production.
  
- **Standalone Mode**:  
  Deploys Flink using its built-in cluster manager. Commonly used for development and testing environments where Hadoop YARN is not available.
  
- **YARN Mode**:  
  Utilizes Hadoop YARN for resource management, ensuring effective utilization of cluster resources. This mode is preferred in enterprise production environments where multiple workloads coexist on the same cluster.

> **Note:** For installation guidelines, refer to the official documentation or community resources.


### Flink on YARN Deployment Architecture

The deployment of Flink on YARN involves the following steps:

1. **YARN Client Initialization**:
   - Fetches Hadoop configuration using environment variables: `YARN_CONF_DIR`, `HADOOP_CONF_DIR`, or `HADOOP_CONF_PATH`.
   - Defaults to `$HADOOP_HOME/etc/hadoop` if the above variables are not set.

2. **Resource Request and Preparation**:
   - The client verifies resource availability (e.g., CPU, memory).
   - Configuration files (e.g., HDFS and Flink-specific settings) and Flink JARs are uploaded to HDFS.

3. **Application Launch**:
   - The client sends a request to YARN's `ResourceManager` to start an application.
   - `ResourceManager` coordinates with `NodeManagers` to provision containers and download necessary files.

4. **Application Master (AM) Initialization**:
   - The `ApplicationMaster` launches the `JobManager`.
   - JobManagerâ€™s address is written to HDFS for later use.

5. **TaskManager Provisioning**:
   - The `ApplicationMaster` requests additional containers for TaskManagers.
   - TaskManagers download the JARs and configuration files from HDFS.

6. **Execution and Monitoring**:
   - TaskManagers execute tasks and report status to the JobManager.
   - `ApplicationMaster` manages task states, including restarting failed tasks.

7. **Job Completion**:
   - Upon task completion, the `ApplicationMaster` deregisters with the `ResourceManager` and shuts down.


### Preparing for Cluster Startup

1. **Modify Hadoop Configuration**:
   - Edit `etc/hadoop/yarn-site.xml` to <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">disable strict virtual memory checks</mark>:
     ```xml
     <property>
         <name>yarn.nodemanager.vmem-check-enabled</name>
         <value>false</value>
     </property>
     ```
     This setting prevents tasks from being killed if they exceed memory limits.

2. **Update Environment Variables**:
   - Add the following to `/etc/profile`:
     ```bash
     export HADOOP_CONF_DIR=/export/servers/hadoop/etc/hadoop
     ```
     Ensure `YARN_CONF_DIR` or `HADOOP_CONF_DIR` is correctly set for accessing YARN and HDFS configurations.

3. **Start Required Services**:
   - Start HDFS, Zookeeper (if applicable), and the YARN cluster.

4. **Submit Jobs**:
   - Use the YARN session or cluster mode (explained below) to submit Flink jobs.


### YARN Deployment Modes

Flink on YARN supports two primary modes of operation:

#### **1. YARN Session Mode**

- **Overview**:  
  A persistent session is established where `JobManager` and `TaskManager` remain active to accept jobs continuously. Best suited for small, frequent jobs.

- **Starting a YARN Session**:
  ```bash
  bin/yarn-session.sh -n 2 -tm 800 -jm 800 -s 1 -d
  ```
  - `-n`: Number of containers.
  - `-tm`: Memory allocated per TaskManager (in MB).
  - `-jm`: Memory allocated to the JobManager (in MB).
  - `-s`: Task slots per container.
  - `-d`: Runs the session in the background.

- **Submitting a Job**:
  ```bash
  bin/flink run examples/batch/WordCount.jar
  ```

- **Terminating the Session**:
  ```bash
  yarn application -kill application_id
  ```

#### **2. YARN Cluster Mode**

- **Overview**:  
  A job is directly submitted to YARN, and resources are allocated dynamically. The session terminates once the job is completed. Ideal for larger, resource-intensive jobs.

- **Submitting a Job**:
  ```bash
  bin/flink run -m yarn-cluster -yn 2 -yjm 800 -ytm 800 /path/to/WordCount.jar
  ```
  - `-yn`: Number of TaskManagers.
  - `-yjm`: Memory allocated to the JobManager (in MB).
  - `-ytm`: Memory allocated to each TaskManager (in MB).

- **Dynamic Property Configuration**:
  Use `-D` to override specific configurations temporarily:
  ```bash
  -Dfs.overwrite-files=true -Dtaskmanager.network.numberOfBuffers=16368
  ```

### Switching Deployment Modes

To switch from YARN session mode to standalone mode:

1. Delete the `/tmp/.yarn-properties-root` file, which contains session details from the previous YARN session.
2. Start the standalone cluster or configure for another mode as needed.
