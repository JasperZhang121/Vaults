### Data Management

Data Management is the planning, policy-setting, regulation, and practice activities conducted throughout the entire lifecycle of data and information assets to deliver, control, protect, and enhance their value. The process includes execution and supervision.

The responsibility of managing data must be jointly assumed by both business personnel and IT personnel. These two fields need to collaborate to ensure that the organization possesses high-quality data that meets strategic needs.

The main driver of data management is to enable organizations to derive value from their data assets.

### Goals of organizational data management include:

1. Understanding and supporting the information needs of the business and its stakeholders (including customers, employees, and business partners).
2. Acquiring, storing, protecting data, and ensuring the integrity of data assets.
3. Ensuring the quality of data and information.
4. Ensuring the privacy and confidentiality of stakeholder data.
5. Preventing unauthorized or improper access, manipulation, and use of data and information.
6. Ensuring data effectively serves the goal of business value addition.

Data is both an interpretation of the object it represents and an object that requires interpretation.

Recognizing the need to prepare data and information for different purposes will form a core principle of data management: both data and information need to be managed. When the use of both and the needs of customers are managed together, the quality should be higher.

An asset is an economic resource that can be owned or controlled, held, or create value. Assets can be converted into money.

Many organizations define themselves as "data-driven." To maintain competitiveness, businesses must stop making decisions based on intuition or feeling and instead use event triggers and applied analytics to gain actionable insights.

### Data Management Principles

Data management shares common characteristics with other forms of asset management, as illustrated in Figure 1-1. It involves understanding what data an organization has and what can be accomplished with it, then determining the best way to utilize data assets to achieve organizational goals. Like other management processes, data management must balance strategic and operational needs. This balance is best followed by a set of principles that guide data management practices.

#### (1) Data is an Asset with Unique Properties

Data is an asset, but it differs from other assets in some aspects of its management. Unlike financial and physical assets, data assets do not deplete through use.

#### (2) The Value of Data can be Expressed in Economic Terms

Calling data an asset implies it has value. While there are technical means to measure the quantity and quality of data, no standards have yet been established to measure its value. Organizations wishing to make better decisions about their data should develop consistent methods to quantify that value. They should also measure the costs of low-quality data and the benefits of high-quality data.

#### (3) Managing Data Means Managing Data Quality

Ensuring that data meets the requirements of its applications is the primary goal of data management. To manage quality, organizations must understand stakeholders' quality requirements and measure data accordingly.

#### (4) Managing Data Requires Metadata

Managing any asset first requires having data about that asset (e.g., number of employees, account numbers). Data used for managing and how data is used are called metadata. Because data cannot be physically handled or touched, understanding what it is and how to use it requires defining this knowledge in the form of metadata. Metadata arises from a variety of processes related to data creation, processing, and use, including architecture, modeling, management, governance, data quality management, system development, IT, business operations, and analytics.

#### (5) Data Management Requires Planning

Even small organizations may have complex blueprints for technology and business processes. Data is created in multiple places and needs to move among many storage locations due to usage, thus requiring coordination to maintain consistency. This needs planning from an architectural and process perspective.

#### (6) Data Management Must Drive IT Decisions

Data and data management are closely integrated with information technology and IT management. Managing data requires a method to ensure technology serves rather than drives the organization's strategic data.

#### (7) Data Management is a Cross-Functional Job

Data management requires a range of skills and expertise, so no single team can manage all an organization's data. Data management needs technical ability, non-technical skills, and collaboration capabilities.

#### (8) Data Management Requires an Enterprise Perspective

While there are many specialized applications for data management, it must be effectively applied across the entire enterprise. This is one reason why data management and data governance are intertwined.

#### (9) Data Management Requires Multi-faceted Thinking

Data is fluid, and data management must continuously evolve to keep up with the ways data is created, applied, and changed by consumers.

#### (10) Data Management Requires Full Lifecycle Management, Different Types of Data Have Different Lifecycle Characteristics

Data has a lifecycle, thus data management needs to manage its lifecycle. Because data generates more data, the data lifecycle itself can be quite complex. Data management practices need to consider the entire lifecycle of data. Different types of data have different lifecycle characteristics, thus they have different management needs. Data management practices need to maintain sufficient flexibility to meet the lifecycle needs of different types of data.

#### (11) Data Management Must Include Risks Related to Data

Data is not only an asset but also represents organizational risk. Data can be lost, stolen, or misused. Organizations must consider the ethical implications of using data. Data-related risks must be managed as part of the data lifecycle.

#### (12) Effective Data Management Requires Leadership Commitment

Data management involves complex processes that require coordination, collaboration, and commitment. To achieve goals, not only management skills are needed but also a vision and mission from the leadership.


### Value 

Value is the difference between the cost of something and the benefits derived from it. For some assets, like inventory, calculating value is very straightforward—it is the difference between its purchase cost and selling price. However, for data, neither the cost nor the profit has a unified standard, making these calculations complex.

Each organization's data is unique, so assessing the value of data requires first calculating the general costs and various benefits incurred internally. Categories include:

1. The cost of acquiring and storing data.
2. The cost of replacing data if lost.
3. The impact of data loss on the organization.
4. The cost of risk mitigation and potential risk costs related to data.
5. The cost of improving data.
6. The advantages of high-quality data.
7. The fees competitors pay for data.
8. The potential selling price of data.
9. The expected revenue from innovative data applications.

### Data Optimization Plan

As mentioned in section 1.1, deriving value from data is not accidental and requires planning in various forms. Organizations must recognize that they can control how they acquire and create data. If data is viewed as a product being created, better decisions can be made throughout its lifecycle. These decisions require systemic thinking because they involve:

1. Data may be considered as existing independently of business processes.
2. The relationship between business processes and the technologies that support them.
3. The design and architecture of systems and the data they generate and store.
4. Ways data might be used to drive organizational strategy.

Better data planning requires strategic paths for architecture, modeling, and feature design. It also depends on strategic collaboration between business and IT leadership, as well as the execution strength of individual projects.

The challenge is that there is often long-term pressure from organizations, time, and money, which hinders the execution of optimization plans. Organizations must balance long-term goals with short-term objectives. Only by making clear trade-offs can effective decisions be achieved.

### Metadata and Data Management

Organizations need reliable metadata to manage data assets, which means comprehensively understanding metadata. It includes not only business and technical metadata and the metadata operations, but also metadata embedded in data architecture, data models, data security requirements, data integration standards, and data operation processes.

Metadata describes what data an organization has, what it represents, how it is classified, where it comes from, how it moves within the organization, how it evolves in use, who can use it, and whether it is high-quality. Data is abstract, and definitions and other descriptions in the context make the data clear and explicit. They make the data, the data lifecycle, and the complex systems containing the data easier to understand.

The challenge is that metadata is constituted in data form, thus requiring strict management. Organizations that do not manage their data well do not manage metadata at all. Metadata management is the starting point for comprehensive improvement of data management.

### Key impacts of data management on the data lifecycle:

1. Creation and use are key points in the data lifecycle. Managing data must be performed with an understanding of how data is generated or acquired and how it is used. Producing data costs money. Data only has value when it is consumed or applied.
2. Data quality management must permeate the entire data lifecycle. Data quality management is central to data management. Low-quality data means costs and risks, not value. Organizations often find managing data quality challenging, as mentioned previously, data is often created as a byproduct of operational processes, and organizations usually do not set clear standards for quality. Since the quality level of data may be affected by a range of lifecycle events, quality must be planned as part of the data lifecycle.
3. Metadata quality management must permeate the entire data lifecycle. Because metadata is a form of data and because organizations rely on it to manage other data, metadata quality must be managed in the same way as other data quality.
4. Data management also includes ensuring data security and reducing risks related to data. Data that needs protection must be protected throughout its entire lifecycle (from creation to destruction).
5. Data management efforts should focus on key data. Organizations produce a large amount of data, much of which is never actually used. It is impossible to manage every piece of data. Lifecycle management requires focusing on organizationally critical data and minimizing data ROT (Redundant, Obsolete, Trivial) (Aiken, 2014).

### Different Types of Data

Different types of data have different lifecycle management needs, making data management more complex. Any management system needs to classify the objects it manages. Data can be classified by type, such as transaction data, reference data, master data, metadata, or category data, source data, event data, detailed transaction data; or it can be classified by data content (such as data domains, subject areas), required formats, or protection levels, or by the ways and locations of storage or access (see Chapters 5 and 10).

Because different data types have different needs, are related to different risks, and play different roles in an organization, many data management tools focus on classification and control (Bryce, 2005). For example, master data and transaction data have different uses, so their management requirements differ.

### Data and Risks

Data represents not only value but also risks. Inaccurate, incomplete, or outdated low-quality data, due to its incorrect information, clearly represents risks. The risk of data lies in that it may be misunderstood and misused.

The highest quality data brings the greatest value to an organization—accessible, interrelated, complete, accurate, consistent, timely, applicable, meaningful, and easy to understand. However, there is often a gap in information—the difference between known information and needed information. This deficiency in the information gap can have a profound impact on operational efficiency and profits. Organizations aware of the value of high-quality data can take specific, proactive measures to improve the quality and availability of data and information within a regulatory and ethical cultural framework.

As the role of information as an organizational asset grows across all departments, regulators and legislators are increasingly concerned about the potential misuse of information in use. From the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (focused on controlling the accuracy and effectiveness of financial transaction data from transactions to balance sheets) to Solvency II (focused on supporting risk models and capital adequacy in the insurance industry), to the rapid growth of data privacy regulations over the past decade (including handling personal data within various industries and jurisdictions), it is evident, although financial departments are still waiting to list information as an asset on balance sheets, the regulatory environment increasingly hopes to include it in risk registers and take appropriate mitigation and control measures.

Similarly, as consumers become increasingly aware of how their data is used, they not only expect more smooth and efficient operational processes but also expect their information to be protected and their privacy respected. This means that for data management professionals, the range of strategic-level stakeholders is usually broader than in traditional circumstances (see Chapters 2 and 7).

Unfortunately, when these risks are not managed, shareholders express their opinions by selling shares, regulators impose fines or restrictions on company operations, and customers make choices with their wallets, thus increasing the impact of information management on the balance sheet.

### The composition of a data management strategy should include:

1. A compelling data management vision.
2. A summary of the business case for data management.
3. Guiding principles, values, and management perspectives.
4. The mission and long-term goals of data management.
5. Recommended measures for data management success.
6. Short-term (12-24 months) data management plan objectives that adhere to the SMART principles (Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Realistic, Time-bound).
7. A description of data management roles and organizations, and a summary of their responsibilities and decision-making authority.
8. Data management program components and initial tasks.
9. A priority work plan with a specific, clear scope.
10. A draft implementation roadmap containing projects and action tasks.

### Deliverables of data management strategic planning include:

1. Data management charter. Including overall vision, business case, objectives, guiding principles, success measurement standards, key success factors, identifiable risks, operational models, etc.
2. Data management scope statement. Including planning purposes and objectives (usually for 3 years), and the roles, organizations, and leaders responsible for achieving these goals.
3. Data management implementation roadmap. Identifying specific plans, project assignments, and delivery milestones (see Chapter 15).

### 1.3.1 Strategic Alignment Model

The Strategic Alignment Model (SAM) abstracts the basic driving factors of various data management methods (Henderson and Venkatraman, 1999), with the relationship between data and information at its core. Information is usually related to business strategy and the operational use of data. Data is associated with information technology and processes, which support the physical systems that make data accessible. Around this concept are the four basic areas of strategic choice: business strategy, IT strategy, organization and processes, and information systems.


### 1.3.2 The Amsterdam Information Model

The Amsterdam Information Model (AIM), like the Strategic Alignment Model, views the consistency between business and IT from a strategic perspective (Abcoower, Maes, and Truijens, 1997). It has nine units, abstracting a focus structure (including planning and architecture) and a strategic middle layer. Additionally, the necessity of information communication must be recognized.

The SAM (Strategic Alignment Model) and AIM (Amsterdam Information Model) frameworks describe the relationships between components in detail from two dimensions: the horizontal axis (business/IT strategy) and the vertical axis (business strategy/business operations).
