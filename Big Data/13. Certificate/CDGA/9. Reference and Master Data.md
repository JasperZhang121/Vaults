### Key Concepts on Reference and Master Data Management

#### **Malcolm Chisholm's Six-Level Data Classification**

1. Metadata
2. Reference Data
3. Enterprise Structure Data
4. Transaction Structure Data
5. Transaction Activity Data
6. Transaction Audit Data

- **Master Data** is defined as an aggregation of reference data, enterprise structure data, and transaction structure data. It represents business context in abstract, universal concepts, providing detailed information such as definitions and identifiers for internal and external objects involved in business transactions (e.g., customers, products, employees, suppliers, and controlled domains like code values).
    
- The main challenge for master data lies in **entity resolution**.

#### **Focus Areas for Reference and Master Data Management**

1. **Reference Data Management (RDM)**:
    
    - Focus on controlling domain values and their definitions.
    - Goal: Ensure access to a complete, accurate, and up-to-date set of values for each concept within the organization.
2. **Master Data Management (MDM)**:
    
    - Focus on controlling the values and identifiers of master data.
    - Goal: Enable the consistent use of the most accurate and timely data for core business entities across systems, reducing risks associated with ambiguous identifiers.
    
    _(A key challenge for RDM is determining ownership and responsibility for defining and maintaining reference data.)_  

#### **Reference Data**

- Defined as data used to describe or classify other data, or to connect data with external organizational information.
- Basic reference data consists of **codes** and **descriptions** and may include mappings and hierarchies.

##### **Types of Reference Data Structures**

1. **Lists**: Simplest form, consisting of code values and their descriptions.
2. **Cross-reference data lists**.
3. **Taxonomies**.
4. **Ontologies**: Often used for managing website content or as a type of metadata.  
    _(Other types include proprietary/internal, industry, geographic, statistical, computational, and standard reference datasets.)_  

#### **<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Common Storage Methods</mark> for Reference Data**

1. **Code Tables in Relational Databases**: Use foreign keys to maintain referential integrity.
2. **Reference Data Management Systems**: Designed to support wider application and integration use cases.
3. **Metadata-Specified Allowed Values**: Define permissible values directly in object attributes, focusing on application interfaces or user access.  

#### **Master Data**

- Represents authoritative data about business entities such as people, organizations, locations, or things.
- It must provide the **most accurate and authoritative data** about key business entities.  
    _(Key domains typically include participants, products/services, financial systems, and location data.)_  

##### **Key Concepts in Master Data**

1. **Systems of Record and Reference Systems**:
    
    - **System of Record**: Authoritative system with defined rules for data creation, acquisition, and maintenance.
    - **Reference System**: A reliable source from which data consumers can access trusted data.  
        _(Examples: MDM applications, Data Sharing Hubs, Data Warehouses.)_
2. **Trusted Sources and Golden Records**:
    
    - **Trusted Source**: A single, comprehensive, and accurate view of an entity (e.g., 360-degree view).
    - **Golden Record**: The most accurate and authoritative record of an entity.
3. **Master Data Management**:
    
    - A discipline combining **people, processes, and technology**, not a single application or solution.  

#### **Evaluating Master Data Management**

Key considerations include:

1. Repeatedly referenced roles, organizations, locations, and objects.
2. Data used to describe these entities.
3. Data definitions, designs, and granularity levels.
4. Data creation, storage, and access points.
5. Data transformation across systems.
6. Users and their purposes for using the data.
7. Standards for assessing data quality and reliability.  

### **Basic Steps in Planning Master Data Management**

1. Identify candidate data sources capable of providing a comprehensive view of master data entities.
2. Establish rules for precisely matching and merging entities and instances.
3. Develop methods for identifying and resolving improperly matched or merged data.
4. Create methods to distribute trusted data across the enterprise's systems.  

### **Master Data Management as a <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Lifecycle Process</mark>**

Key activities include:

1. Establishing the context of master data entities, including defining related attributes and their usage conditions, and governing them.
2. Identifying multiple instances representing the same entity within a single data source or across multiple sources; building and maintaining identifiers and cross-references to support data integration.
3. Coordinating and consolidating data from different sources to create the best version of a master record or fact. This involves addressing inconsistencies in attribute naming and data values.
4. Identifying instances not properly matched or merged, ensuring corrections, and associating them with the correct identifiers.
5. Enabling cross-application access to trusted data through direct access, data services, or replication to transactional systems, data warehouses, or other analytical data storage systems.
6. Enforcing the use of master data across the organization with support from data governance and change management, ensuring a shared enterprise perspective.  


### **Key Processing Steps in Master Data Management**

1. **Data Model Management**:
    
    - Terms and definitions used at the enterprise level should align with the organization's business processes.
    - Attributes of master data and their granularity must be meaningful across the organization.
    - Multiple attributes with different names in various systems should be consolidated into a single attribute in the model.  

2. **Data Collection**:
    
    - A reliable and repeatable process is essential, from planning and evaluating new data sources to determining MDM solutions. Activities include:
        1. Receiving and addressing requests for new data sources.
        2. Performing rapid quality assessments using data cleaning and analysis tools.
        3. Evaluating data and sharing integration complexities with requesters for cost-benefit analysis.
        4. Piloting data collection and assessing its impact on matching rules.
        5. Defining data quality metrics for new sources.
        6. Determining responsibilities for monitoring and maintaining data quality.  
3. **<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Data Validation, Standardization, and Enrichment</mark>**:
    
    - Ensure consistency while resolving entities:
        1. **Validation**: Identify and correct incorrect or default data.
        2. **Standardization**: Ensure data aligns with standard reference values, formats, or fields (e.g., country codes, phone numbers, addresses).
        3. **Data Enrichment**: Add attributes to improve entity resolution services.  
4. **<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Entity Resolution and Identifier Management</mark>**:
    
    - **Entity Resolution**: Determine whether references point to the same or different real-world objects. Activities include:
        
        1. Instance extraction, preparation, and resolution.
        2. Identity management and relationship analysis.  
    - **Matching**:
        
        - **False Positives**: Different objects incorrectly linked under one identifier.
        - **False Negatives**: Same object incorrectly split across multiple identifiers.  
            Solutions include deterministic or probabilistic algorithms.
    - **Matching Processes and Coordination Types**:
        
        1. **Duplicate Identification Rules**: Focus on identifying consolidation opportunities without auto-merging.
        2. **Matching Link Rules**: Establish cross-references to records without updating content.
        3. **Matching and Merging Rules**: Focus on unifying data into a single, cohesive record.  
    - **Master Data ID Management**:
        
        - Two types of identifiers: **Global IDs** (unique identifiers for entity instances) and **Cross-References** (managing relationships between source IDs and global IDs).  
    - **Subordinate Relationship Management**:
        
        - Manage hierarchical or subordinate relationships among entity records. Examples include affiliation and parent-child relationships.  
5. **Data Sharing and Responsibility Management**:
    
    - While automation can help, human involvement remains essential.

#### **Industry Master Data – Reference Directories**

Authoritative lists of master data entities (e.g., companies, people, products). These directories are created by external organizations but maintained within the organization's systems, such as the Dun & Bradstreet (D&B) directory. 

#### **Three Basic Approaches to Master Data Hub Environments**

1. **Registry**: An index pointing to master data records in various systems of record.
2. **Transaction Hub**: Master data resides within the hub itself and not in any other application. It serves as the system of record for master data.
3. **Hybrid Model (Consolidated)**: Combines registry and transaction hub approaches. Local master data is managed within the system of record applications, while master data is consolidated in a common repository and shared via a data sharing hub.
