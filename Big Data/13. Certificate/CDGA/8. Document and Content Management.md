### Overview

File and content management involves the processes for collecting, storing, accessing, and using data and information stored <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">outside relational databases</mark>. It focuses on maintaining integrity, ensuring accessibility, and securing high-quality content through reliable architecture and well-managed metadata.

### Business Drivers

1. Regulatory compliance requirements.
2. Litigation response capabilities.
3. Electronic discovery requests.
4. Business continuity requirements.
5. Improving organizational efficiency.

### <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Goals</mark>

1. Ensure high-speed and efficient collection and use of unstructured data and information.
2. Enable integration between structured and unstructured data.
3. Comply with legal obligations and meet customer expectations. 

### <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Principles</mark>

1. Everyone in the organization should play a role in safeguarding its future by following established procedures for creating, using, retrieving, and disposing of records.
2. Records and content processing experts must actively participate in policy and planning development. 

### ARMA’s GARP Principles (2009)

1. Accountability.
2. Integrity.
3. Protection.
4. Compliance.
5. Availability.
6. Retention.
7. Disposition.
8. Transparency. 

### Metadata for Unstructured Content

Key attributes include:

- Format.
- Searchability.
- Self-descriptiveness.
- Existing patterns.
- Content themes.
- Requirements.

### Content Modeling

The process of converting logical content concepts into content types, attributes, and data types with relationships. It occurs on two levels:

1. **Information Product Level**.
2. **Component Level**. 

### Content Distribution Methods

1. **Push-based**: e.g., RSS feeds.
2. **Pull-based**: e.g., browsing on e-commerce sites like Taobao.
3. **Interactive**: e.g., Enterprise Application Integration (EAI), change data capture, and Enterprise Information Integration (EII).

### Controlled Vocabulary

A list of terms explicitly allowed for indexing, classifying, labeling, sorting, and retrieving content through browsing and searching.

- **Key Aspects of Management**:
    
    - Purpose.
    - Consumers.
    - Standards.
    - Maintenance.
- **Types**:
    
    - Vocabulary View: A subset of the controlled vocabulary for specific domains.
    - Micro-Controlled Vocabulary: Includes highly specialized terms not covered in general vocabularies.

### Terminology Management

Relationships between terms in controlled vocabularies:

1. **Equivalent Term Relationship**.
2. **Hierarchical Relationship**: General-to-specific or whole-to-part connections.
3. **Related Term Relationship**: Associated but not hierarchical.

### Documents vs. Records

- **Documents**: Electronic or paper objects containing task instructions, logs, and requirements.
- **Records**: A subset of documents that provide evidence of decisions and actions in compliance with procedures.

### File Management

The process of controlling and organizing files and records throughout their lifecycle. <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">It focuses on storage, cataloging, and controlling files with minimal emphasis on content.</mark> Market and regulatory pressures highlight aspects like retention schedules, locations, transfer, and destruction. 

### Lifecycle Management of Files and Records

1. Cataloging.
2. Establishing policies.
3. Classification.
4. Storage.
5. Retrieval and distribution.
6. Preservation and disposition.

### <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Information Architecture</mark>

The structure created for managing information or content, including:

1. Controlled vocabularies.
2. Taxonomies and ontologies.
3. Metadata mapping.
4. Search functionality specifications.
5. Use cases.
6. User flows.

### Semantic Modeling and Search

- **Semantic Modeling**: A knowledge modeling approach describing concepts and their relationships, with attributes like cardinality, domains, and constraints.
- **Semantic Search**: Focuses on semantics and context rather than pre-defined keywords, leveraging AI to understand user intent.

### Activities in Content Management

#### **Planning Lifecycle Management**

1. Plan record management.
2. Develop content strategies, starting with gap assessments and metadata classification. 

#### **Create Content Policies**

Policies typically include:

1. Audit scope and compliance.
2. Identification and protection of critical records.
3. Retention purposes and schedules.
4. Procedures for legal hold orders.
5. Requirements for local and offsite storage.
6. Maintenance of hard drives and shared network drives.
7. Content-focused email management.
8. Proper record destruction methods. _(P244-245)_

#### **Define Content Information Architecture**

- Retrieve needed information from structured and unstructured data. 

#### **Implement Lifecycle Management**

1. Acquisition of records and content.
2. Version control management.
3. Backup and recovery.
4. Retention and disposition management.
5. File/record audits. 

#### **Publish and Distribute Content**

1. Provide open access, search, and retrieval.
2. Distribute through acceptable channels. 

### ANSI 859 Data Control Levels

1. **Formal Control**.
2. **Revision Control**.
3. **Managed Control**. 

### <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Tools</mark>

1. Enterprise Content Management (ECM) systems.
2. Collaboration tools.
3. Controlled vocabulary and metadata tools.
4. Standard markup and exchange formats (XML, JSON, RDF, Schema.org).
5. Electronic discovery tools. 

### Methods

- **Litigation Response Handbook**: A guide for handling litigation responses.
- **Litigation Response Mapping**: Includes timelines such as the 90-day limit for compliance. 

### Enterprise Content Management (ECM) Readiness Assessment

The purpose of an ECM readiness assessment is to identify areas where content management needs improvement and evaluate the organization’s ability to adapt its processes to meet those needs. 

### ARMA Information Governance Maturity Model

1. **Level 1: Sub-Standard**
    
    - Information governance and records management issues are either unresolved or minimally addressed.
2. **Level 2: In Development**
    
    - Recognition of the potential impact of information governance and records management on the organization.
3. **Level 3: Essential**
    
    - Meets the minimum legal and regulatory requirements.
4. **Level 4: Proactive**
    
    - An active information governance program focused on continuous improvement is established.
5. **Level 5: Transformational**
    
    - Information governance is fully integrated into the organization’s infrastructure and business processes. 

### Information Governance Reference Model (IGRM)

The IGRM illustrates the relationships between information governance and other information-related functions within an organization. 

### Growth of Unstructured Data

Unstructured data is growing at a significantly faster rate than structured data. Effective management of unstructured data requires collaboration between data stewards, other data management professionals, and records managers. 

### Metrics

1. **Records Management**:
    
    - Percentage of documents/emails identified as company records.
    - Percentage of identified records under control.
    - Percentage of stored records with proper retention rules.
2. **Electronic Discovery**:
    
    - Cost reductions.
    - Efficiency improvements compared to passive collection.
3. **Enterprise Content Management (ECM)**:
    
    - Tangible benefits: Increased productivity, cost reduction, better compliance.
    - Intangible benefits: Improved collaboration, simplified workflows.
