### Architecture

- **Definition**: An organized design of components aimed at optimizing the functionality, performance, feasibility, cost, and user experience of an overall structure or system. It is the fundamental structure of a system, reflected in the components, their interrelations, and the principles guiding their design and evolution. It operates across different scopes and levels, defining complex elements in a clear and explicit manner. 
- **Enterprise Architecture**: Includes business architecture, data architecture, application architecture, and technology architecture. A good architecture helps organizations understand system status, accelerate improvements, and achieve regulatory compliance and efficiency goals. 
- **Data Architecture**: Forms the foundation of data management and needs to be described at various levels for better understanding and decision-making. 

### Components and Goals of Data Architecture

- **Components**: Description of the current state, definition of data requirements, guidance for data integration, and data asset management standards. 
- **Goals**: Build a bridge between business strategies and technical implementation. It is a part of enterprise architecture. 

### Business-Driven Factors

- Build a smooth bridge between business strategy and technical implementation. Key responsibilities include:
    1. Strategically assisting organizations in rapidly transforming products, services, and data using emerging technologies.
    2. Converting business needs into data and application requirements to ensure effective data support for business processes.
    3. Managing complex data and information across the enterprise.
    4. Aligning business and IT technologies.
    5. Supporting organizational reform, transformation, and adaptability improvements. 

### Key Outputs and Work of Data Architects

- **Outputs**:
    1. Data storage and processing requirements.
    2. Designing structures and plans to meet current and long-term data needs.
- **Work**:
    1. Define the current state of data.
    2. Provide standard business vocabulary for data and components.
    3. Ensure alignment of data architecture with enterprise strategy and business architecture.
    4. Describe data strategy requirements.
    5. High-level data integration design.
    6. Develop enterprise data architecture blueprints. 

### Implementation of Data Architecture

- Use data architecture components (main blueprints) to define data requirements, guide integration, manage data assets, and align data projects with enterprise strategy. 
- Collaborate with stakeholders involved in business or IT system improvements to influence and learn from them.
- Establish a common enterprise data language using the architecture and vocabulary.

### Definition and Objectives of Data Architecture

- **Definition**: Identify enterprise data needs (regardless of data structure) and design and maintain a master blueprint to meet these needs. The blueprint guides data integration, controls data assets, and aligns data investments with business strategies. 
- **Objectives**:
    1. Identify data storage and processing requirements.
    2. Design structures and plans to meet current and long-term enterprise data needs.
    3. Strategically prepare the organization to rapidly develop its products, services, and data, aligning data investments with business strategies.  
        _(Identify needs. Design structures. Strategic preparation.)_ 

### Data Architecture Activities and Tools

- **Activities**:
    1. Establish enterprise data architecture (evaluate current architecture standards, create roadmaps, manage enterprise-level requirements in projects).
    2. Integrate with other enterprise architectures. 
- **Inputs**: Enterprise architecture, business architecture, IT standards and goals, data strategies.
- **Deliverables**: Data architecture design, data flow, data value chains, enterprise data models, and implementation roadmaps. 
- **Tools**:
    1. Data modeling tools.
    2. Asset management software (to manage data resource catalogs and track relationships).
    3. Graphic design applications. 

### Enterprise Architecture Frameworks and Examples

- **Types**: Business architecture, data architecture, application architecture, and technology architecture. 
- **Purposes**:
    - **Business Architecture**: Identifies how the organization creates value for customers and stakeholders.
    - **Data Architecture**: Describes how data should be organized and managed.
    - **Application Architecture**: Describes the structure and functions of enterprise applications.
    - **Technology Architecture**: Describes the technical elements that enable systems to function and deliver value.

**Dependencies**: Business architecture influences the design of other architectures. Data architecture supports managing business architecture and specified data. Application architecture processes the required data based on business needs. Technology architecture supports and executes the application architecture.
