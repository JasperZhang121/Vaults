### Data Warehouse Overview

- **Data Warehouse (DW)**:  
    Originating in the 1980s and evolving through the 1990s, data warehouses developed in tandem with **Business Intelligence (BI)** as the primary drivers of business decision-making. They enable organizations to integrate data from various sources into a unified data model. The consolidated data provides insights into business operations, supports enterprise decision-making, and unlocks new possibilities for creating organizational value. <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Data warehouses reduce redundancy, enhance information consistency, and empower enterprises to make better data-driven decisions. As a result, the data warehouse has become the cornerstone of enterprise data management. </mark>
    
- **<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Business Drivers</mark>**:
    
    1. **Operational Support Functions**
    2. **Compliance Requirements** (e.g., responding to historical data inquiries)
    3. **Business Intelligence Activities** (Primary driver: providing insights, improving efficiency, and enhancing competitive advantage). 

### **Goals of Data Warehouse Construction**:

1. Support business intelligence activities.
2. Empower business analysis and efficient decision-making.
3. Drive innovation through data insights. 

### **Principles for Data Warehouse Construction**:

1. Focus on business goals: Address the highest-priority business needs and resolve them.
2. Start with the end in mind: Prioritize business needs and drive warehouse creation by desired outcomes.
3. Think globally, act locally: Adopt a holistic design while implementing incrementally.
4. Learn and continuously optimize: Improvements should be iterative, not preemptively exhaustive.
5. Enhance transparency and self-service: Ensure ease of access for stakeholders.
6. Build metadata alongside the data warehouse: Success depends on accurately interpreting the data.
7. Collaborate: Coordinate with other data activities, especially data governance, data quality, and metadata management.
8. Avoid one-size-fits-all solutions: Provide appropriate tools and products for different types of data consumers. 

### Activities

1. Understand requirements.
2. Define and maintain DW (Data Warehouse) and BI (Business Intelligence) architectures.
3. Develop data warehouses and data marts.
4. Load data into the warehouse.
5. Implement BI product portfolios.
6. Maintain data products.

#### Business Intelligence (BI):

1. **Definition 1**: BI refers to data analysis activities that understand organizational needs and identify opportunities. The insights generated aim to enhance decision-making success.
2. **Definition 2**: BI is also a set of technologies that support these data analysis activities. 

#### Data Warehouse:

An integrated decision-support database, along with associated software programs for collecting, cleansing, transforming, and storing data from various operational and external sources. A data mart is a subset of data warehouse data. Broadly speaking, a data warehouse encompasses all data stores or operations that support BI goals. 

#### Data Warehouse Construction:

Processes include <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">extracting, cleansing, transforming, controlling, and loading data into the warehouse</mark>. The emphasis is on creating an integrated, historical business environment from operational data through enforced business rules and appropriate data relationships. This also involves interacting with metadata repositories. Traditionally focused on structured data, data warehousing now includes semi-structured and unstructured data. 

#### Data Warehouse Construction Approaches:

Bill Inmon and Ralph Kimball are two thought leaders who used **normalized modeling** and **dimensional modeling**, respectively, for data warehouse modeling. _(P293)_

- **Bill Inmon**: Defined a data warehouse in _"Building the Data Warehouse"_ as “<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">a subject-oriented, integrated, time-variant, and non-volatile collection of data to support management and decision-making in an enterprise.</mark>”
- **Ralph Kimball**: Advocated for a bottom-up approach in _"The Data Warehouse Toolkit"_, emphasizing the construction of data marts. He defined data marts as “copies of transaction data tailored for queries and analysis.”

#### Common Core Concepts:

1. Data originates from other systems.
2. Data integration enhances value.
3. Data is made accessible and analyzable.
4. Reliable and integrated data is made available to authorized stakeholders.
5. Construction purposes include workflow support, operational management, and predictive analytics.

### **<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Corporate Information Factory</mark> (CIF):**

1. **Subject-Oriented**: Focuses on subjects rather than functions or applications.
2. **Integrated**: Data is unified and cohesive.
3. **Time-Variant**: Stores data over specific time periods.
4. **Stable**: Data is not frequently updated. New data is appended to existing data, with each record representing different transaction states.
5. **Aggregated and Detailed Data**: Contains both atomic transaction details and aggregated data.
6. **Historical**: Includes both current and historical data. _(P293)_

#### **Components of the CIF (Inmon’s Model):**

1. **Applications**
2. **Data Staging Area**
3. **Integration and Transformation**
4. **Operational Data Store (ODS)**
5. **Data Marts**
6. **Operational Data Marts (OpDM)**: These data marts focus on supporting operational decision-making, retrieving data directly from the ODS instead of the data warehouse. They share characteristics with the ODS, including frequently changing data and current or recent data.
7. **Data Warehouse**: Data flows unidirectionally into data marts.
8. **Operational Reporting**: Outputs reports from data storage.
9. **Reference Data, Master Data, and External Data**

### **Data Flow Transformation (Business Systems to Data Marts):**

1. **Objective**: From functional execution to data analysis.
2. **Users**: From business operators to decision-makers.
3. **Usage**: From fixed operations to ad-hoc queries.
4. **Time Sensitivity**: From high real-time demands to less stringent requirements.
5. **Scope**: From small datasets to larger, more comprehensive datasets. 

### **Differences Between Data in Warehouses/Marts and Applications:**

1. Organized by subject domains rather than functional requirements.
2. Integrated instead of isolated.
3. Represents a series of time-variant data rather than only current snapshots.
4. Higher latency.
5. Includes extensive historical data. 

### **Multidimensional Data Warehouse (Kimball):**

A copy of transactional data specifically designed for querying and analysis. It is not organized according to normalized entity-relationship models.

- **Multidimensional Model (Star Schema):**
    - Composed of **Fact Tables**: Contain quantitative data about business processes (e.g., sales data).
    - Includes **Dimension Tables**: Store descriptive attributes related to fact table data, enabling answers to queries such as "How much of Product X was sold this quarter?"
    - Fact tables link to many dimension tables, and the structure resembles a star.
    - Multiple fact tables share common dimensions or adhere to consistent dimensions via a "bus" design. _(P296)_

### **Kimball’s Data Warehouse Framework Includes Four Parts:**

1. **Business Source Systems**
2. **Data Staging Area**
3. **Data Presentation Area**
4. **Data Access Tools**

### **Data Warehouse Bus Matrix**

- The bus matrix illustrates the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">intersection of business processes that generate fact data and the dimensional data subject areas</mark>.
- It is independent of technology and represents the long-term data content requirements of a data warehouse/BI system.
- This helps organizations define a manageable development scope.

### **Data Warehouse Environment**

- A collection of architectural components organized to meet enterprise needs, including source systems, data integration, and data storage areas.
- Big data solutions typically follow an ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) approach, where data is loaded first and processed later.

### **Data Storage Areas in Data Warehouse Architecture:**

1. **Staging Area**:
    - An intermediate storage area between raw data sources and the centralized repository.
2. **Reference Data and Master Data Consistent Dimensions**:
    - Ensures alignment and consistency across shared dimensions.
3. **Central Data Warehouse**:
    - Key design elements include:
        1. Relationships between business keys and surrogate keys for performance optimization.
        2. Indexes and foreign keys to support dimension tables.
        3. Change Data Capture (CDC) techniques for detecting, maintaining, and storing historical data.
4. **Operational Data Store (ODS)**:
    - Contains a time window of data rather than the full history, enabling faster refresh rates than a data warehouse.
5. **Data Marts**:
    - Focused on specific subject areas, departments, or business processes.
6. **Data Cubes**:
    - Support OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) systems in three classic forms: relational, multidimensional, and hybrid storage structures. 

### **Data Warehouse/BI and Big Data Architectures**

- Data warehouse construction involves two primary types of data integration processes:
    1. **Historical Data Loading**
    2. **Ongoing Data Updates** 

#### **Historical Data Processing:**

1. **Inmon's Data Warehouse**:
    - <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">All data is stored in a single data warehouse layer containing cleansed, standardized, and governed atomic data</mark>.
2. **Kimball's Data Warehouse**:
    - <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Data warehouse is an integration of department-level data marts containing cleansed, standardized, and governed data</mark>.
    - These data marts store historical records at the atomic level, supported by consistent dimension and fact tables to deliver enterprise-level information.
3. **Data Vault**:
    - Used as part of the staging process, performing data cleansing and standardization.
    - Historical data is stored in a normalized atomic structure, defining surrogate keys, primary keys, and alternate keys. 

#### **Batch Change Data Capture (CDC):**

- Data warehouses typically load data through nightly batch processing windows.
- Since different source systems may require various change capture techniques, the loading process can include multiple methods of change detection. 

|**Complexity**|**Fact Table Load**|**Dimension Table Load**|**Change Detection Method**|**Source System Requirements**|**Load Complexity**|**Load Speed**|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Timestamp Incremental Load**|Append|Overwrite|Changes identified using system date and timestamps|Low|Medium|Fast|
|**Log Table Incremental Load**|Append|Append|Changes captured and recorded in a log table|Medium|Medium|Normal|
|**Database Transaction Logs**|Append|Append|Database transaction logs track changes|High|High|Normal|
|**Message Incremental Load**|Append|Overwrite|Changes published as real-time messages (queues)|Very High|Extreme|Slow|
|**Full Load**|Overwrite|Overwrite|No change identifiers; extracts the entire table to compare|Very Low|Low|Slow|

### **Near-Real-Time and Real-Time Data Loading**

1. **Trickle Loading (Source-Side Accumulation)**:
    - Unlike nightly batch windows, this method performs batch loads at more frequent intervals or based on thresholds (micro-batching).
2. **Message Delivery (Bus Accumulation)**:
    - Small data packets are sent to a message bus, and target systems subscribe to the bus (e.g., using MQ).
3. **Streaming (Target-Side Accumulation)**:
    - Target systems collect data using buffers or queues and process it sequentially (e.g., Kafka).

#### **Operational Reports**

- Generated by business users directly from transaction systems, applications, or DWs.
- Ad hoc query tools allow users to create and share reports.
- Traditional BI tools offer data visualizations like tables, pie charts, bar charts, and more. 

#### **<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)</mark>**

- Enables fast performance for multidimensional queries with operations like slicing, dicing, drill-down, roll-up, and pivoting.
- **Three OLAP Types**:
    1. Relational OLAP (ROLAP).
    2. Multidimensional OLAP (MOLAP).
    3. Hybrid OLAP (HOLAP). 

#### **Best Practices and Readiness Assessments**

1. **Prototyping to Drive Requirements**: Use data profiling, state assessment, and source system evaluation to mitigate risks.
2. **Self-Service BI**: Deliver reports based on user permissions and ensure data auditability.
3. **Audit Data**: Allow fine-grained tracking for improved user confidence and issue resolution. 

**Readiness Assessments and Risk Evaluations**:

5. **Vision Alignment**: IT strategies must support the business vision.

#### **Governance in DW/BI**

- Governance processes must minimize risk while maintaining quality and stability.
- Key areas include business acceptance, customer satisfaction, SLAs, and reporting strategies. 

### **Business Acceptance**

A critical success factor is the extent to which business stakeholders accept the data. This includes data that is understandable, has verifiable quality, and traceable lineage. Key considerations include:

1. **Conceptual Data Model**:
    
    - What are the core pieces of information?
    - What are the key business concepts, and how are they related to each other?
2. **Data Quality Feedback Loop**:
    
    - How are data issues identified and corrected?
    - How can the source of the issues be understood?
    - Who is responsible for resolving problems?
    - What processes are in place to address integration issues arising during the data warehousing process?
3. **End-to-End Metadata**:
    
    - How does the architecture support an integrated metadata flow across the entire system?
    - Is the context of the data well-understood?
    - How can data consumers answer fundamental questions such as "What does this report mean?" or "What does this metric represent?"
4. **End-to-End Verifiable Data Lineage**:
    
    - Are publicly accessible items for business users traceable back to the source systems in an automated and maintainable way?
    - Is all data properly documented? 

### **Reporting Strategy**

A comprehensive reporting strategy must address:

1. **Secure Access**:
    
    - Ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive data.
2. **Access Mechanisms**:
    
    - Describe how users interact with, report on, review, or view data.
3. **User Community and Tools**:
    
    - Identify types of user communities and the appropriate tools for their needs.
4. **Report Details**:
    
    - Define the nature of summaries, detailed information, exceptions, frequency, timing, distribution, and storage formats.
5. **Visualization**:
    
    - Leverage graphical outputs to maximize the potential of visualization capabilities.
6. **Timeliness vs. Performance Trade-offs**:
    
    - Strike a balance between data delivery speed and performance efficiency. 

### **Metrics and Indicators**
