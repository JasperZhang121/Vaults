### **Key Processes**

- **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)**:
    
    1. **Extract**: Select and retrieve necessary data from source systems.
    2. **Transform**: Convert data into a compatible structure with the target system.
    3. **Load**: Physically store or present the transformed data in the target system.
    4. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">If the target system has stronger transformation capabilities than the source system or intermediate application system, the order of data processing can be switched to ELT - Extract, Load, Transform</mark>.
- **Latency Types**:
    
    1. Batch processing.
    2. Change data capture.
    3. Near real-time and event-driven.
    4. Real-time and synchronous.
    5. Low latency or stream processing.

### **Change Data Capture Techniques**

- Methods to reduce bandwidth requirements by filtering data, including only the updates within a specific time range:
    1. The source system populates specific data elements.
    2. The source system adds modified data to a simple object and identifier list to control data extraction.
    3. The source system replicates the changed data. 

### **Enterprise Message Formats / Standard Formats**

- General models used to standardize data-sharing formats. 

### **Interaction Models**

1. **Point-to-Point**:
    - Challenges: processing impact, interface management, and potential inconsistencies.
2. **Hub-and-Spoke**.
3. **Publish and Subscribe**. 

### **Enterprise Application Integration Model (EAI)**

- **Definition**: Interaction between software modules occurs solely through well-defined application programming interfaces (APIs).
    
- **Key Features**:
    
    1. Data storage is updated only through its associated software module.
    2. Other modules access data exclusively via defined APIs.
    3. Based on object-oriented concepts, emphasizing reusability and replacement of any module without impacting others.
- **Enterprise Service Bus (ESB)**:
    
    - Acts as a mediator between systems to facilitate message transmission.
    - Applications use ESB's encapsulated features to send and receive messages or files.
    - ESB functions as a loosely coupled intermediary between applications.
- **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)**:
    
    - Defines services between applications for data pushing or updates.
    - Objectives:
        1. Ensure well-defined interactions between independent software modules.
        2. Include services such as add, delete, update, and retrieve.
