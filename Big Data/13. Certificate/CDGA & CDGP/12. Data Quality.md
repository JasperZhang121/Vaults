### Factors Leading to Poor Data Quality

- Lack of organizational understanding of the impact of low-quality data.
- Inadequate planning.
- Siloed system design.
- Inconsistent development processes.
- Incomplete documentation.
- Lack of standards or governance. 

### Universality of Data Quality Issues

- No organization has perfect business processes, technical processes, or data management practices.
- All organizations face data quality issues.
- Organizations with formal data quality management experience fewer problems than those without. 

### Cross-Functional Commitment and Coordination

- Data quality management is not a one-time project; it is an ongoing effort.
- Long-term success depends on cultural changes and the establishment of a quality mindset.
- High-quality data is not an end goal but a means to achieve organizational success. 


### Business Drivers for Data Quality Management

1. Enhance the value and utility of organizational data.
2. Reduce risks and costs associated with low-quality data.
3. Improve organizational efficiency and productivity.
4. Protect and enhance organizational reputation.  
    _[Create opportunities, reduce costs, boost efficiency, strengthen reputation]_

### Consequences of Poor Data Quality

### Definition of Data Quality

Data quality refers to the characteristics of high-quality data and the processes used to measure or improve it. It depends on the context in which the data is used and the needs of the data consumers. Expectations related to quality are not always explicit. Customers may not fully understand their quality expectations, and data managers may not proactively inquire about them.

### Focus of Data Quality Management

Data quality management should concentrate on the organization's and customers' most critical data. The priority can be determined by considering:

1. Regulatory reports
2. Financial reports
3. Business policies
4. Business continuity
5. Business strategies, particularly differentiation strategies.

### Dimensions of Data Quality

Data quality dimensions represent measurable characteristics of data, providing a vocabulary to define data quality requirements and evaluate quality.

#### Strong-Wang Framework (1996)

Focused on data consumers' perspectives, categorizing data quality into 4 groups with 15 indicators:

1. **Intrinsic Data Quality**
    - Accuracy
    - Objectivity
    - Credibility
    - Reputation
2. **Contextual Data Quality**
    - Added value
    - Relevance
    - Timeliness
    - Completeness
    - Appropriate amount
3. **Representational Data Quality**
    - Interpretability
    - Ease of understanding
    - Consistency of representation
    - Conciseness
4. **Accessibility Data Quality**
    - Accessibility
    - Access security

#### Thomas Redman's Framework ("Data Quality for the Information Age")

Defines a data item as a "representable triplet" consisting of an entity, an attribute domain, and a value set. Dimensions can relate to any data component: models (entities and attributes) and their values.

#### Data Quality Framework Dimensions

1. **Data Models**
    - **Content**: Data relevance, ability to derive value, clarity in definition.
    - **Level of Detail**: Granularity of feature descriptions.
2. **Attribute Domain Precision**
    - **Structure**: Naturalness, uniqueness, minimal redundancy.
    - **Consistency**: Semantic and structural consistency.
    - **Adaptability**: Robustness and flexibility.
    - **Data Values**: Accuracy, completeness, currency, consistency.
    - **Data Representation**: Appropriateness, interpretability, portability, precise formatting, storage efficiency.

#### Larry English's Framework

1. **Intrinsic Quality Characteristics**
    - Consistency in definitions
    - Completeness of value domains
    - Validity and adherence to business rules
    - Accuracy of data sources
    - Real-world accuracy
    - Precision
    - Non-redundancy
    - Equivalence and concurrency in distributed data
2. **Practical Quality Characteristics**
    - Accessibility
    - Timeliness
    - Context clarity
    - Usability
    - Integrability across multiple sources
    - Appropriateness and completeness of facts

### Core Dimensions of Data Quality (DAMA UK, 2013)

1. **Completeness**: Percentage of stored data compared to potential data.
2. **Uniqueness**: Avoiding duplicate records of the same entity.
3. **Timeliness**: How well data reflects reality at the required time.
4. **Validity**: Conformance to syntax (format, type, range).
5. **Accuracy**: Degree to which data correctly describes real-world objects or events.
6. **Consistency**: Comparisons of representations and definitions of the same data.

#### Additional Influential Characteristics

- **Usability**
- **Timing issues** (beyond timeliness)
- **Flexibility**
- **Confidence**
- **Value**

### Common Data Quality Dimensions

|**Quality Dimension**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|**Accuracy**|Accuracy refers to the degree to which data correctly represents the "real" entity. Accuracy is difficult to describe unless the organization can replicate the data or manually verify the recorded accuracy. Most accuracy measurements rely on comparison with verified accurate data sources, such as reliable records or systems (e.g., Dun & Bradstreet reference data).|
|**Completeness**|Completeness refers to whether all necessary data is present. It can be measured at the dataset, record, or column level. Dataset-level measurement may require comparison with the record source or rely on historical levels of the dataset.|
|**Consistency**|Consistency refers to the degree of alignment in how data values are expressed within and across datasets. It may also refer to the consistency in dataset size and composition across systems or over time. Consistency can be defined between sets of attribute values within the same record (record-level consistency), across records (cross-record consistency), or for the same set of attribute values at different time points within a record (temporal consistency). Consistency can also refer to format uniformity.|
|**Integrity**|Integrity typically refers to referential integrity (ensuring consistency between data objects via reference keys in two objects) or internal consistency within a dataset, avoiding missing or incomplete data. A dataset without integrity is considered corrupted or data-lost. Datasets lacking referential integrity are called "orphans" (invalid reference keys) or "duplicates," which are rows that may negatively impact aggregate functions. The level of orphan records can be measured as a percentage of raw data or the dataset.|
|**Reasonability**|The degree to which data patterns align with expectations. This is relatively subjective.|
|**Timeliness**|Expected volatility. Timeliness refers to how current the data is. Volatile data must be kept up-to-date over short periods.|
|**Uniqueness/Deduplication**|Uniqueness means that no entity within a dataset appears more than once. Entity uniqueness in a dataset implies that key values correspond to a specific unique entity. Uniqueness can be measured by testing key structures.|
|**Validity**|Validity refers to whether data values align with the defined value domain. A domain may be defined as a set of valid values from a reference table, a valid range, or values determinable by a rule.|

### ISO 8000 Overview

ISO 8000 is still under development, designed to enable the exchange of complex data in an application-independent format. The standard defines quality data as "portable data that meets specified requirements." The goal of ISO 8000 is to help organizations define what constitutes quality data, identify non-quality data, enforce compliance with quality data standards, and verify that the received data adheres to the same quality standards.

**ISO 8000 Part 61**: "Information and Data Quality Management Process Reference Model" describes the structure and organization of data quality management, including:

1. Data quality planning
2. Data quality control
3. Data quality assurance
4. Data quality improvement


### Data Quality Improvement Lifecycle

1. **Plan**  
    The data quality team assesses the scope, impact, and priority of known issues, evaluating alternatives for resolving them.
2. **Do**  
    The team works on addressing the root causes of issues and creates plans for continuous data monitoring.
3. **Check**  
    Includes active monitoring and measuring of data quality against specified thresholds.
4. **Act**  
    Involves activities to address and resolve newly emerging data quality issues.

The Deming Cycle for data quality improvement starts anew when:

1. Current measurements fall below thresholds.
2. New datasets are under investigation.
3. New data quality requirements are introduced for existing datasets.
4. Business rules, standards, or expectations change.


### Types of Data Quality Business Rules

Business rules describe how a business should operate internally to remain aligned with the external world. Data quality business rules define the existence and form of useful and available data within an organization.

**Common types of business rules**:

1. Definition consistency
2. Numerical presence and record completeness (rules defining acceptable missing values)
3. Format compliance
4. Value domain matching
5. Range consistency
6. Mapping consistency (values assigned to data elements must correspond to equivalent value domains)
7. Consistency rules (conditions between attributes based on actual values)
8. Accuracy verification
9. Uniqueness verification
10. Timeliness verification (rules related to data accessibility and availability expectations)
11. Other types, e.g.:
    - Reasonableness of record counts in files
    - Reasonableness of average values computed from transactions
    - Expected variance in transaction counts over a specified time period

### Common Causes of Data Quality Issues

Data quality problems can arise at any point in the data lifecycle.

#### (1) Leadership Issues

Quality problems often stem from a lack of organizational commitment to high-quality data, which reflects poor governance and leadership. Leadership failure results in the lack of recognition of data as an asset and insufficient commitment to quality management.

**Key barriers to effective data quality management**:

1. Lack of awareness among leaders and employees
2. Poor governance
3. Lack of leadership and management skills
4. Difficulty justifying improvements
5. Ineffective or inappropriate measurement tools

#### (2) Data Input Process Issues

1. Problems with data entry interfaces
2. Improper placement of list entries
3. Field overloading
4. Inadequate training
5. Changes in business processes
6. Disorderly execution of business processes

#### (3) Data Processing Function Issues

1. Incorrect assumptions about data sources
2. Outdated business rules
3. Changed data structures

#### (4) System Design Issues

1. Failure to enforce referential integrity, leading to:
    - Duplicate data that violates uniqueness constraints
    - Orphaned data included or excluded in reports, causing multiple calculation results
    - Inability to upgrade due to restored or changed referential integrity requirements
    - Loss of accuracy when missing data is assigned default values
2. Failure to enforce uniqueness constraints
3. Coding inaccuracies and discrepancies
4. Inaccurate data models
5. Field overloading
6. Mismatched time data
7. Weak master data management
8. Harmful data duplication, including:
    - Single source with multiple local instances
    - Multiple sources with a single local instance

### Data Profiling

**Data Profiling** is a form of data analysis used to examine and assess data quality. It employs statistical techniques to uncover the true structure, content, and quality of datasets. Key components of data profiling include:

- **Statistical Information Identification**
    - Cross-column analysis
    - Inter-table analysis
    - Additional forms of analysis for problem resolution

**Common issues identified through statistical information**:

1. **Number of Null Values**: Identifies the presence of null values and verifies whether nulls are allowed.
2. **Maximum/Minimum Values**: Detects outliers, such as negative values.
3. **Maximum/Minimum Length**: Identifies invalid or anomalous values in fields with specific length requirements.
4. **Frequency Distribution of Single Column Values**: Assesses reasonableness.
5. **Data Types and Formats**: Ensures adherence to predefined formats and standards.

### Data Quality and Data Processing

Data quality can be improved through specific forms of data processing. The main approaches include:

#### 1. **Data Cleaning**

Transform data to meet data standards and domain rules, detecting and correcting errors to achieve acceptable quality levels.

- Implement controls to prevent data entry errors.
- Correct data at the source system.
- Improve business processes for data entry.
- Midstream system corrections are often more cost-effective.

#### 2. **Data Enrichment**

Enhances datasets by adding attributes to improve quality and usability. Examples:

1. **Timestamps**: Track historical events and identify issue timeframes.
2. **Audit Data**: Records data lineage for historical tracking and validation.
3. **Reference Glossary**: Enhances understanding and control through business-specific terms and vocabularies.
4. **Contextual Information**: Provides context for review and analysis.
5. **Geographic Information**: Adds value through address standardization and geocoding.
6. **Demographic Information**: Enhances customer data with attributes like age, marital status, gender, income, or ethnicity.
7. **Psychographic Information**: Segments target populations by behaviors, habits, or preferences, e.g., product preferences, memberships, recreational activities.
8. **Assessment Information**: Applies to asset valuation, inventory, or sales data.

#### 3. **Data Parsing and Formatting**

Interprets data content or values using predefined rules. Data quality tools standardize data values to simplify evaluation, similarity analysis, and remediation.

- Parses data into meaningful components and formats it for consistency.
- Example: Formatting phone numbers into area codes, exchange codes, and terminal codes.

#### 4. **Data Transformation and Standardization**

Maps raw data values to target representations using rule-based transformations. Parsed components are rearranged, corrected, or modified per knowledge base rules.

### Activities in Data Quality Management

#### **Activity 1: Define High-Quality Data**

1. Evaluate seven key questions:
    
    - What does "high-quality data" mean?
