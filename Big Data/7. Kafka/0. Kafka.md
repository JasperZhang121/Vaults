### Definition

Kafka is a distributed message queue based on the publish/subscribe model, primarily used in the field of real-time big data processing.

### Message Queue

#### Application Scenarios of Traditional Message Queues

**Benefits of Using Message Queues:**

1. **Decoupling:**
   Message queues allow you to independently scale or modify processing on either side, as long as both sides adhere to the same interface constraints.

2. **Recoverability:**
   When a component of the system fails, it doesnâ€™t affect the entire system. Message queues reduce the coupling between processes, so even if a process handling messages crashes, the messages in the queue can still be processed when the system recovers.

3. **Buffering:**
   It helps to control and optimize the flow of data through the system, resolving discrepancies in the processing speed between producing and consuming messages.

4. **Flexibility & Peak Handling Capacity:**
   Applications need to remain functional even under a sudden surge in traffic, although such traffic spikes are often rare. Allocating resources to handle peak traffic at all times would be wasteful. Using a message queue allows critical components to withstand peak traffic without collapsing due to sudden overloads.

5. **Asynchronous Communication:**
   Often, users do not want or need to process messages immediately. Message queues provide an asynchronous processing mechanism, allowing users to place a message in the queue without processing it immediately. You can place as many messages in the queue as needed and process them later.

#### Two Modes of Message Queues

1. **Point-to-Point Model** (One-to-One, Consumer Actively Pulls Data, Message is Cleared After Receipt):
   - The message producer sends messages to a Queue.
   - The message consumer retrieves and consumes messages from the Queue.
   - Once consumed, the message is removed from the Queue, meaning other consumers cannot consume the same message.
   - The Queue supports multiple consumers, but each message is only consumed by one consumer.

2. **Publish/Subscribe Model** (One-to-Many, Consumers Do Not Clear Messages After Consumption):
   - The message producer (publisher) publishes messages to a Topic.
   - Multiple message consumers (subscribers) consume the message.
   - Unlike the point-to-point model, messages published to a Topic are consumed by all subscribers.

### Kafka Basic Architecture

1. **Producer:** 
   - The message producer is the client that sends messages to the Kafka broker.

2. **Consumer:** 
   - The message consumer is the client that retrieves messages from the Kafka broker.

3. **Consumer Group (CG):** 
   - A consumer group consists of multiple consumers.
   - Each consumer within a group is responsible for consuming data from different partitions.
   - A partition can only be consumed by one consumer within a group.
   - Consumer groups do not affect each other.
   - All consumers belong to a consumer group, meaning the consumer group acts as a logical subscriber.

4. **Broker:** 
   - A Kafka server is referred to as a broker.
   - A Kafka cluster is made up of multiple brokers.
   - A single broker can host multiple topics.

5. **Topic:** 
   - A topic can be understood as a queue, which is the main point of interaction between producers and consumers.

6. **Partition:** 
   - To achieve scalability, a very large topic can be distributed across multiple brokers (i.e., servers).
   - A topic can be divided into multiple partitions, with each partition being an ordered queue.

7. **Replica:** 
   - Replicas ensure data is not lost when a node in the cluster fails and that Kafka continues to function.
   - Kafka uses a replication mechanism where each partition of a topic has several replicas: one leader and multiple followers.

8. **Leader:** 
   - The leader is the "primary" among the replicas of a partition.
   - Both producers sending data and consumers consuming data interact with the leader.

9. **Follower:** 
   - Followers are replicas that synchronize data from the leader in real-time to maintain consistency.
   - If the leader fails, one of the followers becomes the new leader.
