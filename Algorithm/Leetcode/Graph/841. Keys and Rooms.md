There are `n` rooms labeled from `0` to `n - 1` and all the rooms are locked except for room `0`. Your goal is to visit all the rooms. However, you cannot enter a locked room without having its key.

When you visit a room, you may find a set of **distinct keys** in it. Each key has a number on it, denoting which room it unlocks, and you can take all of them with you to unlock the other rooms.

Given an array `rooms` where `rooms[i]` is the set of keys that you can obtain if you visited room `i`, return `true` _if you can visit **all** the rooms, or_ `false` _otherwise_.

```python
class Solution:
    def canVisitAllRooms(self, rooms: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        
        g, v = defaultdict(), set()
        for i in range(len(rooms)):
            g[i] = rooms[i]
            
        
        def dfs(node,count=set(),visited=set()):
            temp = False
            if len(count) == len(rooms):
                return True
            for x in g[node]:
                if x not in visited:
                    count.add(x)
                    visited.add(x)
                    temp = temp or dfs(x,count)
            return temp
        
        count = set([0])
        v = set([0])
        return dfs(0,count,v)
