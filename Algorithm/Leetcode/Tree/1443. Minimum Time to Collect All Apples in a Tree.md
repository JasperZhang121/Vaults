Given an undirected tree consisting of `n` vertices numbered from `0` to `n-1`, which has some apples in their vertices. You spend 1 second to walk over one edge of the tree. _Return the minimum time in seconds you have to spend to collect all apples in the tree, starting at **vertex 0** and coming back to this vertex._

The edges of the undirected tree are given in the array `edges`, where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` means that exists an edge connecting the vertices `ai` and `bi`. Additionally, there is a boolean array `hasApple`, where `hasApple[i] = true` means that vertex `i` has an apple; otherwise, it does not have any apple.

```python
class Solution:
    def minTime(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]], hasApple: List[bool]) -> int:

        tree = defaultdict(list)
        for s,e in edges:
            tree[s].append(e)
            tree[e].append(s)
        
        def dfs(node,par):
            
            res = 0
            for nei in tree[node]:
                if nei != par:
                    res += dfs(nei,node)
            
            if res or hasApple[node]:
                return res + 2

            return res

        return max(dfs(0,-1)-2, 0)
```
