You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day, and an integer `fee` representing a transaction fee.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you like, but you need to pay the transaction fee for each transaction.

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int], fee: int) -> int:
        
        dp = {}
        
        def dfs(i,buying):
            if i >=len(prices): return 0
            if (i,buying) in dp:
                return dp[(i,buying)]
            
            if buying:
                buy = dfs(i+1,not buying) - prices[i]
                cool = dfs(i+1,buying)
                dp[(i,buying)] = max (buy,cool) 
                
            else:
                sell = dfs(i+1, not buying) + prices[i] - fee
                cool = dfs (i+1, buying)
                dp[(i,buying)] = max (sell,cool) 
                
            return dp[(i,buying)]
            
        return dfs(0,True)
