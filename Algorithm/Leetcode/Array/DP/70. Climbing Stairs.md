You are climbing a staircase. It takes `n` steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb `1` or `2` steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

```python
class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n==1: return 1
        
        dp = [None]*(n+1); dp[1]=1; dp[2] = 2
         
        for i in range(3,n+1):
            dp[i] = dp[i-1]+dp[i-2]
        
        return dp[n]
```
