You are the manager of a basketball team. For the upcoming tournament, you want to choose the team with the highest overall score. The score of the team is the **sum** of scores of all the players in the team.

However, the basketball team is not allowed to have **conflicts**. A **conflict** exists if a younger player has a **strictly higher** score than an older player. A conflict does **not** occur between players of the same age.

Given two lists, `scores` and `ages`, where each `scores[i]` and `ages[i]` represents the score and age of the `ith` player, respectively, return _the highest overall score of all possible basketball teams_.

```python
class Solution:
    def bestTeamScore(self, scores: List[int], ages: List[int]) -> int:
        
        pairs = [[scores[i],ages[i]] for i in range(len(scores))]
        pairs.sort()
        dp = [pairs[i][0] for i in range(len(pairs))]
        
        for i in range(len(pairs)):
            ms, ma = pairs[i]
            for j in range(i):
                s,a = pairs[j]
                if ma>=a:
                    dp[i] = max(dp[i],ms+dp[j])
                
        
        return max(dp)
```
