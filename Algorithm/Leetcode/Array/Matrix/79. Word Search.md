Given an `m x n` grid of characters `board` and a string `word`, return `true` _if_ `word` _exists in the grid_.

The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where adjacent cells are horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once.

```Java
class Solution:
    def exist(self, board: List[List[str]], word: str) -> bool:
        
        def helper(i,j,word,start,board):
            if start>=len(word):
                return True
            if i<0 or i>=len(board) or j<0 or j>=len(board[0]):
                return False
            if board[i][j]==word[start]:
                start+=1
                c = board[i][j]
                board[i][j] = '#'
                res = helper(i-1,j,word,start,board) or helper(i+1,j,word,start,board) or helper(i,j-1,word,start,board) or helper(i,j+1,word,start,board)
                board[i][j]=c
                return res
            return False
        
        for i in range(len(board)):
            for j in range(len(board[0])):
                if helper(i,j,word,0,board):
                    return True
        return False
```

For each cell, tries to match the word by DFS into its 4 neighbors (marking cells as visited), the complexities are:

- **Time complexity:**  
    Let m,n be the grid dimensions and L = word.length. In the worst case you start a DFS from every cell (m·n choices), and at each step of the DFS you branch into up to 4 directions, to depth L. So the total is bounded by
    
    $$O\bigl(mn \times 4^L\bigr)$$
    
    (In practice you prune once characters don’t match, but the worst‐case exponential behavior remains.)
    
- **Space complexity:**
    
    - **Auxiliary/recursion:** the DFS goes at most L levels deep ⇒ O(L) for the call stack.
        
    - **Visited markers:** you typically maintain an m×n boolean array (or modify in-place and revert) ⇒ O(mn).  
        So overall auxiliary space is
 $$   O(mn+L)$$
    
    which for large grids is dominated by O(mn).
