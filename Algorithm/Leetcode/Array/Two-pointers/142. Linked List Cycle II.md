Given the `head` of a linked list, return _the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return_ `null`.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to (**0-indexed**). It is `-1` if there is no cycle. **Note that** `pos` **is not passed as a parameter**.

**Do not modify** the linked list.

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode *detectCycle(ListNode *head) {
        
        ListNode *slow = head, *fast = head;
        
        do{
            if (!fast || !fast->next) return nullptr;
            fast = fast->next->next;
            slow = slow->next;
            
        }while(fast!=slow); // when first time meets, put fast at head
        
        fast = head;
        while (fast!=slow){ // when second time meets, meeting point is the start of the loop
            slow = slow->next;
            fast = fast->next;
        }
        return fast;
    }
};
```
