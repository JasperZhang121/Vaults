Given an integer array `nums` of length `n` and an integer `target`, find three integers in `nums` such that the sum is closest to `target`.

Return _the sum of the three integers_.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

```python
class Solution:
    def threeSumClosest(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:

        diff = float("inf")
        nums.sort()
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            
            l,r = i+1,len(nums)-1
            
            while l<r:
                sum = nums[i] + nums[l] + nums[r]
                if abs(target - sum) < abs(diff):
                    diff = target - sum
                if sum < target:
                    l += 1
                else:
                    r -= 1
            if diff == 0:
                break   
        return target-diff
```
