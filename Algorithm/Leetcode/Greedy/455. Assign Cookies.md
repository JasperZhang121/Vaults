Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie.

Each child `i` has a greed factor `g[i]`, which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie `j` has a size `s[j]`. If `s[j] >= g[i]`, we can assign the cookie `j` to the child `i`, and the child `i` will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int findContentChildren(vector<int>& g, vector<int>& s) {
        sort(g.begin(),g.end());
        sort(s.begin(),s.end());
        int child = 0 , cookies = 0;
        while ( child<g.size() && cookies < s.size() ){
            if (g[child]<=s[cookies]) ++child;
            ++cookies;
        }
        return child;
    }
};
```
