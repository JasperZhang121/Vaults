Iterative deepening search (IDS) is a search algorithm that combines the benefits of depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS). It is a brute-force search algorithm that systematically searches for a goal node by incrementally increasing the maximum depth limit of DFS until a goal node is found. The algorithm performs DFS to a maximum depth limit in a loop until a goal node is found or the maximum depth limit is reached, then it increases the maximum depth limit by 1 and performs another DFS iteration. This process continues until a goal node is found or the entire search space has been explored.

IDS is complete, meaning that it is guaranteed to find a solution if one exists, and optimal, meaning that it will find the shortest path to the goal node if it exists. However, the time complexity of IDS is still exponential in the worst case, although it is more efficient than BFS in terms of space complexity because it only stores a single path at any given time.
