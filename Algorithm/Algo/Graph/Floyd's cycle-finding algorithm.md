- [[142. Linked List Cycle II]]

---

### Explantion:

The algorithm works by using two pointers, one that moves one step at a time (the "slow" pointer) and another that moves two steps at a time (the "fast" pointer). If there is a cycle in the linked list, eventually the fast pointer will catch up to the slow pointer, indicating the presence of a cycle.

Here's how the algorithm works in more detail:

1.  Initialize the slow and fast pointers to the first node in the linked list.
    
2.  While the fast pointer is not null and the node it points to is not the same as the slow pointer: a. Move the slow pointer one step forward. b. Move the fast pointer two steps forward.
    
3.  If the fast pointer becomes null, then there is no cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, there is a cycle, and the slow and fast pointers have met at a node in the cycle.

Here's some sample code that implements the Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm in Python:

```python
def has_cycle(head):
    if head is None:
        return False
    
    slow = head
    fast = head.next
    
    while fast is not None and fast.next is not None:
        if slow == fast:
            return True
        
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next
    
    return False
```

In this code, `head` is the first node of the linked list, and the `has_cycle` function returns `True` if there is a cycle in the linked list, and `False` otherwise. The algorithm runs in O(n) time, where n is the length of the linked list.
