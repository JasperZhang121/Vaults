In the alpha-beta pruning algorithm, when we are trying to minimize the potential search space, we keep track of two variables: alpha and beta. Alpha represents the best option for the maximizing player so far, and beta represents the best option for the minimizing player so far.

When we are evaluating a node and we are in the maximizing player's turn, if the current alpha value is greater than or equal to the current beta value, we stop evaluating that node and any subsequent nodes, because we know that the minimizing player has already found a better move in a previous branch.

This may seem counterintuitive at first, because we're using the alpha variable (associated with the maximizing player) to determine when to cut off the search, instead of the beta variable (associated with the minimizing player). However, this is simply a clever trick that allows us to save computational resources while still finding the optimal move. By considering alpha as the upper bound for the maximizing player, we can eliminate entire subtrees of the game tree that we know will not yield a better outcome than what has already been found.

-   Alpha-Beta Pruning is a search algorithm commonly used in game theory to improve the efficiency of the Minimax algorithm.
-   It works by pruning branches in the game tree that are guaranteed to be worse than previously explored branches, thereby reducing the number of nodes that need to be explored.
-   The algorithm keeps track of two values, alpha and beta, which represent the best score the maximizing player (alpha) and the minimizing player (beta) can achieve respectively.
-   As the algorithm explores the game tree, it updates these values and uses them to prune branches that are guaranteed to lead to worse scores.
-   The algorithm is called Alpha-Beta because alpha represents the best score for the maximizing player found so far and beta represents the best score for the minimizing player found so far.
-   By using Alpha-Beta Pruning, we can potentially reduce the number of nodes that need to be explored, which can greatly improve the efficiency of the Minimax algorithm, especially when the game tree is very large.

```python
def minimax_alpha_beta(node, depth, alpha, beta, maximizing_player):
    # Check if the maximum depth is reached or the node is terminal
    if depth == 0 or node.is_terminal():
        return node.evaluate(), None
    
    # Maximizing player's turn
    if maximizing_player:
        max_val = float('-inf')
        best_child = None
        for child in node.generate_children():
            child_val, _ = minimax_alpha_beta(child, depth - 1, alpha, beta, False)
            if child_val > max_val:
                max_val = child_val
                best_child = child
            alpha = max(alpha, max_val)
            if beta <= alpha:
                break
        return max_val, best_child
    
    # Minimizing player's turn
    else:
        min_val = float('inf')
        best_child = None
        for child in node.generate_children():
            child_val, _ = minimax_alpha_beta(child, depth - 1, alpha, beta, True)
            if child_val < min_val:
                min_val = child_val
                best_child = child
            beta = min(beta, min_val)
            if beta <= alpha:
                break
        return min_val, best_child
```

The `node` parameter represents the current state of the game or problem, and the `generate_children()` method should be implemented to generate all possible next states. The `is_terminal()` method should be implemented to check if a state is terminal, and the `evaluate()` method should be implemented to evaluate the utility of a terminal state. The `maximizing_player` parameter should be set to `True` if the current player is maximizing, and `False` if the current player is minimizing. The `alpha` and `beta` parameters are used for pruning, and should be initialized to `-inf` and `inf`, respectively, at the root node.
