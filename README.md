# Computer Science Vaults

_Compiled notes covering all aspects of computer science that I am familiar with. These notes are being backed up automatically using Obsidian with git configuration, a note-taking software application.__

## Status Update

_I am currently rearranging files, which may result in a disorganized display of the repository.__

## Issues

_Some images shown in the notes by Obsidian may not appear in the GitHub repository due to differences in the reference style used in Obsidian and GitHub. I plan to resolve this issue by May 2023.__

## Last Update

_Readme last updated on 20/04/2023._
