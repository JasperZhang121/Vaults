# Computer Science Vaults

_Compiled notes covering all aspects of computer science that I am familiar with. These notes are being backed up automatically using Obsidian with git configuration, a note-taking software application._

_If you are an Obsidian user, you can import my notes, where you will find highlighted sentences, and view all referenced images or jump to other links within notes more easily. Hope this can be beneficial to your learning journey._

## Status Update

~~_I am currently rearranging files, which may result in a disorganized display of the repository._~~

## Issues

- _Some Images shown/referenced in the notes by Obsidian may not appear in the GitHub repository due to differences in the reference style used in Obsidian and markdown._
- ~~_As a result of a reorganization, the references to this repository in other repositories have been disrupted. However, I plan to rectify this issue by the end of April 2023._~~
