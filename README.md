# Computer Science Vaults

_Compiled notes covering all aspects of computer science that I am familiar with. These notes are being backed up automatically using Obsidian with git configuration, a note-taking software application._

_If you are an Obsidian user, you can import my notes, where you will find highlighted sentences using HTML tags in each file. Hope this can be beneficial to your learning journey._

## Status Update

~~_I am currently rearranging files, which may result in a disorganized display of the repository._~~

## Issues

- ~_Some images shown in the notes by Obsidian may not appear in the GitHub repository due to differences in the reference style used in Obsidian and markdown. I plan to resolve this issue by May 2023._~
- ~~_As a result of a reorganization, the references to this repository in other repositories have been disrupted. However, I plan to rectify this issue by the end of April 2023._~~
