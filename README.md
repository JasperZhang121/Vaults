# Computer Science Vaults

_Compiled notes covering all aspects of computer science that I am familiar with. These notes are being backed up automatically using Obsidian with git configuration, a note-taking software application._

## Status Update

_I am currently rearranging files, which may result in a disorganized display of the repository._

## Issues

- _Some images shown in the notes by Obsidian may not appear in the GitHub repository due to differences in the reference style used in Obsidian and markdown. I plan to resolve this issue by May 2023._
- _As a result of a reorganization, the references to this repository in other repositories have been disrupted. However, I plan to rectify this issue by the end of April 2023._
