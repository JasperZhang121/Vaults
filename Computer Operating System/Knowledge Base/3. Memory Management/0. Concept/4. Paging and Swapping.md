Paging and swapping are two mechanisms used in modern operating systems to manage memory. They allow the operating system to divide memory into smaller chunks, known as pages or page frames, and move them between main memory and secondary storage as needed.

## Paging

Paging is a memory management technique that divides the physical memory of a computer into fixed-size pages. The operating system keeps track of which pages are currently in main memory and which are stored on disk. When a process needs to access a page that is not in main memory, the operating system uses a page fault to bring that page into main memory from disk.

Advantages of paging:

-   Increased flexibility in memory management
-   Improved utilization of available memory resources
-   Ability to share pages between processes
-   Protection of processes from each other by isolating their pages in separate address spaces

## Swapping

Swapping is a memory management technique that involves transferring an entire process from main memory to disk when there is not enough free memory available to accommodate it. The process is then resumed when memory becomes available, or when it is next scheduled to run.

Advantages of swapping:

-   Ability to accommodate larger numbers of processes than would be possible with a fixed-sized main memory
-   Improved utilization of disk storage
-   Ability to move inactive or low-priority processes to disk to free up memory for higher-priority processes.

Both paging and swapping are commonly used in modern operating systems to manage memory effectively, providing the operating system with the ability to adapt to changing memory demands.
