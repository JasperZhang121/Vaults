Address Translation is a process used in computer architecture to map virtual addresses used by a program to physical addresses in the computer's main memory. This is an essential aspect of memory management in operating systems, as it allows multiple processes to run simultaneously on a computer without interfering with each other's memory usage.

## Virtual Memory

Virtual Memory is a feature of an operating system that enables a computer to be able to compensate for shortages of physical memory by temporarily transferring pages of data from random access memory (RAM) to disk storage. This enables a program to run larger amounts of data or execute more complex operations than the physical memory available would allow.

## Page Table

The Page Table is a data structure that is used to map virtual addresses to physical addresses. Each process has its own page table, which is stored in main memory and is used by the processor to determine the physical address for each virtual address referenced by the process.

## Address Translation Hardware

The Address Translation Hardware is a component of the computer's processor that performs the actual address translation from virtual to physical addresses. It uses the page table to perform the translation, and the results are stored in a Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) to speed up the translation process.

## Page Fault

A Page Fault is an event that occurs when a process references a virtual address that is not currently mapped to a physical address. The operating system's memory manager detects the page fault and resolves it by bringing the required page into physical memory and updating the page table. This process is known as demand paging and is an important aspect of virtual memory management.

## Absolute Load (Single Program Phase, No Operating System)

When loading, the program and data are loaded into memory according to their actual memory addresses.

**Advantages:**

-   No need to modify the addresses of programs and data

**Disadvantages:**

-   Only suitable for single program environments


## Relocatable Load (Static Relocation) (Early Multibatch Phase)

At this stage, relative addresses of modules are used, and then the program and data are loaded into memory. The process of modifying instructions and data in the target program during loading is called relocation, and address translation is usually performed only once during loading. It is also known as static relocation.

**Features:**

-   Jobs must be loaded all at once
-   Running jobs cannot be moved in memory
-   Jobs cannot apply for memory space


## Dynamic Runtime Loading (Dynamic Relocation) (Modern Operating Systems)

After the loader loads the load module into memory, the relative addresses in the load module are not immediately converted to absolute addresses. Instead, address translation is performed when the program is actually executed.

**Features:**

-   Requires relocation registers
-   Programs can be assigned to discontinuous storage areas, which facilitates the sharing of program segments.
-   Provides users with a larger address space (address space is larger than storage space)
