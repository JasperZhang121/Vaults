<span style="color:yellow">The Address Space:</span>
The address space of a process contains all of the memory state of the running program. For example, the code of the program (the instructions) have to live in memory somewhere, and thus they are in the address space.

The program, while it is running, uses a stack to keep track of where it is in the function call chain as well as to allocate local variables and pass parameters and return values to and from routines. Finally, the heap is used for dynamically-allocated, user-managed memory, such as that you might receive from a call to malloc() in C or new in an objectoriented language such as C++ or Java.

However, this placement of stack and heap is just a convention; you could arrange the address space in a different way if you’d like.

When the OS does this, we say the OS is virtualizing memory, because the running program thinks it is loaded into memory at a particular address (say 0) and has a potentially very large address space (say 32-bits or 64-bits); the reality is quite different.

All memory is vitural, not real:
```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
	printf("location of code: %p\n", (void*)main);
	printf("location of heap: %p\n", (void*)malloc(1));
	int x = 3;
	printf("location of code: %p\n", (void*) &x);

	return 0;
}
```


<span style="color:yellow">Memory API :</span>

stack memory: allocations and deallocations of it are managed implicitly by the compiler for you, the programmer; for this reason it is sometimes called automatic memory.

```C
void func() {
	int x; 
	// declares an integer on the stack ... 
}
```

The compiler does the rest, making sure to make space on the stack when you call into func(). When your return from the function, the compiler deallocates the memory for you; thus, if you want some information to live beyond the call invocation, you had better not leave that information on the stack.

<br/>
heap memory: allocations and deallocations are explicitly handled by you, the programmer.

It is this need for long-lived memory that gets us to the second type of memory, called heap memory,where all allocations and deallocations are explicitly handled by you, the programmer.

```C
void func() { 
	int *x = (int *) malloc(sizeof(int)); 
}
```

<span style="color:yellow">The malloc() Call :</span>
The malloc() call is quite simple: you pass it a size asking for some room on the heap, and it either succeeds and gives you back a pointer to the newly-allocated space, or fails and returns NULL.

You might also notice that malloc() returns a pointer to type void. Doing so is just the way in C to pass back an address and let the programmer decide what to do with it. The programmer further helps out by using what is called a cast.

The free() Call:
As it turns out, allocating memory is the easy part of the equation; knowing when, how, and even if to free memory is the hard part. To free heap memory that is no longer in use, programmers simply call free():

```C
int *x = malloc(10 * sizeof(int));
... 
free(x);
```

Correct memory management has been such a problem, in fact, that many newer languages have support for automatic memory management. In such languages, while you call something akin to malloc() to allocate memory (usually new or something similar to allocate a new object), you never have to call something to free space; rather, a garbage collector runs and figures out what memory you no longer have references to and frees it for you.

Memory leak: 
it occurs when you forget to free memory. In long-running applications or systems (such as the OS itself), this is a huge problem, as slowly leaking memory eventually leads one to run out of memory, at which point a restart is required. Thus, in general, when you are done with a chunk of memory, you should make sure to free it.

Other Calls:
There are a few other calls that the memory-allocation library supports. For example, calloc() allocates memory and also zeroes it before returning; this prevents some errors where you assume that memory is zeroed and forget to initialize it yourself (see the paragraph on “uninitialized reads” above). The routine realloc() can also be useful, when you’ve allocated space for something (say, an array), and then need to add something to it: realloc() makes a new larger region of memory, copies the old region into it, and returns the pointer to the new region.

<span style="color:yellow">Free-Space Management :</span>

External fragmentation: the free space gets chopped into little pieces of different sizes and is thus fragmented; subsequent requests may fail because there is no single contiguous space that can satisfy the request, even though the total amount of free space exceeds the size of the request.
Allocators could of course also have the problem of internal fragmentation.
