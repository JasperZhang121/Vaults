Scheduling level refers to the various levels at which a scheduling algorithm can operate within a computer system. There are typically four levels of scheduling:

1.  Processor Scheduling: This level of scheduling is performed by the operating system within a single processor system. The operating system uses scheduling algorithms to determine which process should be executed next.
    
2.  Medium-term Scheduling: This level of scheduling is performed by the operating system in a multiprocessor system. The operating system uses medium-term scheduling algorithms to determine which process should be swapped in or out of main memory.
    
3.  Long-term Scheduling: This level of scheduling is performed by the operating system in a batch processing system. The operating system uses long-term scheduling algorithms to determine which processes should be executed and when.
    
4.  Job Scheduling: This level of scheduling is performed by the operating system in a batch processing system. The operating system uses job scheduling algorithms to determine which jobs should be executed and in what order.
    

The selection of a scheduling algorithm and the scheduling level at which it is used depend on the specific requirements of the operating system and the computer system it is running on. Some operating systems use multiple scheduling algorithms at different levels to optimize system performance.
