The relationship between scheduling algorithms and scheduling levels can be understood as follows:

Scheduling algorithms are the methods used to determine which process to allocate the CPU to next. These algorithms can be categorized into different levels, depending on their scope of operation. The scheduling levels refer to the different levels at which processes can be scheduled.

-   Low-level scheduling (or CPU scheduling) is the process of determining which process should run next on the CPU. This level of scheduling typically operates within the context of a single operating system and is concerned with assigning processes to individual CPU cores.
    
-   Medium-level scheduling (or multiprocessor scheduling) is the process of determining which process should run on which processor. This level of scheduling operates across multiple processors and is concerned with balancing the load across different processors.
    
-   High-level scheduling (or process scheduling) is the process of determining which process should run next in a larger context, such as across multiple systems. This level of scheduling is concerned with determining the order in which processes should run in order to meet performance goals.
    

Each scheduling level may use different algorithms to make its scheduling decisions. For example, a low-level scheduler may use a priority-based algorithm, while a medium-level scheduler may use a load-balancing algorithm. The choice of scheduling algorithm depends on the requirements of the system and the goals of the scheduler.

In general, the relationship between scheduling algorithms and scheduling levels can be seen as a hierarchical relationship, with lower-level scheduling algorithms providing input to higher-level scheduling algorithms.

Example:
```C
#include <pthread.h>
#include <semaphore.h>

sem_t semaphore;

void *thread_function(void *arg)
{
    sem_wait(&semaphore);
    /* critical section */
    sem_post(&semaphore);
}

int main(void)
{
    sem_init(&semaphore, 0, 1);
    pthread_t thread;
    pthread_create(&thread, NULL, &thread_function, NULL);
    /* wait for thread to finish */
    pthread_join(thread, NULL);
    sem_destroy(&semaphore);
    return 0;
}
```

Process Mutual Exclusion is realized through the use of synchronization primitives such as semaphores, locks, monitors, and message passing. Semaphores are a simple and widely used method for implementing mutual exclusion.

In the example code provided, the semaphore is initialized using `sem_init()` with the second argument set to 0 (indicating that the semaphore is shared between threads within a single process) and the third argument set to 1 (indicating that the semaphore starts with a value of 1, allowing one thread to enter the critical section).

The `thread_function()` waits on the semaphore using `sem_wait()` before entering the critical section. This ensures that only one thread can enter the critical section at a time. The `sem_post()` function is then used to release the semaphore, allowing another thread to enter the critical section.

The main function creates a new thread using `pthread_create()` and then waits for the thread to finish using `pthread_join()`. The semaphore is destroyed using `sem_destroy()` when the program terminates.

By using the semaphore to manage access to the critical section, the program ensures that only one thread can execute the critical section at a time, avoiding race conditions and ensuring the mutual exclusion of processes.
