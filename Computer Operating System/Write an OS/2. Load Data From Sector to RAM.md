1. Set the running environment: MBR

```assembly

; set environment for bootloader to run

LOADER_BASE_ADDR	equ 0x900     ; expect loader to be put at 0x900
LOADER_START_SECTOR	equ 0x2       ; define symbolic constant

	mov ax,cs
	mov ds,ax
	mov es,ax
	mov ss,ax
	mov fs,ax
	mov sp,0x7c00              ; set the stack pointer starts ox7c00 
	mov ax,0xb800
	mov gs,ax
	

	mov ax, 0600h
	mov bx, 0700h
	mov cx,0
	mov dx,184fh ;(80,25)
	
	int 10h                      ; display


	mov byte [gs:0x00], '1'        ; store in gs + 0x00
	mov byte [gs:0x01], 0xA4

	mov eax,LOADER_START_SECTOR    ; starting sector to read 
	mov bx,LOADER_BASE_ADDR       ; specify base address to read		
	mov cx,1                        ; specify number of sector to read 					
	call rd_disk           ; read specified sector from starting and put it in base
	
	jmp LOADER_BASE_ADDR          ; jump to the address		

rd_disk:
	
	mov esi,eax		       ; esi is the source pointer for data movement
	mov di,cx		       ; di is the destination pointer 
	

	mov dx, 0x1f2          ; set the content of DX register to I/O port address
	mov al, cl
	out dx, al
	mov eax,esi

	mov dx, 0x1f3
	out dx,al
	

	mov cl,8
	shr eax,cl
	mov dx,0x1f4
	out dx,al
	

	shr eax,cl
	mov dx,0x1f5
	out dx,al
	
	shr eax,cl
	and al,0x0f
	or al,0xe0	
	mov dx,0x1f6
	out dx,al
	
	mov dx,0x1f7
	mov al,0x20
	out dx,al
	

	.not_ready:             ; define a label named "not_ready"
	nop                     ; no operation
	in al,dx
	and al,0x88; 
	cmp al,0x08
	jnz .not_ready
	

	mov ax,di
	mov dx, 256
	mul dx
	mov cx,ax
	mov dx,0x1f0
	
	.go_on:                   ; loop
		in ax,dx
		mov [bx],ax
		add bx,2
		loop .go_on           ; decrease if cx not 0 and jump to .go_on
		ret
	
	times 510 - ($-$$)	db 0
	dw 0xaa55
```


2. Bootloader to run:

```assembly
LOADER_BASE_ADDR equ 0x900
section loader vstart=LOADER_BASE_ADDR

mov ax, 0xb800
mov es, ax 

mov byte [es:0x00],'o'
mov byte [es:0x01],0x07
mov byte [es:0x02],'k'
mov byte [es:0x03],0x06

jmp $
```

It is generally better to load the operating system from the second sector (LBA 1) rather than the first sector (LBA 0) of a disk because the first sector is typically reserved for storing the Master Boot Record (MBR). The MBR contains important information such as the disk's partition table and the location of the boot loader, which is used to load the operating system. Loading the operating system from the second sector allows you to keep the MBR intact, ensuring that the disk remains bootable even if the operating system is overwritten.

The Master Boot Record (MBR) is the first sector of a hard drive. It contains the boot loader code and a table of the partitions on the drive. The MBR is responsible for booting the operating system, it locates the active partition, loads the boot loader and passes control to it. The MBR is a crucial part of the boot process and must be protected from damage or corruption to ensure the stability of the system.

Steps in the boot process of an x86-based computer:

1.  Power on: The computer is powered on, and the CPU starts executing code.
    
2.  Initialization of system components: The CPU initializes the memory controller, input/output interfaces, and other system components.
    
3.  BIOS load: The CPU reads the BIOS code from the ROM chip on the motherboard and loads it into memory.
    
4.  BIOS start-up: The BIOS code initializes the system and performs a series of tests to ensure that all components are functioning correctly.
    
5.  Finding the boot device: The BIOS scans for bootable devices, such as hard drives or CD-ROMs, and reads the boot sector from the first one it finds.
    
6.  Loading boot code: The BIOS loads the boot code from the boot sector into memory and transfers control to it.
    
7.  Loading the operating system: The boot code loads the operating system from the boot device into memory and transfers control to it.
    
8.  Operating system start-up: The operating system initializes itself, loads drivers, and starts executing its code.
