Use dd, then navigate to WriteOS:
```
dd if=bootJas.bin of=d:\\jasper.vhd bs=512 count=1

NASM:

NASM (Netwide Assembler) is an open-source assembler for x86 architecture that can be used to compile assembly code into executable machine code. To compile code with NASM, you need to follow these steps:

1.  Write the Assembly Code: Write the assembly code using a text editor, such as Notepad or Sublime Text. The code should be saved with a .asm extension.
    
2.  Install NASM: You need to install NASM on your computer before you can compile your code. You can download NASM from the official website ([https://www.nasm.us/](https://www.nasm.us/)).
    
3.  Compile the Code: To compile the code, open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where your .asm file is located. Then run the following command:
    `nasm -f [format] [filename].asm`

where `format` is the format of the output file, such as `bin` for binary or `elf` for Executable and Linkable Format, and `filename` is the name of your .asm file.

4.  Link the Object Code: After compiling the code, you need to link the object code to create an executable file. You can use the `ld` linker to do this. The following command will link the object code and create an executable named `a.out`:
	`ld -s -o [executable_name] [filename].o`

where `executable_name` is the name of the executable file, and `filename` is the name of your .o file.

5.  Run the Executable: Finally, you can run the executable by typing the name of the file in the command prompt or terminal.

Note that NASM is a low-level assembler, and is typically used for writing system-level software, such as bootloaders or operating systems.
