### 1. Install Git on your CentOS Server

First, install Git if it is not already installed. Run the following command:

```bash
sudo yum install git -y
```

To confirm Git is installed correctly, check the version:

```bash
git --version
```

### 2. Configure Git

Next, set up your global Git username and email, which will be used in your commits:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

You can verify the configuration with:

```bash
git config --global --list
```

### 3. Generate SSH Key 

If use SSH to authenticate with GitHub (recommended for better security), generate an SSH key on your server and add it to your GitHub account.

To generate a new SSH key:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your.email@example.com"
```

Youâ€™ll be prompted to enter a file to save the key and a passphrase. You can press `Enter` to accept the default file location and leave the passphrase blank (or enter one if you prefer extra security).

Start the SSH agent and add your SSH private key:

```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

Now, copy the contents of the public key to add it to your GitHub account:

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

Copy the output and add it to your GitHub account:
- Go to [GitHub SSH and GPG keys settings](https://github.com/settings/keys)
- Click **New SSH Key**, paste the key, and give it a title.

### 4. Clone a GitHub Repository

Once your SSH key is set up, you can clone your GitHub repository onto your server using SSH:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:your-username/your-repo.git
```

If you are using HTTPS instead of SSH:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
```

### 5. Push and Pull Changes

To push changes from your CentOS server to GitHub:

1. Navigate to the repository's folder:

```bash
cd your-repo
```

2. Make changes to your files, then add and commit them:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

3. Push the changes to GitHub:

```bash
git push origin main
```

To pull changes from the repository:

```bash
git pull origin main
```
