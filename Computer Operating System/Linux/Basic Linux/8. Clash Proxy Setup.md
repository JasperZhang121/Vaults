### Clash Proxy Setup

1. **Create and navigate to the proxy directory**  
   Begin by creating a dedicated directory for your proxy setup and navigating into it.

   ```bash
   mkdir proxy
   cd proxy/
   ```

2. **Download the Clash binary**  
   Download the Clash binary from the official release on GitHub. Replace the version with the latest if necessary.

   ```bash
   wget https://github.com/netboy1024/clash/releases/download/v1.18.0/clash-linux-amd64-v1.18.0.gz
   ```

3. **Extract and move the binary**  
   Extract the `.gz` file and move the Clash binary to `/usr/bin/` for global access.

   ```bash
   gunzip clash-linux-amd64-v1.18.0.gz
   mv clash-linux-amd64-v1.18.0 /usr/bin/clash
   ```

   Download the `Country.mmdb` file for Clash's GeoIP functionalities and move it to the Clash configuration directory.

   ```bash
   wget https://geolite.clash.dev/Country.mmdb -O ~/.config/clash/Country.mmdb
   ```

4. **Make the binary executable**  
   Ensure that the Clash binary is executable by changing its permissions.

   ```bash
   chmod +x /usr/bin/clash
   ```

5. **Download and configure the Clash config file**  
   Download a pre-configured Clash YAML file and place it in the appropriate directory. Customize the configuration by replacing its content with your subscription details.

   ```bash
   wget https://freenode.openrunner.net/uploads/20240822-clash.yaml
   mv 20240822-clash.yaml ~/.config/clash/config.yaml
   ```

6. **Run Clash and test the setup**  
   Start the Clash binary, set environment variables for HTTP/HTTPS and SOCKS5 proxies, and test your connection by checking the public IP.

   ```bash
   clash
   export https_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:7890 http_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:7890 all_proxy=socks5://127.0.0.1:7890
   curl ip.gs
   ```

7. **Run Clash as a background process**  
   Use `nohup` to run Clash in the background and log the output.

   ```bash
   nohup clash > clash.log 2>&1 &
   ```

8. **Monitor and check Clash logs**  
   Monitor the logs to ensure everything is running smoothly.

   ```bash
   tail -f clash.log
   ```

9. **Create a systemd service for Clash**  
   To enable Clash to start on boot, create a systemd service file.

   ```bash
   vim /etc/systemd/system/clash.service
   ```

```
[Unit]
Description=Clash Proxy
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/clash
Restart=always
User=<username>

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

   Add the necessary service configuration, reload the daemon, enable the service, and start it.

   ```bash
   systemctl daemon-reload
   systemctl enable clash
   systemctl start clash
   ```

10. **Check the status of the Clash service**  
    Verify the status of the Clash service to ensure it's running correctly.

    ```bash
    systemctl status clash
    ```

11. **Reboot and confirm**  
    Reboot the system to ensure Clash starts correctly on boot, and check the public IP again to confirm that the proxy is working.

    ```bash
    reboot
    curl ip.gs
    ```
