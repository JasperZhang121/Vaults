### Simple Commands

In this section, we will create a basic shell script and run it.

First, create a new script file and open it in a text editor:

```shell
touch hello.sh
vim hello.sh
```

Inside `hello.sh`, add the following script. The `#!/bin/bash` line indicates that this is a Bash script, and the `echo` command outputs "hello world" to the terminal:

```shell
#!/bin/bash
echo "hello world"
```

To run the script, simply return to the command line and execute:

```shell
bash hello.sh
```

---

### Complex Commands

Next, let's create a more complex script that changes directories, creates a file, and writes text to it.

Create a new script called `batch.sh`:

```shell
touch batch.sh
vim batch.sh
```

Inside `batch.sh`, the `cd` command moves to the specified directory, and `echo` appends a string to `batchScript.txt`:

```shell
#!/bin/bash
cd /home/hao/
touch batchScript.txt
echo "The art of command line" >> batchScript.txt
```

Run this script in the same way:

```shell
bash batch.sh
```

This script demonstrates how to use basic file handling commands in a batch process.

---

### Variables

In shell scripting, variables can store data values. Here, we show how to define and use variables:

```shell
A=2
echo $A  # Print the value of variable A
unset A  # Remove variable A from memory

readonly B=3  # Set variable B as read-only (cannot be unset)
echo $B

c=$((1+1))  # Use arithmetic expressions with double parentheses
echo $c

d="test test test"  # Assign a string to variable d
echo $d
```

#### Global Variables

The `export` command makes a variable available to any child processes started from the shell:

```shell
export D  # D becomes a global variable available to other scripts
```

---

### Positional Parameters

Bash allows the use of special variables to handle parameters passed to a script. Here's an example:

```shell
#!/bin/bash

echo "$0 $1 $2 $3"  # $0 is the script name, $1-$3 are the arguments passed

echo $#  # Number of arguments passed

echo $*  # All arguments as a single string

echo $@  # All arguments as separate strings

echo $?  # Exit status of the last command
```

This script demonstrates how to handle positional parameters and check the number of arguments or exit status.

---

### Arithmetic Operations

You can perform arithmetic in Bash using either `expr` or arithmetic expansion `$((...))`. 

```shell
#!/bin/bash

expr 3 + 2  # Simple addition using expr

expr `expr 3 + 2` \* 4  # Nested expression, note the backticks for subshell execution

s=$(( (2+3) * 4 ))  # Using arithmetic expansion to calculate
echo $s
```

Arithmetic expansion is generally preferred as it is more readable and flexible.

---

### Conditions

Conditional expressions are used to check if a statement is true or false. The exit status (`$?`) will be `0` if true and `1` if false:

```shell
#!/bin/bash

[ 23 -ge 22 ]  # Check if 23 is greater than or equal to 22
echo $?  # Print exit status (0 if true)

[ 23 -le 22 ]  # Check if 23 is less than or equal to 22
echo $?  # Print exit status (1 if false)

[ -w operator.sh ]  # Check if file is writable
echo $?

[ -e /home/hao/example ]  # Check if file exists
echo $?
```

These conditions are useful for checking files, variables, and performing comparisons.

---

### Control Flow

#### If-Else

Conditional branching with `if` statements allows you to execute different code blocks based on conditions:

```shell
#!/bin/bash

if [ $1 -eq 1 ]; then
    echo "1 equals 1"
elif [ $1 -eq 2 ]; then
    echo "2 equals 2"
else
    echo "Neither"
fi
```

This script checks the value of the first argument passed (`$1`) and executes different code depending on the value.

#### Case Statement

The `case` statement is used for pattern matching, making it a more elegant solution for handling multiple conditions:

```shell
#!/bin/bash

case $1 in
1)
    echo "It's 1"
    ;;
2)
    echo "It's 2"
    ;;
*)
    echo "Others"
    ;;
esac
```

This is often preferred for handling multiple fixed values.

---

### Loops

Loops allow you to iterate over a range of values or a list of items.

#### For Loop

A `for` loop runs a set of commands for each item in a list or range:

```shell
#!/bin/bash

s=0
for ((i=1; i<=10; i++)); do
    s=$((s+i))  # Increment the sum
    echo $s
done
```

Another example of looping through script arguments:

```shell
for i in "$@"; do
    echo "Number is $i"
done
```

#### While Loop

A `while` loop continues as long as a condition is true:

```shell
#!/bin/bash

s=0
i=0
while [ $i -le 100 ]; do
    s=$((s+i))  # Increment the sum
    i=$((i+1))  # Increment the counter
done
echo $s
```

This example sums the numbers from 0 to 100.

---

### Reading User Input

The `read` command is used to capture user input. The `-t` option specifies a timeout (in seconds), and `-p` allows for a prompt message:

```shell
#!/bin/bash

read -t 10 -p "Input something here: " sth
echo $sth  # Print the input
```

If no input is given within 10 seconds, the script will continue.

---

### Functions

#### Basename

The `basename` command strips the directory path and file extension from a file:

```shell
basename /home/hao/datas/hello.sh .sh  # Outputs: hello
```

#### Dirname

The `dirname` command extracts the directory path:

```shell
dirname /home/hao/datas/hello.sh  # Outputs: /home/hao/datas
```

#### Custom Function

You can define your own functions in Bash to encapsulate reusable logic:

```shell
#!/bin/bash

function sum() {
    s=$(( $1 + $2 ))  # Sum two numbers
    echo $s
}

read -p "Input parameter 1: " p1
read -p "Input parameter 2: " p2

sum $p1 $p2  # Call the function with the provided parameters
```

Functions are useful for breaking down large scripts into smaller, more manageable sections.

### Scheduled tasks

#### Cron Syntax Breakdown:
```
┌──────── minute (0 - 59)
│ ┌────── hour (0 - 23)
│ │ ┌──── day of the month (1 - 31)
│ │ │ ┌── month (1 - 12)
│ │ │ │ ┌─ day of the week (0 - 7) (Sunday is 0 and 7)
│ │ │ │ │
│ │ │ │ │
0 * * * * 
```

#### Making a Script Executable

Before running a script, you may need to make it executable using `chmod`:

```shell
chmod +x /path/to/your/script/shell_scripts.sh
```

#### Scheduling with Cron

To run a script automatically at a specific time, use `cron`. Edit your cron jobs with:

```shell
crontab -e
```

Add this line to run the script at 5 AM every day:

```shell
0 5 * * * AUTO_RUN=true /path/to/your/script/shell_scripts.sh >> /path/to/your/script/logfile.log 2>&1
```


#### Testing the Script

To test the script manually, you can run it as follows:

```shell
AUTO_RUN=true //path/to/your/script/shell_scripts.sh >> /path/to/your/script/logfile.log 2>&1
```
