The Descriptor Privilege Level (DPL) is a field in the descriptor table used in x86 architecture to specify the privilege level of a segment descriptor. It determines the level of privilege required to access the segment described by the descriptor.

In the x86 architecture, there are four privilege levels:

- Ring 0 (Kernel mode or Supervisor mode): The highest privilege level where the operating system kernel runs.
- Ring 1, Ring 2, and Ring 3 (User mode): Lower privilege levels where user applications and processes run.

The DPL is a 2-bit field within the segment descriptor that ranges from 0 to 3. Each segment descriptor in the Global Descriptor Table (GDT) or Local Descriptor Table (LDT) has its own DPL. When the processor performs memory access or control transfer operations, it checks the DPL of the descriptor and compares it with the current privilege level (CPL) of the executing code. Access to the segment is granted only if the CPL is less than or equal to the DPL.
