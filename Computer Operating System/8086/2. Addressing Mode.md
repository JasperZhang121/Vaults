The 8086 microprocessor supports various addressing modes, which determine how the operands for instructions are specified. 

1. Immediate addressing mode: The operand value is directly specified in the instruction itself. For example, `MOV AX, 1234h` moves the immediate value 1234h into the AX register.
    
2. Register addressing mode: The operand is stored in one of the general-purpose registers (AX, BX, CX, DX, SI, DI, BP, SP). For example, `MOV AX, BX` moves the value from the BX register into the AX register.
    
3. Direct addressing mode: The operand is accessed directly from a memory location. The address is specified directly in the instruction. For example, `MOV AX, [1234h]` moves the value from memory address 1234h into the AX register.
    
4. Indirect addressing mode: The operand is accessed indirectly through a pointer. The pointer is stored in a register or memory location. For example, `MOV AX, [BX]` moves the value from the memory location pointed to by the BX register into the AX register.
    
5. Base addressing mode: The operand is accessed using a base register (BX or BP) plus a displacement. The displacement is added to the base register value to form the effective address. For example, `MOV AX, [BX+10]` moves the value from the memory location at BX+10 into the AX register.
    
6. Index addressing mode: The operand is accessed using an index register (SI or DI) plus a displacement. The displacement is added to the index register value to form the effective address. For example, `MOV AX, [SI+5]` moves the value from the memory location at SI+5 into the AX register.
    
7. Base-index addressing mode: The operand is accessed using a combination of a base register (BX or BP), an index register (SI or DI), and a displacement. The displacement is added to the sum of the base and index register values to form the effective address. For example, `MOV AX, [BX+SI+5]` moves the value from the memory location at BX+SI+5 into the AX register.

### Physical address to a Logical address

In the 8086 microprocessor, the conversion from physical address to logical address is performed using the Memory Management Unit (MMU) and the memory segmentation mechanism.

The 8086 uses a segmented memory model, where the memory is divided into segments of 64 KB each. Each segment is identified by a segment register (CS, DS, SS, ES) which holds the segment selector. The combination of the segment selector and an offset forms a logical address.

To convert a physical address to a logical address, the following steps are typically followed:

1. Segment Base Address: Each segment register holds a segment selector which is multiplied by 16 to obtain the segment base address. This provides a starting address for the segment in the physical memory.
    
2. Offset: The offset is the actual address within the segment. It is added to the segment base address to form the physical address.
    
3. Physical Address: The segment base address and the offset are combined to form the physical address. This physical address can be used to access the memory.
    

The memory segmentation mechanism in the 8086 allows for efficient memory addressing and provides flexibility in managing memory resources. It allows programs to access more than 64 KB of memory by using different segment registers and offsets.
