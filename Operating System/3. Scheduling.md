**First In, First Out (FIFO)**: 
First In, First Out (FIFO) scheduling or sometimes First Come, First Served (FCFS).

Convoy effect: 
a number of relatively-short potential consumers of a resource get queued behind a heavyweight resource consumer.

Optimizes turnaround time:
- Shortest Job First (SJF)
- Shortest Time-to-Completion First (STCF)

Optimizes response time
- Round Robin

<span style="color:yellow">The Multi-Level Feedback Queue:</span>

Basic Rules:
- If Priority(A) > Priority(B), A runs (B doesnâ€™t).
- If Priority(A) = Priority(B), A & B run in RR.
- When a job enters the system, it is placed at the highest priority (the topmost queue).
- If a job uses up an entire time slice while running, its priority is reduced (i.e., it moves down one queue).
- If a job gives up the CPU before the time slice is up, it stays at the same priority level.
