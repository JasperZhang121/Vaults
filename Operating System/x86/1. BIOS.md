x86 BIOS

In the x86 architecture, the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) is responsible for performing various system-level functions when the computer starts up, such as initializing hardware, displaying a boot message, and performing a power-on self-test (POST).

To find the address of the BIOS, the x86 CPU uses a specific memory address range that is reserved for system-level functions, known as the "real mode" address space. The real mode address space starts at address 0x0000:0x0000 and extends up to 0xFFFF:0xFFFF.

The BIOS is typically stored in a read-only memory (ROM) chip on the motherboard and is mapped to the address range 0xF000:0xFFF0. To access the BIOS, the CPU can simply jump to this address range and start executing the BIOS code.

In protected mode or long mode, the address space is much larger, and the BIOS is typically not directly accessible by the CPU. In these modes, the BIOS is accessed through software interrupt calls (INT), and the actual address of the BIOS code is stored in system tables such as the Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT) or the Global Descriptor Table (GDT).
