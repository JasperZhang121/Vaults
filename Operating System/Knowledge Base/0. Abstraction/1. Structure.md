An operating system (OS) is a collection of software that manages computer hardware resources and provides common services for computer programs. The structure of an operating system can be divided into several layers, which are:

1.  User Interface: This layer provides the interface between the user and the operating system. It could be a graphical user interface (GUI) or a command line interface (CLI).
    
2.  System Calls: This layer provides an interface for programs to access the services and resources of the operating system.
    
3.  System Programs: This layer includes utilities and applications that are used by the system administrator or the end-user to manage the operating system and the computer.
    
4.  Kernel: This is the core of the operating system, and it is responsible for managing hardware resources such as the CPU, memory, and I/O devices. It also implements process and memory management, interrupt handling, and system calls.
    
5.  Hardware Abstraction Layer: This layer provides an abstract view of the underlying hardware to the kernel, hiding the details of the hardware and allowing the kernel to interact with different hardware platforms in a consistent way.  

Each layer of the operating system structure builds upon the layer below it, with the user interface relying on the system calls, the system calls relying on the system programs, and so on, down to the hardware abstraction layer, which relies on the underlying hardware.
