Primitive refers to basic or essential operations in computer science, specifically in the context of operating systems and concurrent programming. Primitives are the building blocks for constructing more complex and sophisticated algorithms and data structures. In the context of concurrent programming, primitives are used to provide synchronization and communication mechanisms for multiple processes or threads.

Examples of primitive operations include:

-   Semaphore: a data structure used to manage access to shared resources and to coordinate communication between multiple processes or threads.
-   Mutex (short for Mutual Exclusion): a synchronization mechanism used to ensure that only one thread can access a shared resource at any given time.
-   Monitors: a high-level synchronization mechanism that provides a convenient way to coordinate communication between multiple processes or threads.

In most cases, these primitives are implemented in the operating system or in a library, and are available to programmers through APIs or libraries.

It's important to note that using these primitives correctly requires a good understanding of concurrent programming and synchronization. Misusing primitives can lead to problems such as race conditions, deadlocks, and starvation.

## Example:

This is a C program that demonstrates the usage of semaphore as a primitive for process mutual exclusion.

```C
#include <pthread.h>
#include <semaphore.h>

sem_t semaphore;

void *thread_function(void *arg)
{
    sem_wait(&semaphore);
    /* critical section */
    sem_post(&semaphore);
}

int main(void)
{
    sem_init(&semaphore, 0, 1);
    pthread_t thread;
    pthread_create(&thread, NULL, &thread_function, NULL);
    /* wait for thread to finish */
    pthread_join(thread, NULL);
    sem_destroy(&semaphore);
    return 0;
}
```
