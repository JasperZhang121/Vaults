Scheduling is a crucial component of any Operating System, responsible for dividing the CPU time among multiple processes or threads. The primary objective of scheduling is to provide an efficient and fair utilization of the system's resources such as CPU time, memory, and I/O devices.

## Why is Scheduling Necessary?

1.  Resource Sharing: Scheduling ensures that the available resources are shared among multiple processes or threads, providing each process or thread with a fair share of the system's resources.
    
2.  CPU Utilization: Scheduling helps maximize the utilization of the CPU by picking the next task to execute, ensuring that the CPU is not idle and is utilized to the fullest.
    
3.  Process Management: Scheduling provides a mechanism for creating, deleting, and executing processes, helping the Operating System control the execution of processes and prevent any process from monopolizing the system's resources.
    
4.  Multitasking: Scheduling enables multitasking, allowing multiple processes or threads to run simultaneously on the system, improving the overall efficiency and performance of the system.
    
5.  Response Time: Scheduling helps reduce the response time of the system by dividing the CPU time among multiple processes or threads, ensuring that the system is able to respond to user requests in a timely manner.
