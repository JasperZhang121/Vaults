A software-based threading mechanism, meaning they are implemented entirely in user-space (that is, in application code), rather than in the operating system or kernel.

## Advantages of User Level Threads

1.  Lightweight: User-level threads are much lighter weight than kernel-level threads because they don't require any system calls, which can be expensive in terms of performance.
2.  Portability: Since user-level threads are implemented in user-space, they are much more portable than kernel-level threads, which are dependent on the underlying operating system.
3.  Ease of Use: User-level threads are much easier to use than kernel-level threads, as they can be created and managed within the same process without requiring any system calls.

## Disadvantages of User Level Threads

1.  Dependence on single threaded process: Since user-level threads are implemented within a single process, if that process becomes blocked or encounters a problem, all threads within that process are also blocked.
2.  Limited by process resources: User-level threads are limited by the resources available to the process within which they run. This can lead to performance problems if the process requires a large amount of memory or CPU time.
3.  No kernel-level support: Since user-level threads are not supported by the kernel, they do not benefit from features such as preemptive scheduling and context switching, which are provided by the kernel in the case of kernel-level threads.

## Comparison with Kernel-Level Threads

In contrast to user-level threads, kernel-level threads are supported directly by the operating system and are implemented in the kernel. This provides several advantages, such as more efficient scheduling, better system-level integration, and the ability to run even if the user-space process is blocked. However, kernel-level threads are also more complex and less portable than user-level threads.
