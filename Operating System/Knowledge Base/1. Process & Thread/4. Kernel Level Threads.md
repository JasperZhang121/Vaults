Kernel level threads are created and managed by the operating system (kernel), in contrast to user-level threads, which are managed by the application or user space.

These threads are typically created and scheduled by the operating system's scheduler and have the same privileges and access to system resources as any other process. They are implemented at the lowest level of the operating system and have a direct impact on system performance.

Kernel level threads are usually used in high-performance systems where the operating system needs to manage multiple tasks simultaneously and require fine-grained control over scheduling and resource allocation.

### Advantages of kernel-level threads:

1.  Better performance: Kernel-level threads are usually faster than user-level threads because they can access the underlying operating system's resources directly.
    
2.  System support: Kernel-level threads have built-in support from the operating system, making it easier to manage and schedule them.
    
3.  Better system integration: Kernel-level threads can take advantage of the operating system's existing facilities, such as process management, inter-process communication, and I/O.    

### Disadvantages of kernel-level threads:

1.  Complexity: Implementing kernel-level threads requires a deep understanding of the operating system, which can make the process more complex.
    
2.  Portability: Kernel-level threads are not portable across different operating systems, which makes it difficult to write software that can run on multiple platforms.
    
3.  Overhead: Kernel-level threads can consume more system resources, such as memory, because they are part of the operating system.
    
4.  Resource contention: Kernel-level threads can compete for the same system resources, which can lead to increased overhead and reduced performance.
