Deadlock is a situation in the operating system where two or more processes are blocked and unable to proceed, because each is waiting for the other to complete. In such a situation, the processes are said to be deadlocked. This can occur in multi-threaded environments, where one thread holds a lock on a resource while waiting for another resource that is being held by another thread.

Deadlocks can be classified into two types:

-   **Resource deadlocks**, where processes hold resources that they need, but are unable to obtain additional resources that they need to complete, because those resources are being held by other processes.
-   **Circular Wait deadlocks**, where processes are waiting for a resource that is being held by another process, which in turn is waiting for a resource that is being held by the original process.

Deadlocks can lead to a complete halt of the system, as no progress can be made. To avoid deadlocks, a number of techniques are used such as:

-   **Lock ordering**, where locks are acquired in a consistent order to prevent circular waits from occurring.
-   **Timeouts**, where processes are forced to release locks after a specified period of time.
-   **Detection and recovery**, where deadlocks are detected and one of the deadlocked processes is terminated, to allow other processes to continue.

Deadlocks can be difficult to diagnose and resolve, so it is important to use techniques such as lock ordering, timeouts, and deadlock detection and recovery, to prevent deadlocks from occurring in the first place.
