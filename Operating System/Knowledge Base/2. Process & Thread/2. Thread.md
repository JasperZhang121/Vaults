A thread is a separate flow of execution within a process. It shares the same memory space and system resources as the parent process, but has its own program counter, stack, and set of register values. This enables multiple threads within a process to run concurrently, which can improve the performance and responsiveness of the system.

Each thread has its own execution path and can run independently of the others, but it can also communicate and synchronize with other threads within the same process. This allows for effective multitasking, where multiple tasks can be executed in parallel, improving the overall performance of the system.

Threads are commonly used in applications that need to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, such as server applications that need to handle multiple client connections, graphical user interfaces that need to respond to user events, and other applications that need to perform background tasks while maintaining a responsive user interface.
