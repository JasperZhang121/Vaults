<span style="color:yellow">Process:</span>
The definition:  a running program

<span style="color:yellow">Illusion:</span>
- by virtualizing the CPU
- running one process, then stopping it and running another, and so forth
- This basic technique, known as time sharing of the CPU, allows users to run as many concurrent processes as they would like
- the potential cost is performance, as each will run more slowly if the CPU(s) must be shared

<span style="color:yellow">Process API:</span>
- Create: must include some method to create new processes
- Destroy: As there is an interface for process creation, systems also provide an interface to destroy processes forcefully
- Wait: wait for a process to stop running
- Miscellaneous Control: other controls that are possible
- Status: get some status information

<span style="color:yellow">Process states:</span>
- Running: In the running state, a process is running on a processor. This means it is executing instructions
- Ready: In the ready state, a process is ready to run but for some reason the OS has chosen not to run it at this given moment.
- Blocked: In the blocked state, a process has performed some kind of operation that makes it not ready to run until some other event takes place.

<span style="color:yellow">Data Structures:</span>
To track the state of each process, for example, the OS likely will keep some kind of process list for all processes that are ready, as well as some additional information to track which process is currently running.

-----

fork(): The fork() system call is used to create a new process.

The process calls the fork() system call, which the OS provides as a way to create a new process. The odd part: the process that is created is an (almost) exact copy of the calling process. That means that to the OS, it now looks like there are two copies of the program running, and both are about to return from the fork() system call. The newly-created process (called the child, in contrast to the creating parent) doesnâ€™t start running at main(), rather, it just comes into life as if it had called fork() itself.

wait(): parent to wait for a child process to finish what it has been doing

exec(): run a program that is different from the calling program

<span style="color:yellow">Process Control Block:</span>
When a process is created, a Process Control Block (PCB) is created and associated with the process. The PCB contains information about the process, including:

-   Process ID: A unique identifier for the process.
    
-   Processor state information: This includes the contents of registers and memory used by the process.
    
-   Processor scheduling information: This includes information used by the operating system's scheduler to determine when the process should be executed and for how long.
    
-   Memory management information: This includes information about the process's memory usage, such as the base and limit of the process's memory allocation and the location of any memory-mapped files.
    
-   I/O status information: This includes information about the process's open files, pipes, and sockets.
    
-   Accounting information: This includes information about the resources used by the process, such as CPU time and memory usage.
    
-   A pointer to the process's parent process: This information is used to support process hierarchy and parent-child relationships.


<p style="color:yellow;">State of PCB:</p>
*The state of a process in a process control block (PCB) describes the current status of the process. The possible states of a process are*:

1.  Running: The process is currently executing instructions.
    
2.  Waiting/Blocked: The process is waiting for some event or resource, such as I/O completion or synchronization with another process.
    
3.  Ready: The process is waiting to be assigned to a CPU.
    
4.  Terminated: The process has completed execution or been terminated by the operating system.

## <span style="color:yellow">Components of a Process in a Computer System:</span>

A process in a computer system consists of the following components:

-   **Process Control Block (PCB)**: This is a data structure that contains information about the process such as its status, priority, program counter, CPU registers, and other details. The operating system uses this information to manage the process and allocate resources.
    
-   **Data Segment**: This is the portion of memory where the process stores its variables and dynamic data structures.
    
-   **Program Segment**: This is the portion of memory where the process stores its instructions and code.
    

Together, the PCB, data segment, and program segment make up a process and allow the operating system to manage and allocate resources to it.

## <span style="color:yellow">How a Process Runs on the CPU:</span>

A process is a program in execution and is one of the basic units of computing. A process is made up of several components, including a program, data, and system resources such as CPU time and memory. In order for a process to run on the CPU, it must go through several stages.

### 1. Program Loading

The first stage of the process is to load the program into memory. This is done by the operating system, which reads the executable file from disk into memory.

### 2. Processor Scheduling

Once the program is loaded into memory, the CPU must be allocated to the process. This is done by the CPU scheduler, which determines which process should be executed next based on various scheduling algorithms.

### 3. Context Switching

When the CPU is allocated to the process, the operating system must perform a context switch. This involves saving the state of the current process and loading the state of the new process. The state of a process includes the contents of registers, the contents of memory, and the current instruction pointer.

### 4. Execution

Once the context switch is complete, the CPU begins executing the process. The CPU fetches instructions from memory and executes them one by one. Each instruction is executed in a single CPU cycle, and the CPU continues executing instructions until the process terminates or is preempted.

### 5. Preemption

Preemption is the act of interrupting a process that is currently running on the CPU. This can occur for several reasons, such as an interrupt from a hardware device, a time slice expiration, or a higher priority process becoming available. When a process is preempted, the operating system performs a context switch, saving the state of the current process and loading the state of the new process.

### 6. Termination

The process terminates when it reaches the end of the program or when it encounters a termination instruction. Once the process terminates, the operating system deallocates any resources that were allocated to the process, such as CPU time and memory, and the process is removed from the list of active processes.

### Process Communication:

refers to the method by which different processes exchange data and coordinate their actions. There are several techniques for process communication in an operating system, including:

1.  Pipes: Pipes are a type of inter-process communication that allow data to be passed between two or more processes. Pipes can be unidirectional or bidirectional, and the data passed between processes is usually buffered in the kernel.
    
2.  Message Passing: Message passing is another type of process communication that allows processes to exchange data by sending and receiving messages. The operating system provides message-passing primitives for the processes to use.
    
3.  Shared Memory: Shared memory is a method of inter-process communication in which two or more processes can access a shared region of memory in order to exchange data. This is a fast and efficient method of communication, but requires careful synchronization to prevent data races.
    
4.  Signals: Signals are a type of asynchronous communication mechanism used in an operating system. A signal is sent from one process to another process to indicate a specific event or request.
    
5.  Sockets: Sockets are a type of inter-process communication that allow processes to communicate over a network. Sockets can be used for both local and remote communication, and are commonly used for network programming and inter-process communication in distributed systems.
