<span style="color:yellow">The Address Space:</span>
The address space of a process contains all of the memory state of the running program. For example, the code of the program (the instructions) have to live in memory somewhere, and thus they are in the address space.

The program, while it is running, uses a stack to keep track of where it is in the function call chain as well as to allocate local variables and pass parameters and return values to and from routines. Finally, the heap is used for dynamically-allocated, user-managed memory, such as that you might receive from a call to malloc() in C or new in an objectoriented language such as C++ or Java.

However, this placement of stack and heap is just a convention; you could arrange the address space in a different way if youâ€™d like.

When the OS does this, we say the OS is virtualizing memory, because the running program thinks it is loaded into memory at a particular address (say 0) and has a potentially very large address space (say 32-bits or 64-bits); the reality is quite different.
