1. Instruction Queue: The instruction queue holds the upcoming instructions fetched from memory. It helps in pipelining and instruction prefetching.
    
2. Instruction Decoder: The instruction decoder decodes the fetched instructions and generates control signals to coordinate the operation of other units.
    
3. General Purpose Registers: The 8086 has eight general-purpose registers (AX, BX, CX, DX, SI, DI, BP, and SP) that can be used for storing data during program execution.
    
4. Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU): The ALU performs arithmetic and logical operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, bitwise operations, and comparisons.
    
5. Control Unit: The control unit controls the flow of instructions and data within the microprocessor. It generates control signals to coordinate the operation of other units based on the decoded instructions.
    
6. Segment Registers: The 8086 uses segment registers (CS, DS, SS, and ES) to provide memory addressing capabilities. They are used in conjunction with the offset to calculate the physical address of memory locations.
    
7. Address Generation Unit (AGU): The AGU generates effective addresses by combining the contents of segment registers and offsets. It calculates the actual memory address for fetching or storing data.
    
8. Bus Interface Unit (BIU): The BIU manages the interaction of the microprocessor with the external memory and I/O devices. It controls the address and data buses for fetching instructions and data.
    
9. Execution Unit (EU): The EU is responsible for executing instructions. It includes the ALU, control logic, and other components required for instruction execution.
