### Master Boot Record (MBR):
- Located in the first sector (sector 0) of a bootable storage device.
- Contains initial boot code, partition table, and boot signature.
- Primary functions:
	- Bootstrapping: Initiates the boot process by loading and executing the bootloader.
	- Partition table: Describes the partition layout of the storage device.
	- Boot signature: Last two bytes (0xAA55) indicate a valid boot sector.

### Bootloader:
- Responsible for loading and executing the operating system or other software.
- Loaded by the MBR and resides in a separate partition or within the same partition.
- Tasks performed by the bootloader:
	- Disk initialization: Sets up hardware configurations and initializes the disk controller.
	- Loading the operating system: Reads necessary files or sectors from the storage device into memory.
	- Transferring control: Transfers control to the loaded program for further execution.
- Can be specific to the operating system or system architecture.
- Manages system configurations, loads additional components, and transitions the system to an operational state.

### Benefits of MBR and Bootloader:
- Bootstrapping: MBR initiates the boot process, ensuring a well-defined starting point.
- Partitioning: MBR's partition table allows for multiple partitions and different operating systems.
- Compatibility: Traditional design maintains compatibility with legacy systems and software.
- Flexibility: Bootloader can be customized for various boot configurations.
- Protection: MBR protects the bootloader and operating system from accidental modifications.

### Importance of MBR and Bootloader:
- Essential components of the boot process.
- Enable the system to start up and load the operating system.
- Facilitate partition management and booting from multiple operating systems.
- Provide compatibility with legacy systems and allow for customization.
