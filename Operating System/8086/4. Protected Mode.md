Protected Mode is an operating mode available in x86 processors that provides advanced memory management and protection features. It allows the operating system to create a secure and isolated environment for running multiple applications concurrently. Here are some key points about Protected Mode:

1. Memory Segmentation:
    
    - Protected Mode introduces a more advanced memory segmentation mechanism compared to Real Mode. It allows the system to divide memory into segments of variable sizes, providing flexibility in memory organization and access control.
    - Each segment has its own base address and limit, which define the range of memory it can access.
    - Segmentation allows for memory protection by assigning different privilege levels (rings) to segments, controlling their access rights.
2. Virtual Memory:
    
    - Protected Mode enables virtual memory support, allowing each process to have its own virtual address space.
    - Virtual memory allows for efficient memory allocation, protection, and sharing among processes.
    - The operating system manages the mapping between virtual addresses and physical addresses using page tables.
3. Multitasking and Privilege Levels:
    
    - Protected Mode supports multitasking, allowing multiple tasks or processes to run simultaneously.
    - Privilege Levels (Rings) provide different levels of access and control over system resources.
    - Ring 0 (Kernel Mode) is the highest privilege level, providing full access to the system's resources.
    - Rings 1-2 (Driver/Kernel Extensions) are used by trusted components of the operating system.
    - Ring 3 (User Mode) is the least privileged level, used by user applications.
4. Memory Protection:
    
    - Protected Mode enforces memory protection, preventing processes from accessing memory areas owned by other processes.
    - Segmentation and Paging mechanisms help isolate processes and protect against unauthorized access or modification of memory.
5. Enhanced Instruction Set:
    
    - Protected Mode provides access to a larger instruction set, including additional addressing modes and instructions not available in Real Mode.
    - These enhancements improve the performance and capabilities of the system.
6. Interrupts and Exception Handling:
    
    - Protected Mode introduces a more advanced interrupt and exception handling mechanism, allowing for better error handling and system stability.
    - The operating system can define handlers for various events and exceptions, enabling proper error recovery and system control.
