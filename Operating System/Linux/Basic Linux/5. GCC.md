```

```shell
./test
```

Debug:

```shell
g++ -g test.cpp -o test
```

In debug mode:

- Run
```shell
run
```

- add break
```shell
# break at line 13
break 13
```

```shell
# break at line 14
b 14
```

- check break
```shell
info breakpoints
```

- print variables
```shell
# i is a variable in the cpp file
print i
```

```shell
p i
```

- continue to next break:
```shell
continue
```

- show surrounding codes

list
```

- display:

# sum is a variable we wanna fpcus
display sum
```

Optimization: 
- -o
- -oe
- -o1
- -o2
- -o3

```shell
g++ -o2 test.cpp -o test
```

Print warn:
```shell
g++ -Wall test.cpp
```

Set compile standards:

```shell
g++ -std=c++11 test.cpp
```

Search head files:
```shell
## myinclude is the directory for the head file
g++ -Imyinclude test.cpp
```

Tree  demo 
```
|-include
|    |-swap.h
