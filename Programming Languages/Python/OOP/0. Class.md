### Example:

```python
class Car:
    def __init__(self, make, model, year):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model
        self.year = year

    def start_engine(self):
        print("Engine started.")

    def stop_engine(self):
        print("Engine stopped.")
```

In this example, we have defined a `Car` class with a constructor method (`__init__`) that takes in three parameters (`make`, `model`, `year`) and initializes the corresponding attributes. We have also defined two methods (`start_engine` and `stop_engine`) that represent behaviors of the `Car` object.

To create an instance of this class, we can do:
```python
my_car = Car("Toyota", "Camry", 2021)
```

Now, `my_car` is an object of the `Car` class, with its own set of attributes and behaviors. We can call the methods of the object like this:
```python
my_car.start_engine() # Output: Engine started.
my_car.stop_engine() # Output: Engine stopped.
```
