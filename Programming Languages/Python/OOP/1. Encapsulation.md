```python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, account_number, balance):
        self.__account_number = account_number
        self.__balance = balance

    def get_balance(self):
        return self.__balance

    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.__balance += amount

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if self.__balance >= amount:
            self.__balance -= amount
        else:
            print("Insufficient funds")

account = BankAccount("123456789", 1000)
print(account.get_balance()) # output: 1000
account.deposit(500)
print(account.get_balance()) # output: 1500
account.__balance = 2000 # trying to change balance directly
print(account.get_balance()) # output: 1500 (balance remains unchanged)
```

In this example, the `BankAccount` class has two private attributes, `__account_number` and `__balance`. These attributes can only be accessed through the class methods `get_balance`, `deposit`, and `withdraw`, which encapsulate the internal workings of the class. The `__balance` attribute cannot be accessed or modified directly from outside the class, as demonstrated by the failed attempt to change it directly in the last line of code.
