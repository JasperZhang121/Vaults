When we have a reference to an object, how can we know its type and the methods it has?

**Using type()**

First, we can determine the object type by using the `type()` function:

You can use `type()` to judge basic types:

```python
>>> type(123)
<class 'int'>
>>> type('str')
<class 'str'>
>>> type(None)
<type(None) 'NoneType'>
```

If a variable points to a function or a class, you can also use `type()` to judge:

```python
>>> type(abs)
<class 'builtin_function_or_method'>
>>> type(a)
<class '__main__.Animal'>
```

But what type does the `type()` function return? It returns the corresponding Class type. If we want to use it in an if statement, we need to compare two variables' type types to see if they are the same:

```python
>>> type(123)==type(456)
True
>>> type(123)==int
True
>>> type('abc')==type('123')
True
>>> type('abc')==str
True
>>> type('abc')==type(123)
False
```

To judge if an object is a function, you can use constants defined in the `types` module:

```python
>>> import types
>>> def fn():
...     pass
...
>>> type(fn)==types.FunctionType
True
>>> type(abs)==types.BuiltinFunctionType
True
>>> type(lambda x: x)==types.LambdaType
True
>>> type((x for x in range(10)))==types.GeneratorType
True
```

**Using isinstance()**

For class inheritance relationships, using `type()` is inconvenient. We can use the `isinstance()` function to judge a class's type.

Let's go back to the previous example. If the inheritance relationship is:

object -> Animal -> Dog -> Husky

Then, `isinstance()` can tell us whether an object is a certain type. First, let's create three types of objects:

```python
>>> a = Animal()
>>> d = Dog()
>>> h = Husky()
```

Then judge:

```python
>>> isinstance(h, Husky)
True
```

No problem, because the `h` variable points to a Husky object.

And then judge:

```python
>>> isinstance(h, Dog)
True
```

Although `h` itself is of type Husky, since Husky is inherited from Dog, `h` is also considered a Dog type. In other words, `isinstance()` determines whether an object is that type itself, or lies on that type's parent inheritance chain.

Therefore, we can be sure that `h` is also an Animal type:

```python
>>> isinstance(h, Animal)
True
```

Similarly, the actual type is Dog's `d` is also an Animal type:

```python
>>> isinstance(d, Dog) and isinstance(d, Animal)
True
```

But `d` is not a Husky type:

```python
>>> isinstance(d, Husky)
False
```

Types that can be judged by `type()` can also be judged with `isinstance()`:

```python
>>> isinstance('a', str)
True
>>> isinstance(123, int)
True
>>> isinstance(b'a', bytes)
True
```

And you can even judge if a variable is one of some types, like the following code can judge if it is a list or a tuple:

```python
>>> isinstance([1, 2, 3], (list, tuple))
True
>>> isinstance((1, 2, 3), (list, tuple))
True
```

Always prefer to use `isinstance()` to judge types, it can cover a specified type and its subclasses in one go.

**Using dir()**

If you want to get all attributes and methods of an object, you can use the `dir()` function. It returns a list containing strings, for example, to get all attributes and methods of a str object:

```python
>>> dir('ABC')
['__add__', '__class__',..., '__subclasshook__', 'capitalize', 'casefold',..., 'zfill']
```

Attributes and methods like `__xxx__` in Python have special uses, for example, the `__len__` method returns the length. In Python, if you call the `len()` function trying to get an object's length, it actually internally calls the object's `__len__()` method. So, the following code is equivalent:

```python
>>> len('ABC')
3
>>> 'ABC'.__len__()
3
```

For our custom classes, if we also want to use `len(myObj)`, then we just write our `__len__()` method:

```python
>>> class MyDog(object):
...     def __len

__(self):
...         return 100
...
>>> dog = MyDog()
>>> len(dog)
100
```

The rest are common properties or methods, such as `lower()` returning the lowercase string:

```python
>>> 'ABC'.lower()
'abc'
```

Simply listing the properties and methods is not enough. Combined with `getattr()`, `setattr()`, and `hasattr()`, we can directly manipulate an object's state:

```python
>>> class MyObject(object):
...     def __init__(self):
...         self.x = 9
...     def power(self):
...         return self.x * self.x
...
>>> obj = MyObject()
```

Then, you can test the object's properties:

```python
>>> hasattr(obj, 'x') # Does it have the property 'x'?
True
>>> obj.x
9
>>> hasattr(obj, 'y') # Does it have the property 'y'?
False
>>> setattr(obj, 'y', 19) # Set a property 'y'
>>> hasattr(obj, 'y') # Does it have the property 'y' now?
True
>>> getattr(obj, 'y') # Get the property 'y'
19
>>> obj.y # Get the property 'y'
19
```

Trying to get a non-existing property will throw an AttributeError:

```python
>>> getattr(obj, 'z') # Get the property 'z'
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
AttributeError: 'MyObject' object has no attribute 'z'
```

You can pass a default parameter, if the property doesn't exist, it returns a default value:

```python
>>> getattr(obj, 'z', 404) # Get the property 'z', if it doesn't exist, return default value 404
404
```

You can also get an object's method:

```python
>>> hasattr(obj, 'power') # Does it have the property 'power'?
True
>>> getattr(obj, 'power') # Get the property 'power'
<bound method MyObject.power of <__main__.MyObject object at 0x10077a6a0>>
>>> fn = getattr(obj, 'power') # Get the property 'power' and assign it to variable fn
>>> fn # fn points to obj.power
<bound method MyObject.power of <__main__.MyObject object at 0x10077a6a0>>
>>> fn() # Calling fn() is the same as calling obj.power()
81
```
