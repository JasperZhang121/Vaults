Inheritance is a crucial aspect of object-oriented programming because it allows a subclass to extend the functionality of a superclass.

Recall the design of the Animal class hierarchy. Suppose we want to implement the following four types of animals:

- Dog
- Bat
- Parrot
- Ostrich

If we classify by mammals and birds, we could design the class hierarchy like this:

```
                ┌───────────────┐
                │    Animal     │
                └───────────────┘
                        │
           ┌────────────┴────────────┐
           │                         │
           ▼                         ▼
    ┌─────────────┐           ┌─────────────┐
    │   Mammal    │           │    Bird     │
    └─────────────┘           └─────────────┘
           │                         │
     ┌─────┴──────┐            ┌─────┴──────┐
     │            │            │            │
     ▼            ▼            ▼            ▼
┌─────────┐  ┌─────────┐  ┌─────────┐  ┌─────────┐
│   Dog   │  │   Bat   │  │ Parrot  │  │ Ostrich │
└─────────┘  └─────────┘  └─────────┘  └─────────┘
```

But if we classify by "can run" and "can fly", we should design the class hierarchy like this:

```
                ┌───────────────┐
                │    Animal     │
                └───────────────┘
                        │
           ┌────────────┴────────────┐
           │                         │
           ▼                         ▼
    ┌─────────────┐           ┌─────────────┐
    │  Runnable   │           │   Flyable   │
    └─────────────┘           └─────────────┘
           │                         │
     ┌─────┴──────┐            ┌─────┴──────┐
     │            │            │            │
     ▼            ▼            ▼            ▼
┌─────────┐  ┌─────────┐  ┌─────────┐  ┌─────────┐
│   Dog   │  │ Ostrich │  │ Parrot  │  │   Bat   │
└─────────┘  └─────────┘  └─────────┘  └─────────┘
```

To include both classifications, we would have to design even more class levels, which would lead to an exponential increase in the number of classes. This is obviously not feasible.

The correct approach is to use multiple inheritance. Initially, we keep the main class hierarchy as mammals and birds:

```python
class Animal(object):
    pass

# Main categories:
class Mammal(Animal):
    pass

class Bird(Animal):
    pass

# Specific animals:
class Dog(Mammal):
    pass

class Bat(Mammal):
    pass

class Parrot(Bird):
    pass

class Ostrich(Bird):
    pass
```

Now, to add Runnable and Flyable functionalities, we just need to define Runnable and Flyable classes:

```python
class Runnable(object):
    def run(self):
        print('Running...')

class Flyable(object):
    def fly(self):
        print('Flying...')
```

For animals that need the Runnable functionality, like Dog, we inherit from Runnable as well:

```python
class Dog(Mammal, Runnable):
    pass
```

For those needing Flyable, like Bat, we inherit from Flyable:

```python
class Bat(Mammal, Flyable):
    pass
```

Through multiple inheritance, a subclass can acquire the functionalities of multiple parent classes.

**MixIn**

In class hierarchy design, usually, the main line is single inheritance. For example, Ostrich inherits from Bird. However, to "mix in" additional functionalities, multiple inheritance can be used, such as letting Ostrich inherit from both Bird and Runnable. This design is often referred to as MixIn.

To better show inheritance relationships, we might rename Runnable and Flyable to RunnableMixIn and FlyableMixIn. Similarly, you could define CarnivorousMixIn and HerbivoresMixIn, allowing an animal to have several MixIn functionalities:

```python
class Dog(Mammal, RunnableMixIn, CarnivorousMixIn):
    pass
```

The goal of MixIn is to add multiple functionalities to

 a class. This approach encourages us to compose functionalities through multiple inheritance rather than designing a complex hierarchy.

Python's standard library also uses MixIn extensively. For instance, Python includes TCPServer and UDPServer classes, while ForkingMixIn and ThreadingMixIn provide multi-process or multi-thread models. By combining them, we can create suitable services:

```python
class MyTCPServer(TCPServer, ForkingMixIn):
    pass

class MyUDPServer(UDPServer, ThreadingMixIn):
    pass
```

If aiming for a more advanced coroutine model, you could write a CoroutineMixIn:

```python
class MyTCPServer(TCPServer, CoroutineMixIn):
    pass
```

This way, we avoid complex inheritance chains by selecting different class functionalities to quickly construct the desired subclass.
