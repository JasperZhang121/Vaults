Data encapsulation is a key aspect of object-oriented programming. In the Student class above, each instance possesses its data, such as `name` and `score`. These data can be accessed through functions, for example, to print a student's score:

```python
>>> def print_score(std):
...     print('%s: %s' % (std.name, std.score))
...
>>> print_score(bart)
Bart Simpson: 59
```

However, since Student instances already own these data, accessing them from an external function is unnecessary; they can be directly defined within the Student class, thus "encapsulating" the data. These functions associated with the Student class are called class methods:

```python
class Student(object):

    def __init__(self, name, score):
        self.name = name
        self.score = score

    def print_score(self):
        print('%s: %s' % (self.name, self.score))
```

To call a method, simply invoke it directly on the instance variable. Aside from not needing to pass `self`, other parameters are passed normally:

```python
>>> bart.print_score()
Bart Simpson: 59
```

Through encapsulation, the internal definition of how to print is hidden within the Student class, simplifying calls while hiding the implementation details.

Another advantage of encapsulation is the ability to add new methods to the Student class, like `get_grade`:

```python
class Student(object):
    ...

    def get_grade(self):
        if self.score >= 90:
            return 'A'
        elif self.score >= 60:
            return 'B'
        else:
            return 'C'
```

Just like `get_grade`, methods can be directly called on the instance variable without knowing the internal implementation details:

```python
lisa = Student('Lisa', 99)
bart = Student('Bart', 59)
print(lisa.name, lisa.get_grade())
print(bart.name, bart.get_grade())
```
