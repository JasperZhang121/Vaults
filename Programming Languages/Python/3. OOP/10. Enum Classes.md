When we need to define constants, one method is to use uppercase variables defined by integers, such as for months:

```python
JAN = 1
FEB = 2
MAR = 3
...
NOV = 11
DEC = 12
```

The advantage is simplicity, but the downside is that the type is `int`, and they are still variables.

A better method is to define a class for such enumeration types, where each constant is a unique instance of the class. Python provides the `Enum` class for this purpose:

```python
from enum import Enum

Month = Enum('Month', ('Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May', 'Jun', 'Jul', 'Aug', 'Sep', 'Oct', 'Nov', 'Dec'))
```

This way, we get an enumeration class of type `Month`, which allows us to directly use `Month.Jan` to reference a constant, or enumerate all its members:

```python
for name, member in Month.__members__.items():
    print(name, '=>', member, ',', member.value)
```

The `value` attribute is an automatically assigned `int` constant, starting from 1 by default.

For more precise control over enumeration types, you can derive a custom class from `Enum`:

```python
from enum import Enum, unique

@unique
class Weekday(Enum):
    Sun = 0  # Sun's value is set to 0
    Mon = 1
    Tue = 2
    Wed = 3
    Thu = 4
    Fri = 5
    Sat = 6
```

The `@unique` decorator can help ensure there are no duplicate values.

There are several ways to access these enumeration types:

```python
day1 = Weekday.Mon
print(day1)  # Weekday.Mon
print(Weekday.Tue)  # Weekday.Tue
print(Weekday['Tue'])  # Weekday.Tue
print(Weekday.Tue.value)  # 2
print(day1 == Weekday.Mon)  # True
print(day1 == Weekday.Tue)  # False
print(Weekday(1))  # Weekday.Mon
print(day1 == Weekday(1))  # True
Weekday(7)
# Raises ValueError: 7 is not a valid Weekday
```

```python
for name, member in Weekday.__members__.items():
    print(name, '=>', member)
```

You can see that you can reference enumeration constants by member name or directly by the value to obtain the enumeration constant.
