Under normal circumstances, after we've defined a class and created an instance of the class, we can bind any attributes and methods to that instance. This is the flexibility of dynamic languages. First, let's define a class:

```python
class Student(object):
    pass
```

Then, try to bind an attribute to an instance:

```python
>>> s = Student()
>>> s.name = 'Michael'  # Dynamically bind an attribute to the instance
>>> print(s.name)
Michael
```

You can also try to bind a method to an instance:

```python
>>> def set_age(self, age):  # Define a function as an instance method
...     self.age = age
...
>>> from types import MethodType
>>> s.set_age = MethodType(set_age, s)  # Bind a method to the instance
>>> s.set_age(25)  # Call the instance method
>>> s.age  # Test the result
25
```

However, a method bound to one instance does not work for another instance:

```python
>>> s2 = Student()  # Create a new instance
>>> s2.set_age(25)  # Try to call the method
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
AttributeError: 'Student' object has no attribute 'set_age'
```

To bind a method to all instances, you can bind the method to the class:

```python
>>> def set_score(self, score):
...     self.score = score
...
>>> Student.set_score = set_score
```

After binding the method to the class, all instances can call it:

```python
>>> s.set_score(100)
>>> s.score
100
>>> s2.set_score(99)
>>> s2.score
99
```

Usually, the `set_score` method can be directly defined in the class, but dynamic binding allows us to add functionality to the class during runtime, which is difficult to achieve in static languages.

**Using `__slots__`**

But what if we want to limit the attributes of an instance? For example, only allow the `Student` instance to have `name` and `age` attributes.

To achieve this limitation, Python allows us to define a special `__slots__` variable when defining a class to limit the attributes that class instances can add:

```python
class Student(object):
    __slots__ = ('name', 'age')  # Use a tuple to define allowed attribute names
```

Then, let's try:

```python
>>> s = Student()  # Create a new instance
>>> s.name = 'Michael'  # Bind 'name' attribute
>>> s.age = 25  # Bind 'age' attribute
>>> s.score = 99  # Try to bind 'score' attribute
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
AttributeError: 'Student' object has no attribute 'score'
```

Because `score` is not included in `__slots__`, the `score` attribute cannot be bound, trying to bind `score` will result in an `AttributeError`.

It's important to note that `__slots__` defined attributes only affect the current class instance, not the inherited subclasses:

```python
>>> class GraduateStudent(Student):
...     pass
...
>>> g = GraduateStudent()
>>> g.score = 9999
```

Unless `__slots__` is also defined in the subclass, in which case, the attributes allowed to be defined in the subclass instance are its own `__slots__` plus the parent class's `__slots__`.
