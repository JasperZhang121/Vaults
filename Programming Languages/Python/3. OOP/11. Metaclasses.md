**type()**

The biggest difference between dynamic and static languages is that functions and classes are defined at runtime in dynamic languages, not at compile time.

For example, to define a class called `Hello`, we write a module named `hello.py`:

```python
class Hello(object):
    def hello(self, name='world'):
        print('Hello, %s.' % name)
```

When the Python interpreter loads the `hello` module, it executes all the statements in the module sequentially. The execution result is the dynamic creation of a `Hello` class object. Testing it:

```python
>>> from hello import Hello
>>> h = Hello()
>>> h.hello()
Hello, world.
>>> print(type(Hello))
<class 'type'>
>>> print(type(h))
<class 'hello.Hello'>
```

The `type()` function can check a type or a variable's type. `Hello` is a class, and its type is `type`, while `h` is an instance whose type is the class `Hello`.

We say that the definition of a class is dynamically created at runtime, and the method to create a class is using the `type()` function.

`type()` not only returns the type of an object but also creates new types. For example, we can create the `Hello` class without defining it with `class Hello(object)...`:

```python
>>> def fn(self, name='world'):  # define a function first
...     print('Hello, %s.' % name)
...
>>> Hello = type('Hello', (object,), dict(hello=fn))  # create Hello class
>>> h = Hello()
>>> h.hello()
Hello, world.
```

To create a class object, `type()` takes three arguments:

- The name of the class.
- A tuple of the parent class(es), note that Python supports multiple inheritance.
- A dictionary containing attributes and their values, here we bind the `fn` function to the method name `hello`.

Classes created by `type()` and those directly written are completely the same because when Python sees a class definition, it just scans the syntax and then calls `type()` to create the class.

Normally, we use `class Xxx...` to define classes, but `type()` also allows us to dynamically create classes, which is a significant difference from static languages.

**metaclass**

Besides using `type()` to dynamically create classes, you can use metaclasses to control class creation.

`Metaclass`, translated directly as a metaclass, simply put, means:

- After defining a class, you can create instances of the class, so: define the class, then create instances.
- But what if we want to create a class? Then, you need a metaclass to create the class, so: define metaclass, then create the class.
- Connecting them: define metaclass, can create classes, finally create instances.

So, metaclasses allow you to create or modify classes. In other words, you can consider classes as "instances" created by metaclasses.

Metaclasses are one of the most abstract features of Python and the most difficult to use. Normally, you won't encounter the need to use metaclasses, so it's okay if you don't understand the following content, as you likely won't need it.

Let's look at a simple example. This metaclass can add an `add` method to our custom `MyList`:

Define `ListMetaclass`, which should inherit from `type` as metaclasses are templates for classes:

```python
class ListMetaclass(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, attrs):
        attrs['add'] = lambda self, value: self.append(value)
        return type.__new__(cls, name, bases, attrs)
```

With `ListMetaclass`, when defining a class, indicate using `ListMetaclass` to customize the class by passing the keyword argument `metaclass`:

```python
class MyList(list, metaclass=ListMetaclass):
    pass
```

When the `metaclass` keyword argument is passed, the magic happens. It directs the Python interpreter to create `MyList` through `ListMetaclass.__new__()`, allowing modification of the class's definition, such as adding new methods, before returning the modified definition.

`__new__()` receives:

- The object of the class being created.
- The name of the class.
- The tuple of parent classes.
- The dictionary of class methods.

Testing `MyList` for the `add()` method:

```python
>>> L = MyList()
>>> L.add(1)
>>> L
[1]
```

This example demonstrates the capability to dynamically modify classes using metaclasses, a complex but powerful feature of Python's dynamic nature.
