Because Python is a dynamic language, instances created from a class can bind any attributes freely.

The method to bind attributes to an instance is through instance variables or through the `self` variable:

```python
class Student(object):
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

s = Student('Bob')
s.score = 90
```

However, what if the Student class itself needs to bind an attribute? You can directly define an attribute within the class, which is known as a class attribute, belonging to the Student class:

```python
class Student(object):
    name = 'Student'
```

Once we've defined a class attribute, although it belongs to the class, all instances of the class can access it. Let's test it:

```python
>>> class Student(object):
...     name = 'Student'
...
>>> s = Student() # Create instance s
>>> print(s.name) # Print the name attribute, since the instance does not have a name attribute, it will continue to look for the class's name attribute
Student
>>> print(Student.name) # Print the class's name attribute
Student
>>> s.name = 'Michael' # Bind name attribute to instance
>>> print(s.name) # Since instance attribute has a higher priority than class attribute, it will overshadow the class's name attribute
Michael
>>> print(Student.name) # However, the class attribute has not disappeared, Student.name can still access it
Student
>>> del s.name # If the instance's name attribute is deleted
>>> print(s.name) # Calling s.name again, since the instance's name attribute was not found, the class's name attribute is shown
Student
```

From the example above, it's clear that when programming, never use the same name for instance attributes and class attributes, because instance attributes with the same name will overshadow class attributes. However, when you delete the instance attribute, accessing it again with the same name will refer to the class attribute.
