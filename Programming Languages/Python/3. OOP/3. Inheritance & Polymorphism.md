In object-oriented programming design, when we define a class, we can inherit from an existing class. The new class is called a subclass (Subclass), while the inherited class is known as the base class, parent class, or super class (Base class, Super class).

For example, if we have already written a class named `Animal` with a `run()` method that can directly print:

```python
class Animal(object):
    def run(self):
        print('Animal is running...')
```

When we need to write `Dog` and `Cat` classes, we can directly inherit from the `Animal` class:

```python
class Dog(Animal):
    pass

class Cat(Animal):
    pass
```

For `Dog`, `Animal` is its parent class, and for `Animal`, `Dog` is its subclass. `Cat` and `Dog` are similar.

What's the benefit of inheritance? The biggest benefit is that the subclass gets all the functionalities of the parent class. Since `Animal` implemented the `run()` method, as its subclasses, `Dog` and `Cat` automatically own the `run()` method without doing anything:

```python
dog = Dog()
dog.run()

cat = Cat()
cat.run()
```

Output:

```
Animal is running...
Animal is running...
```

Certainly, we can also add some methods to the subclass, like the `Dog` class:

```python
class Dog(Animal):

    def run(self):
        print('Dog is running...')

    def eat(self):
        print('Eating meat...')
```

The second benefit of inheritance needs us to make a slight improvement in our code. As observed, whether for `Dog` or `Cat`, their `run()` method displays `Animal is running...`, but logically, it would be more appropriate to separately display `Dog is running...` and `Cat is running...`. Therefore, we make the following improvements to the `Dog` and `Cat` classes:

```python
class Dog(Animal):

    def run(self):
        print('Dog is running...')

class Cat(Animal):

    def run(self):
        print('Cat is running...')
```

Upon running again, the results are as follows:

```
Dog is running...
Cat is running...
```

When both the child class and the parent class have the same `run()` method, we say the `run()` method of the child class overrides that of the parent class. During code execution, the `run()` method of the child class is always invoked. This gives us another benefit of inheritance: polymorphism.

To understand what polymorphism is, we first need to make a further explanation about data types. When we define a class, we essentially define a new data type. The data type we define is no different from Python's built-in data types such as `str`, `list`, and `dict`:

```python
a = list()  # a is of type list
b = Animal()  # b is of type Animal
c = Dog()  # c is of type Dog
```

To judge whether a variable is of a certain type, we can use `isinstance()`:

```python
>>> isinstance(a, list)
True
>>> isinstance(b, Animal)
True
>>> isinstance(c, Dog)
True
```

It seems `a`, `b`, `c` indeed correspond to `list`, `Animal`, `Dog` types, respectively.

But wait, try this:

```python
>>> isinstance(c, Animal)
True
```

It turns out `c` is not only `Dog`, but also `Animal`!

Upon reflection, this makes sense, because `Dog` is inherited from `Animal`. When we create an instance `c` of `Dog`, we think of `c`'s data type as `Dog`, but `c` is also `Animal`, and `Dog` is inherently a type of `Animal`!

So, in an inheritance relationship, if an instance's data type is a subclass, then its data type can also be seen as the parent class. However, the reverse is not true:

```python
>>> b = Animal()
>>> isinstance(b, Dog)
False
```

`Dog` can be considered as `Animal`, but `Animal` cannot be considered as `Dog`.

To understand the benefits of polymorphism, we need to write a function that accepts an `Animal` type variable:

```python
def run_twice(animal):
    animal.run()
    animal.run()
```

When we pass an instance of `Animal`, `run_twice()` prints:

```
Animal is running...
Animal is running...
```

When we pass an instance of `Dog`, `run_twice()` prints:

```
Dog is running...
Dog is running...
```

When we pass an

 instance of `Cat`, `run_twice()` prints:

```
Cat is running...
Cat is running...
```

It might not seem interesting at first, but think carefully. Now, if we define a `Tortoise` type also derived from `Animal`:

```python
class Tortoise(Animal):
    def run(self):
        print('Tortoise is running slowly...')
```

When we call `run_twice()`, passing an instance of `Tortoise`:

```
Tortoise is running slowly...
Tortoise is running slowly...
```

You'll find that adding a new subclass of `Animal` requires no modification to `run_twice()` at all. In fact, any function or method that depends on `Animal` type can run without modifications, which is the magic of polymorphism.

The benefit of polymorphism is that when we need to pass in `Dog`, `Cat`, `Tortoise`, etc., we only need to receive an `Animal` type, because `Dog`, `Cat`, `Tortoise`, etc., are all types of `Animal`. Then, operating as an `Animal` type will do. Since the `Animal` type has a `run()` method, the actual type's `run()` method will be automatically invoked. This is the true power of polymorphism: the caller only cares about the calling, not the details, and when we add a new type of `Animal` subclass, as long as the `run()` method is written correctly, there's no need to worry about how the original code was called. This embodies the famous "Open-Closed" principle:

- Open for extension: allowing the addition of new `Animal` subclasses;
- Closed for modification: no need to modify dependent functions such as `run_twice()` that use `Animal` type.

Inheritance can also be inherited level by level, just like the relationship from grandfather to father, and then to son. Any class can ultimately trace back to the root class `object`. These inheritance relationships look like an inverted tree. For example, the following inheritance tree:

```
                ┌───────────────┐
                │    object     │
                └───────────────┘
                        │
           ┌────────────┴────────────┐
           │                         │
           ▼                         ▼
    ┌─────────────┐           ┌─────────────┐
    │   Animal    │           │    Plant    │
    └─────────────┘           └─────────────┘
           │                         │
     ┌─────┴──────┐            ┌─────┴──────┐
     │            │            │            │
     ▼            ▼            ▼            ▼
┌─────────┐  ┌─────────┐  ┌─────────┐  ┌─────────┐
│   Dog   │  │   Cat   │  │  Tree   │  │ Flower  │
└─────────┘  └─────────┘  └─────────┘  └─────────┘
```

**Static Language vs Dynamic Language**

For static languages (e.g., Java), if you need to pass in an `Animal` type, then the object must be `Animal` type or its subclass, otherwise, the `run()` method cannot be called.

For dynamic languages like Python, there's no strict need to pass an `Animal` type. We just need to ensure the passed object has a `run()` method:

```python
class Timer(object):
    def run(self):
        print('Start...')
```

This is known as "duck typing" in dynamic languages - it doesn't require a strict inheritance hierarchy. An object only needs to "look like a duck, walk like a duck," then it can be regarded as a duck.

Python's "file-like object" is an example of duck typing. For real file objects, they have a `read()` method that returns their content. However, many objects, as long as they have a `read()` method, are treated as "file-like objects". Many functions accept parameters that are "file-like objects", and you don't necessarily have to pass in a real file object. You can pass in any object that implements the `read()` method.
