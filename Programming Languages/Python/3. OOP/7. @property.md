When binding properties, exposing them directly is simple, but it doesn't allow parameter checking, leading to potentially illogical modifications like `s.score = 9999`. To prevent this, we can use a `set_score()` method for setting scores and a `get_score()` method for retrieving scores, enabling parameter checks within `set_score()`:

```python
class Student(object):

    def get_score(self):
         return self._score

    def set_score(self, value):
        if not isinstance(value, int):
            raise ValueError('score must be an integer!')
        if value < 0 or value > 100:
            raise ValueError('score must be between 0 ~ 100!')
        self._score = value
```

This approach ensures that you can't arbitrarily set `score`, but it's slightly complex compared to directly using properties.

Is there a way to check parameters and access class variables as simply as accessing properties? For perfection-seeking Python programmers, achieving this is a must!

Remember how decorators can dynamically add functionality to functions? Decorators work with class methods too. Python's built-in `@property` decorator is designed to turn a method call into property access:

```python
class Student(object):

    @property
    def score(self):
        return self._score

    @score.setter
    def score(self, value):
        if not isinstance(value, int):
            raise ValueError('score must be an integer!')
        if value < 0 or value > 100:
            raise ValueError('score must be between 0 ~ 100!')
        self._score = value
```

By using `@property`, a getter method can be turned into a property, allowing for controlled attribute access:

```python
>>> s = Student()
>>> s.score = 60  # OK, actually calls s.set_score(60)
>>> s.score  # OK, actually calls s.get_score()
60
>>> s.score = 9999
Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
ValueError: score must be between 0 ~ 100!
```

`@property` lets you interact with the attribute, suggesting it's implemented through getters and setters.

Read-only properties can also be defined by only creating a getter method without a setter:

```python
class Student(object):

    @property
    def birth(self):
        return self._birth

    @birth.setter
    def birth(self, value):
        self._birth = value

    @property
    def age(self):
        return 2015 - self._birth
```

`birth` is read-write, while `age` is read-only, calculated from `birth` and the current year.

Note: Avoid naming method and instance variables the same. The following code is incorrect:

```python
class Student(object):

    @property
    def birth(self):
        return self.birth
```

This results in infinite recursion when accessing `s.birth`, causing a stack overflow error (`RecursionError`).
