```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return 'Hello, World!'
```

In this code, we define a new Flask app and map the root URL (`/`) to a Python function called `index()`. When the user visits the root URL, Flask will call the `index()` function and return the string `Hello, World!`.

We can also map a URL to a function that takes input parameters. For example:

```python
@app.route('/greet/<name>')
def greet(name):
    return f'Hello, {name}!'
```

In this code, we define a new URL (`/greet/<name>`) that takes a parameter `name`. When the user visits this URL, Flask will call the `greet()` function and pass the `name` parameter as an argument. The function will then return a personalized greeting.

We can also use HTTP methods like `POST`, `GET`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` to map URLs to different functions that handle different types of requests. For example:

```python
@app.route('/add', methods=['POST'])
def add():
    # Add your Python code here
    return 'Addition successful'

@app.route('/subtract', methods=['POST'])
def subtract():
    # Add your Python code here
    return 'Subtraction successful'
```

In this code, we define two new URLs (`/add` and `/subtract`) that handle `POST` requests. When the user visits these URLs and sends a `POST` request, Flask will call the corresponding function (`add()` or `subtract()`) to handle the request.

Overall, URL and view mapping is a fundamental concept in Flask development. By mapping URLs to Python functions, you can create a web application with a clean and organized structure, making it easy to manage and maintain.
