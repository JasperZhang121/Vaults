### Basic Data Types

#### Integers

Go supports both signed and unsigned integers in various sizes:

- `int`: Platform-dependent size (either 32 or 64 bits).
- `int8`, `int16`, `int32`, `int64`: Signed integers of specific sizes.
- `uint`: Platform-dependent size (either 32 or 64 bits).
- `uint8`, `uint16`, `uint32`, `uint64`: Unsigned integers of specific sizes.
- `uintptr`: An unsigned integer large enough to store the uninterpreted bits of a pointer value.

##### Example

```go
var a int = 10
var b int32 = 20
var c uint = 30
var d uint64 = 40
```

#### Floating Point Numbers

Go supports floating point numbers with IEEE-754 standard representation:

- `float32`: 32-bit floating point numbers.
- `float64`: 64-bit floating point numbers.

##### Example

```go
var x float32 = 3.14
var y float64 = 2.71828
```

#### Complex Numbers

Go has built-in support for complex numbers:

- `complex64`: Complex numbers with `float32` real and imaginary parts.
- `complex128`: Complex numbers with `float64` real and imaginary parts.

##### Example

```go
var c1 complex64 = 1 + 2i
var c2 complex128 = 2 + 3i
```

#### Boolean

The `bool` type represents a boolean value, which can be either `true` or `false`.

##### Example

```go
var isGoFun bool = true
```

#### Strings

Strings in Go are immutable sequences of bytes, typically representing Unicode text.

##### Example

```go
var greeting string = "Hello, World!"
```

#### Rune

A `rune` is an alias for `int32` and is used to represent a Unicode code point.

##### Example

```go
var r rune = 'a'
```

### Composite Data Types

#### Arrays

An array is a fixed-size, ordered collection of elements of the same type.

##### Example

```go
var arr [5]int = [5]int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
```

#### Explanation

- `var arr [5]int`: Declares an array `arr` of type `int` with a length of 5.

#### Slices

Slices are dynamically-sized, flexible views into arrays. They provide a more powerful and convenient way to work with sequences of elements.

##### Example

```go
var s []int = []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
s = append(s, 6)
```

#### Explanation

- `var s []int`: Declares a slice `s` of type `int`.
- `s = append(s, 6)`: Appends the value 6 to the slice `s`.

#### Maps

Maps are unordered collections of key-value pairs. Keys must be unique and of a type that is comparable (e.g., strings, integers).

##### Example

```go
var m map[string]int = map[string]int{"Alice": 25, "Bob": 30}
```

#### Explanation

- `var m map[string]int`: Declares a map `m` with `string` keys and `int` values.
- `map[string]int{"Alice": 25, "Bob": 30}`: Initializes the map with two key-value pairs.

#### Structs

Structs are composite data types that group together variables under a single name. Each variable within a struct is called a field.

##### Example

```go
type Person struct {
    Name string
    Age  int
}

var p Person = Person{Name: "Alice", Age: 25}
```

#### Explanation

- `type Person struct { ... }`: Defines a new struct type `Person` with two fields: `Name` and `Age`.
- `var p Person`: Declares a variable `p` of type `Person`.
- `Person{Name: "Alice", Age: 25}`: Initializes the struct with field values.

### Type Aliases and Custom Types

Go allows the creation of type aliases and custom types for more readable and maintainable code.

#### Type Aliases

A type alias provides an alternative name for an existing type.

##### Example

```go
type Age int

var myAge Age = 30
```

#### Custom Types

Custom types allow the creation of new types based on existing ones.

##### Example

```go
type Celsius float64

var temp Celsius = 36.6
```

### Type Conversions

Go does not support implicit type conversions. Explicit type conversions are required to convert values from one type to another.

##### Example

```go
var a int = 42
var b float64 = float64(a)
var c uint = uint(b)
```

#### Explanation

- `float64(a)`: Converts the integer `a` to a `float64`.
- `uint(b)`: Converts the float `b` to a `uint`.

### Pointers

Pointers store the memory addresses of other variables. They are useful for referencing values without copying them.

#### Declaring Pointers

```go
var x int = 10
var p *int = &x
```

#### Explanation

- `var p *int`: Declares a pointer `p` to an integer.
- `&x`: Gets the memory address of the variable `x`.

#### Dereferencing Pointers

Dereferencing a pointer means accessing the value stored at the memory address it points to.

##### Example

```go
fmt.Println(*p) // Output: 10
```

#### Explanation

- `*p`: Dereferences the pointer `p` to access the value of `x`.
