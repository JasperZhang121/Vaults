### Declaring Constants

Constants are declared similarly to variables but use the `const` keyword instead of `var`.

#### Example

```go
const Pi = 3.14
const Greeting = "Hello, World!"
const IsGoFun = true
```

### Explanation

- `const Pi = 3.14`: Declares a constant `Pi` of type `float64` with the value 3.14.
- `const Greeting = "Hello, World!"`: Declares a constant `Greeting` of type `string` with the value "Hello, World!".
- `const IsGoFun = true`: Declares a constant `IsGoFun` of type `bool` with the value `true`.

## Typed and Untyped Constants

Constants can be either typed or untyped. Untyped constants are more flexible as they can be used in different contexts without explicit conversion.

### Untyped Constants

Untyped constants do not have a specific type until they are assigned to a variable.

#### Example

```go
const x = 42
var y int = x
var z float64 = x
```

#### Explanation

- `const x = 42`: Declares an untyped constant `x` with the value 42.
- `var y int = x`: Assigns the constant `x` to an integer variable `y`.
- `var z float64 = x`: Assigns the constant `x` to a float64 variable `z`.

### Typed Constants

Typed constants have a specific type and are less flexible but can be useful for ensuring type safety.

#### Example

```go
const x int = 42
// var y float64 = x // This would cause a compile-time error
```

#### Explanation

- `const x int = 42`: Declares a typed constant `x` of type `int` with the value 42.
- `var y float64 = x`: This line would cause a compile-time error because `x` is explicitly typed as `int`.

### Multiple Constants

Multiple constants can be declared together using a block.

#### Example

```go
const (
    Pi      = 3.14159
    E       = 2.71828
    Version = "1.0.0"
)
```

#### Explanation

- `const (...)`: Declares multiple constants within a block.
- `Pi`, `E`, and `Version` are constants of different types declared together.

### Enumerated Constants

Enumerated constants are a set of related constants that are often used to represent a collection of related values, such as days of the week or error codes.

#### Example

```go
const (
    Sunday = iota
    Monday
    Tuesday
    Wednesday
    Thursday
    Friday
    Saturday
)
```

#### Explanation

- `const (...)`: Declares a block of constants.
- `iota`: A special identifier in Go that increments by 1 for each item in the block, starting from 0.

### Using `iota` for Bitwise Operations

The `iota` identifier is often used in combination with bitwise operations to create constants with specific bit patterns.

#### Example

```go
const (
    Read    = 1 << iota // 1 << 0 == 1
    Write               // 1 << 1 == 2
    Execute             // 1 << 2 == 4
)
```

#### Explanation

- `1 << iota`: Uses bit shifting to set each constant to a different power of 2.
- `Read`, `Write`, and `Execute` are constants with values 1, 2, and 4, respectively.

### Constant Expressions

Constants can be defined using expressions, as long as the expression results in a value that can be determined at compile time.

#### Example

```go
const (
    Length = 10
    Width  = 5
    Area   = Length * Width
)
```

#### Explanation

- `Length` and `Width` are constants with values 10 and 5, respectively.
- `Area` is a constant defined as the product of `Length` and `Width`.
