### DOM (Document Object Model)

- The DOM is a <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">programming interface</mark> for web documents.
- It represents the structure of an HTML or XML document as a tree-like object model.
- The DOM allows manipulation of the document's elements, attributes, and content using JavaScript.
- Key DOM methods and properties include getElementById, getElementsByTagName, innerHTML, and parentNode.

### BOM (Browser Object Model)

- The BOM represents the browser itself as an object model, providing access to browser-specific features and functionality.
- It includes objects like window, navigator, location, history, and screen.
- The window object is the top-level object in the BOM, representing the browser window or tab.
- The navigator object provides information about the browser and its capabilities.
- The location object allows manipulation of the current URL.
- The history object allows navigation through the browser's history.
- The screen object provides information about the user's screen.

### Interaction between DOM and BOM

- The DOM and BOM often work together to create dynamic and interactive web pages.
- JavaScript can be used to manipulate the DOM to modify the content and structure of a webpage.
- The BOM provides additional functionality to interact with the browser and control its behavior.
- For example, using the DOM, you can modify the content of an HTML element, while the BOM allows you to open a new browser window or navigate to a different URL.

### Common use cases for DOM and BOM

- DOM: Manipulating HTML elements, handling events, dynamically updating page content, and creating interactive user interfaces.
- BOM: Managing browser behavior, controlling window properties, handling navigation, and working with browser-specific features like geolocation.
