Detailed Notes for DOM (Document Object Model):

The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents, representing the structure of an HTML or XML document as a tree-like object model. It allows developers to interact with the elements, attributes, and content of a web page using JavaScript.

Key Concepts:

1. Document:
- The document object represents the entire web page and serves as an entry point to access other DOM elements.
- It provides methods and properties to manipulate the structure and content of the document.

2. Elements:
- Elements are the building blocks of the web page, such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, forms, and more.
- They are represented as nodes in the DOM tree and can be accessed and modified using various methods and properties.

3. Traversing the DOM:
- The DOM allows traversal from one element to another, moving up, down, and sideways within the tree structure.
- Methods like parentNode, childNodes, nextSibling, previousSibling, and querySelector help navigate through the DOM.

4. Modifying Elements:
- The DOM provides methods and properties to modify the attributes, content, and style of elements dynamically.

5. Event Handling:
- The DOM allows the registration of event listeners to respond to user interactions or specific events triggered on elements.

```javascript
//Example 1:
// Access the document title and modify it
document.title = "New Page Title";

//Example 2:
// Access an element by its ID and modify its content
var heading = document.getElementById("myHeading");
heading.innerHTML = "New Heading Text";

//Example 3:
// Access the parent and next sibling of an element
var paragraph = document.getElementById("myParagraph");
var parentElement = paragraph.parentNode;
var nextSiblingElement = paragraph.nextSibling;

//Example 4:
// Change the background color and add a CSS class to an element
var button = document.getElementById("myButton");
button.style.backgroundColor = "red";
button.classList.add("highlight");

//Example 5:
// Add a click event listener to a button
var button = document.getElementById("myButton");
button.addEventListener("click", function() {
  alert("Button clicked!");
});
