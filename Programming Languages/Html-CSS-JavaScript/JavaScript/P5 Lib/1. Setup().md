In p5.js, the `setup()` function is a fundamental function used to set up the initial environment and settings for your sketch. It is called once when your sketch starts and is typically used for initializing variables, defining the canvas size, and configuring other settings that need to be set up only once at the beginning of your program.

```javascript
function setup() {
  // Initialization code goes here
}
```

1. **Canvas Creation:** You start by creating a canvas using the `createCanvas()` function. This function defines the size of your sketch's display area, specifying its width and height in pixels. For example:
```js
function setup() {
  createCanvas(800, 600); // Creates a canvas of width 800 pixels and height 600 pixels
}
```

2. **Variable Initialization:** You initialize variables that you will use throughout your sketch. This might include initial positions of objects, colors, speeds, or any other parameters needed for your animations or interactivity.
```js
function setup() {
  createCanvas(800, 600);
  let x = 100; // Initialize x-coordinate of an object
  let y = 200; // Initialize y-coordinate of an object
  let speedX = 2; // Initialize speed in the x-direction
}
```

3. **Setting Background Color:** You can set the background color of your canvas using the `background()` function. This function takes either an RGB or HSB color value to define the background color.
```js
function setup() {
  createCanvas(800, 600);
  background(220); // Sets the background color to a light gray
}
```
