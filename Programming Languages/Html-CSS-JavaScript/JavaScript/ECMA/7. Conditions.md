**if statement:**
- The `if` statement is used for conditional execution of code based on a specified condition.
- It allows you to execute a block of code if the condition evaluates to `true`.
- You can optionally use `else if` and `else` clauses for alternative conditions.


```javascript
let num = 10;

if (num > 0) {
  console.log("Number is positive.");
} else if (num < 0) {
  console.log("Number is negative.");
} else {
  console.log("Number is zero.");
}
```


**for loop:**
- The `for` loop is used to repeatedly execute a block of code for a specified number of times.
- It consists of an initialization, condition, and iteration statement.

```javascript

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
```


**switch statement:**
- The `switch` statement provides a way to execute different code blocks based on different conditions or values.
- It evaluates an expression and compares it against multiple cases.

```javascript
let fruit = "apple";

switch (fruit) {
  case "apple":
    console.log("It's an apple.");
    break;
  case "banana":
    console.log("It's a banana.");
    break;
  default:
    console.log("It's an unknown fruit.");
}
```
