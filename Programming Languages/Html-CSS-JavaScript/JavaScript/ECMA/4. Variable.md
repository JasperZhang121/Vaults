- Variables are used to store and manipulate data in JavaScript.
- To declare a variable, use the `let`, `const`, or `var` keyword, followed by the variable name.
- Variables can store various types of data, including numbers, strings, booleans, objects, arrays, and more.
- Variables can be assigned values using the assignment operator `=`.
- Variables can be used in expressions and operations.
- Variables can be reassigned with new values during the program execution.
- It's good practice to use descriptive names for variables that reflect their purpose and meaning in the code.

Examples:
```html
    <script>
        var age = 3,
            name = 'jasper';

        console.log(age,name);
        var username = prompt("please enter you name!");
        alert("oh! you are "+ username+"asshole? It does not matter anyway....");
        alert("by the way, I'm " + name+"."+" and I'm "+age+" years old.");
    </script>
```

```javascript
// Declare variables
let firstName = "John";
let lastName = "Doe";
const age = 25;
var isStudent = true;

// Use variables in expressions
let fullName = firstName + " " + lastName;
let message = "Hello, " + fullName + "! You are " + age + " years old.";

// Print output
console.log(message); // Output: Hello, John Doe! You are 25 years old.

// Modify variables
isStudent = false;
age += 1;

// Update output
message = "Hello, " + fullName + "! You are now " + age + " years old and not a student.";

// Print updated output
console.log(message); // Output: Hello, John Doe! You are now 26 years old and not a student.
