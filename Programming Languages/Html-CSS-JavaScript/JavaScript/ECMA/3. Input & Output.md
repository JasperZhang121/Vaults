Input:

- JavaScript provides various ways to receive input from users.
- The most common way is to use the `prompt()` function, which displays a dialog box with a message and waits for the user to enter a value. The entered value is returned as a string.

Example:

```javascript
let name = prompt("Enter your name:"); // Prompts the user for their name
```

Output:

- JavaScript offers different methods to display output to users.
- The `console.log()` function is commonly used for debugging or displaying information in the browser's console.

Example:

```javascript
let message = "Hello, world!";
console.log(message); // Outputs "Hello, world!" to the console
```
To display content directly on a web page, you can manipulate the HTML using JavaScript. One popular method is to modify the `textContent` or `innerHTML` property of an HTML element.

```javascript
let greetingElement = document.getElementById("greeting");
greetingElement.textContent = "Hello, world!"; // Displays "Hello, world!" on the webpage
```

- You can also dynamically create new HTML elements and append them to the document.

Example:

```javascript
let newElement = document.createElement("p");
newElement.textContent = "This is a new paragraph.";
document.body.appendChild(newElement); // Adds the new paragraph to the document body
```

- Additionally, JavaScript supports the `alert()` function to display a pop-up dialog box with a message to the user.

Example:
```javascript
alert("Welcome to my website!"); // Displays a pop-up with the given message
```


document.write(content)

- `document.write(content)` is a JavaScript method that allows you to write content directly into the HTML document.
- The `content` parameter can be a string of text or HTML markup.
- When `document.write()` is called, the content is written to the document at the location of the script tag or where the method is called.
- It's important to use `document.write()` with caution, as calling it after the HTML document has finished loading can overwrite the existing content and cause unexpected results.
- In modern web development, it's generally recommended to use other techniques like DOM manipulation methods to dynamically add or modify content on a webpage.
