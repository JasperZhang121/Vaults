- `const` is a keyword used to declare a constant variable in JavaScript.
- Once a value is assigned to a `const` variable, it cannot be reassigned or modified.
- `const` variables have block scope, meaning they are only accessible within the block where they are defined.
- It's good practice to use `const` for variables that are intended to be constant and not modified.
- When declaring a `const` variable, you must assign a value to it during declaration; otherwise, it will result in an error.
- `const` variables follow the same rules of variable naming conventions as other variables in JavaScript.

```javascript
const PI = 3.14159; // Declaration of a constant variable 'PI'

const name = "John"; // Declaration of a constant variable 'name'
// name = "Jane"; // Error: Assignment to constant variable

if (true) {
  const age = 25; // Declaration of a constant variable 'age' within a block
  console.log(age); // Output: 25
}

// console.log(age); // Error: age is not defined outside the block
```
While the value of a `const` variable is immutable, it doesn't mean that the data it holds is itself immutable. If the `const` variable contains an object or an array, the properties or elements of that object or array can still be modified.
