JavaScript comments are used to add explanatory notes within your code. These comments are not executed as part of the program and are purely meant for human readers. There are two main types of comments in JavaScript:

1. Single-line comments:
    
    - Single-line comments start with `//`.
    - They are used for short comments or explanations on a single line.
    - Anything after `//` on the same line is considered a comment and is ignored by the JavaScript interpreter.
    
    Example:

```javascript
// This is a single-line comment
let greeting = "Hello, world!"; // Initializing the greeting variable
``` 
   
    
2. Multi-line comments:
    
    - Multi-line comments start with `/*` and end with `*/`.
    - They are used for longer comments or explanations spanning multiple lines.
    - Everything between `/*` and `*/` is considered a comment and is ignored by the JavaScript interpreter.
    
    Example:

```javascript
/*
This is a multi-line comment.
It can span multiple lines and is useful for longer explanations or documenting your code.
*/

let name = "John";
/* The above line declares a variable named 'name' and assigns it the value "John" */
```
