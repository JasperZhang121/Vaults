  Assembly language is a low-level programming language that represents machine code instructions in a human-readable form. It provides a direct correspondence between the instructions and the underlying hardware, making it ideal for tasks that require fine-grained control over the system's resources. Here is a detailed explanation of the basic knowledge and syntax of assembly language:

- Registers: Assembly language utilizes processor registers, which are small storage locations within the CPU. These registers are used for temporary storage, calculations, and data manipulation.
- Instructions: Assembly language instructions represent individual operations that the CPU can perform. These instructions are typically mnemonic representations of machine code instructions.
- Memory: Assembly language can access and manipulate data stored in the memory. Memory is typically addressed using memory addresses.
