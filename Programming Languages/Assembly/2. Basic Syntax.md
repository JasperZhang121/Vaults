- Labels: Labels are used to mark specific locations in the code. They provide a way to refer to these locations for branching or data access. Labels are typically followed by a colon (e.g., `my_label:`).
- Comments: Comments are used to add explanatory notes to the code and are ignored by the assembler. They are typically preceded by a semicolon (e.g., `; This is a comment`).
- Instructions: Assembly language instructions specify operations to be performed by the CPU. Instructions consist of an operation mnemonic followed by operands (if required). For example, `mov` is an instruction that moves data between registers or memory locations.
- Registers: Assembly language uses registers for storing data. Registers are referenced by their names, such as `eax`, `ebx`, `ecx`, etc.
- Operands: Operands are the inputs to instructions. They can be registers, memory addresses, immediate values, or labels.
- Directives: Directives provide instructions to the assembler, but they do not generate machine code instructions. They are used for tasks such as defining constants, reserving memory, or including external files.

### Example
```asm
section .data
    number1 db 10   ; Define a byte (8 bits) variable and initialize it to 10
    number2 db 5    ; Define another byte variable and initialize it to 5

section .text
    global _start
_start:
    mov al, [number1]  ; Move the value of number1 into the al register
    add al, [number2] ; Add the value of number2 to the al register
    ; The sum is now stored in the al register

    ; Perform further operations or display the result
    ; ...
    ; Terminate the program
    mov eax, 1    ; Prepare the exit syscall number
    xor ebx, ebx  ; Set the exit status to 0
    int 0x80      ; Invoke the syscall
```

- The `.data` section is used to declare variables.
- The `.text` section contains the actual executable code.
- The `mov` instruction moves the value from memory to the `al` register.
- The `add` instruction adds the value from memory to the `al` register.
- The program terminates by invoking the `exit` system call.
