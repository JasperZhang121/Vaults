### Output in Java

In Java, `System.out.println()` is commonly used for output to the screen. `println` is an abbreviation for "print line", which means output and then move to the next line. If you don't want a newline, you can use `System.out.print()`:

```java
// Output Example
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.print("A,");
        System.out.print("B,");
        System.out.print("C.");
        System.out.println();
        System.out.println("END");
    }
}
```

### Formatted Output

Java also provides the ability for formatted output. For example, to display data in a specific format, you use `System.out.printf()` with format specifiers:

```java
// Formatted Output
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double d = 3.1415926;
        System.out.printf("%.2f\n", d); // Displays two decimal places: 3.14
        System.out.printf("%.4f\n", d); // Displays four decimal places: 3.1416
    }
}
```

Format specifiers include:
- `%d`: Integer
- `%x`: Hexadecimal integer
- `%f`: Floating-point number
- `%e`: Scientific notation
- `%s`: String

Note: Two consecutive `%` symbols (`%%`) represent a literal `%` character.

### Input in Java

Input in Java is more complex than output. Here's an example of reading a string and an integer from the console:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in); // Create a Scanner object
        System.out.print("Input your name: "); // Print prompt
        String name = scanner.nextLine(); // Read a line of input and get a string
        System.out.print("Input your age: "); // Print prompt
        int age = scanner.nextInt(); // Read a line of input and get an integer
        System.out.printf("Hi, %s, you are %d\n", name, age); // Formatted output
    }
}
```

In this example:
- We import `java.util.Scanner`.
- Create a `Scanner` object with `System.in`.
- Use `scanner.nextLine()` to read a string and `scanner.nextInt()` to read an integer.
- Note that this code can't be run online and should be compiled and executed in a command-line environment.

### Conditional Statements in Java

Java uses `if` statements to execute code based on conditions. The basic syntax is:

```java
if (condition) {
    // Execute when condition is met
}
```

If the condition evaluates to `true`, the JVM executes the code block inside the `if` statement.

Example:

```java
// Conditional Judgment
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 70;
        if (n >= 60) {
            System.out.println("Passed");
        }
        System.out.println("END");
    }
}
```

You can also have multiple statements inside an `if` block, and if the block contains only one statement, the braces `{}` can be omitted, but it's not always a good idea to omit them.

### `else` and `else if`

The `if` statement can be followed by an `else` block, which is executed when the `if` condition is `false`.

```java
// Conditional Judgment with else
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 70;
        if (n >= 60) {
            System.out.println("Passed");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Failed");
        }
        System.out.println("END");
    }
}
```

You can chain multiple conditions using `else if`:

```java
// Conditional Judgment with else if
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 70;
        if (n >= 90) {
            System.out.println("Excellent");
        } else if (n >= 60) {
            System.out.println("Passed");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Failed");
        }
        System.out.println("END");
    }
}
```

Be careful with the order of `if` and `else if` conditions.

### Floating-Point Comparison

Due to precision issues with floating-point numbers, use a small threshold to check equality:

```java
// Floating-Point Comparison
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double x = 1 - 9.0 / 10;
        if (Math.abs(x - 0.1) < 0.00001) {
            System.out.println("x is approximately 0.1");
        } else {
            System.out.println("x is NOT 0.1");
        }
    }
}
```

### Comparing Reference Types

For reference types, `==` checks if two references point to the same object. Use `equals()` to compare the content of objects:

```java
// Reference Type Comparison
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String s1 = "hello";
        String s2 = "HELLO".toLowerCase();
        if (s1.equals(s2)) {
            System.out.println("s1 equals s2");
        } else {
            System.out.println("s1 does not equal s2");
        }
    }
}
```

To prevent `NullPointerException`, check for `null` before calling `equals()`:

```java
// Null Check before Comparison
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String s1 = null;
        if (s1 != null && s1.equals("hello")) {
            System.out.println("hello");
        }
    }
}
```

Alternatively, reverse the order in the `equals()` method:

```java
if ("hello".equals(s1)) {
    // ...
}
```


### Switch Statement in Java

The `switch` statement in Java is used for decision making based on the result of an expression. It jumps to the matching `case` result, then continues executing the subsequent statements until it encounters a `break` to end the execution.

#### Basic Usage of Switch

```java
// Switch Example
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int option = 1;
        switch (option) {
            case 1:
                System.out.println("Selected 1");
                break;
            case 2:
                System.out.println("Selected 2");
                break;
            case 3:
                System.out.println("Selected 3");
                break;
        }
    }
}
```

#### Default Case

You can add a `default` case to handle situations where no `case` matches:

```java
// Switch with Default
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int option = 99;
        switch (option) {
            case 1:
                System.out.println("Selected 1");
                break;
            case 2:
                System.out.println("Selected 2");
                break;
            case 3:
                System.out.println("Selected 3");
                break;
            default:
                System.out.println("Not selected");
                break;
        }
    }
}
```

#### Switch Without Break

Be cautious with the "fall-through" behavior in switch statements. If you forget to include a `break`, subsequent `case` blocks will be executed until a `break` is encountered.

#### Switch with String

Switch statements can also match against strings:

```java
// Switch with String
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String fruit = "apple";
        switch (fruit) {
            case "apple":
                System.out.println("Selected apple");
                break;
            case "pear":
                System.out.println("Selected pear");
                break;
            case "mango":
                System.out.println("Selected mango");
                break;
            default:
                System.out.println("No fruit selected");
                break;
        }
    }
}
```

#### Enhanced Switch (Java 12+)

From Java 12 onwards, switch expressions have been enhanced to prevent fall-through and to allow returning values directly:

```java
// Enhanced Switch
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String fruit = "apple";
        int opt = switch (fruit) {
            case "apple" -> 1;
            case "pear", "mango" -> 2;
            default -> 0;
        };
        System.out.println("opt = " + opt);
    }
}
```

In this new syntax, `->` is used, and if there are multiple statements, they need to be enclosed in `{}`. There's no need for `break` as there's no fall-through.

#### Using `yield` in Switch

For complex switch expressions, you can use multiple statements within `{}` and return a value using `yield`:

```java
// Using yield in Switch
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String fruit = "orange";
        int opt = switch (fruit) {
            case "apple" -> 1;
            case "pear", "mango" -> 2;
            default -> {
                int code = fruit.hashCode();
                yield code; // Returns value from switch
            }
        };
        System.out.println("opt = " + opt);
    }
}
```

### Loop Statements in Java

Loop statements allow a computer to perform repetitive calculations. The loop continues as long as a condition is satisfied and stops when it is not.

#### Using `while` Loops

The `while` loop in Java is used to repeatedly execute a block of statements as long as a condition is true. The basic syntax is:

```java
while (condition) {
    // Loop body
}
// Continue with the rest of the code
```

Before each iteration, the loop checks if the condition is true. If so, it executes the loop body. If the condition is false, the loop ends.

Example of using a `while` loop to sum numbers from 1 to 100:

```java
// While Loop Example
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int sum = 0; // Initialize sum to 0
        int n = 1;
        while (n <= 100) { // Loop condition
            sum = sum + n; // Add n to sum
            n++; // Increment n
        }
        System.out.println(sum); // Outputs 5050
    }
}
```

Note that the `while` loop might not execute at all if the condition is false initially. Pay close attention to the loop condition and increment operations to avoid off-by-one errors and infinite loops.

#### Potential Issues with `while` Loops

- **Off-by-One Error**: An error in the loop's logic can lead to incorrect results.
- **Infinite Loops**: If the loop condition is always true, the loop becomes an infinite loop, causing high CPU usage.

Example of a potential infinite loop issue:

```java
// While Loop with Potential Issue
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int sum = 0;
        int n = 1;
        while (n > 0) {
            sum = sum + n;
            n++;
        }
        System.out.println(n); // Eventually becomes negative due to overflow
        System.out.println(sum);
    }
}
```

In this case, `n` eventually becomes negative due to integer overflow, causing an unexpected exit from the loop.

### `do while` Loops in Java

In Java, the `do while` loop is a variant of the `while` loop that executes the loop body first, then checks the condition. If the condition is true, the loop continues; otherwise, it exits. The syntax is:

```java
do {
    // Loop body
} while (condition);
```

A `do while` loop guarantees that the loop body will be executed at least once.

#### Example: Summing Numbers with `do while`

Here's how you can rewrite the sum from 1 to 100 using a `do while` loop:

```java
// Do-While Loop Example
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int sum = 0;
        int n = 1;
        do {
            sum = sum + n;
            n++;
        } while (n <= 100);
        System.out.println(sum);
    }
}
```

When using a `do while` loop, pay attention to the loop condition to ensure correct execution.

#### Exercise: Calculate the Sum from `m` to `n` Using `do while`

Rewrite the exercise to calculate the sum from `m` to `n` using a `do while` loop:

```java
// Do-While Loop Exercise
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int sum = 0;
        int m = 20;
        int n = 100;
        // Use do-while loop to calculate the sum from m to n:
        do {
            sum += m;
            m++;
        } while (m <= n);
        System.out.println(sum);
    }
}
```

In this exercise, the `do while` loop is used to add each number from `m` to `n` inclusively. The loop runs at least once and continues as long as `m` is less than or equal to `n`.

### `for` Loop in Java

The `for` loop in Java is widely used for iterating with a counter. It initializes a counter, checks a condition before each iteration, and updates the counter after each iteration. The counter variable is often named `i`.

#### Example: Summing Numbers with `for` Loop

```java
// For Loop Example
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
            sum = sum + i;
        }
        System.out.println(sum);
    }
}
```

The `for` loop's syntax is:

```java
for (initial condition; loop check condition; counter update) {
    // Statements
}
```

#### Array Summation Example with `for` Loop

```java
// For Loop with Array
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] ns = { 1, 4, 9, 16, 25 };
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < ns.length; i++) {
            sum = sum + ns[i];
        }
        System.out.println("sum = " + sum);
    }
}
```

In this example, the loop iterates over each element of the array using the counter `i`.

#### Avoid Modifying the Counter Inside the Loop

It's important not to modify the counter variable inside the loop body as it can lead to unexpected behavior or logic errors.

#### Scope of the Counter Variable

The counter variable `i` should ideally be defined within the `for` loop to limit its scope:

```java
// Scope of Counter Variable
int[] ns = { 1, 4, 9, 16, 25 };
for (int i = 0; i < ns.length; i++) {
    System.out.println(ns[i]);
}
// i is not accessible here
```

#### Flexible Use of `for` Loops

The `for` loop can omit the initialization, condition, or update statement, but it is generally not recommended to omit these unless necessary.

### `for each` Loop in Java

The `for each` loop is used to iterate over arrays or collections more simply. It directly accesses each element without using an index.

#### Example: Iterating Over an Array with `for each` Loop

```java
// For Each Loop
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] ns = { 1, 4, 9, 16, 25 };
        for (int n : ns) {
            System.out.println(n);
        }
    }
}
```

Compared to a traditional `for` loop, `for each` is more concise and easy to read. However, it does not allow specifying the iteration order or accessing the index of elements. `for each` is also applicable to other iterable data types, such as `List` and `Map`, which will be covered later.

### `break` Statement in Java

The `break` statement is used to exit the current loop. It is typically used in conjunction with an `if` statement. Note that `break` will only exit the loop in which it resides.

#### Example of `break`

```java
// Break Example
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 1; ; i++) {
            sum = sum + i;
            if (i == 100) {
                break; // Exit the loop when i equals 100
            }
        }
        System.out.println(sum); // Outputs the sum
    }
}
```

In nested loops, `break` exits only the innermost loop that contains it.

### `continue` Statement in Java

The `continue` statement skips the current iteration and proceeds to the next iteration of the loop. It's used to skip certain steps in the loop under specific conditions.

#### Example of `continue`

```java
// Continue Example
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
            System.out.println("begin i = " + i);
            if (i % 2 == 0) {
                continue; // Skip the rest of the loop if i is even
            }
            sum = sum + i;
            System.out.println("end i = " + i);
        }
        System.out.println(sum); // Outputs the sum of odd numbers
    }
}
```

When `i` is even, the `continue` statement skips the remaining part of the loop for that iteration. As a result, "end i = 2" is not printed.

In nested loops, `continue` affects only the loop in which it is placed.

`break` and `continue` are powerful tools for controlling loop execution in Java. `break` is used to completely exit a loop, while `continue` is used to skip the current iteration and move to the next one. Both should be used carefully to avoid creating infinite loops or other unintended behaviors.

### Two-Dimensional Arrays in Java

A two-dimensional array is an array of arrays. Here's how you define a two-dimensional array:

```java
// Two-Dimensional Arrays
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[][] ns = {
            { 1, 2, 3, 4 },
            { 5, 6, 7, 8 },
            { 9, 10, 11, 12 }
        };
        System.out.println(ns.length); // Output: 3
    }
}
```

`ns.length` is 3 because `ns` contains 3 arrays. Each array element within `ns` can be accessed using array indexing like `ns[row][col]`.

#### Accessing Elements

```java
System.out.println(ns[1][2]); // Output: 7
```

#### Irregular Two-Dimensional Arrays

Two-dimensional arrays in Java can have subarrays of different lengths:

```java
int[][] ns = {
    { 1, 2, 3, 4 },
    { 5, 6 },
    { 7, 8, 9 }
};
```

#### Printing Two-Dimensional Arrays

To print a two-dimensional array, use nested loops or `Arrays.deepToString()`:

```java
// Printing Two-Dimensional Arrays
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[][] ns = {
            { 1, 2, 3, 4 },
            { 5, 6, 7, 8 },
            { 9, 10, 11, 12 }
        };
        System.out.println(Arrays.deepToString(ns));
    }
}
```

### Three-Dimensional Arrays in Java

A three-dimensional array is an array of two-dimensional arrays. You can define a three-dimensional array like this:

```java
int[][][] ns = {
    {
        {1, 2, 3},
        {4, 5, 6},
        {7, 8, 9}
    },
    {
        {10, 11},
        {12, 13}
    },
    {
        {14, 15, 16},
        {17, 18}
    }
};
```

#### Accessing Elements in Three-Dimensional Arrays

To access an element in a three-dimensional array, you can use indexing like `ns[i][j][k]`.

#### Higher-Dimensional Arrays

While you can theoretically create N-dimensional arrays, in practice, arrays beyond two dimensions are rarely used.
