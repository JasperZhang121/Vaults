### Why is Java the Most Widely Used?

From the internet to enterprise platforms, Java is the most widely used programming language, for reasons such as:

- **Java is a cross-platform language based on the JVM (Java Virtual Machine)**, which allows for '<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">write once, run anywhere</mark>' capabilities;

- **Java programs are easy to write**, and they include built-in <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">garbage collection</mark>, eliminating the need to worry about memory management;

- **The Java Virtual Machine offers industrial-level stability and highly optimized performance**, and it has stood the test of time;

- **Java has the broadest support from the open-source community**, making various high-quality components readily available.

### Java consistently dominates three major markets:

- **Internet and enterprise applications**, where <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Java EE</mark> has a long-standing advantage and market position;

- **Big data platforms**, primarily including Hadoop, Spark, Flink, etc., which are developed in Java or Scala (a programming language that runs on the JVM);

- **The Android mobile platform.**

### The Origin and Evolution of Java

Java was initially developed in the early 1990s by <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">James Gosling</mark> at Sun Microsystems (now acquired by Oracle) and was originally named Oak, targeting embedded applications for small appliances. However, it didn't gain much traction in the market. With the rise of the internet, Oak was revitalized and rebranded as Java by Sun Microsystems in 1995, since the name Oak was already registered. Java became the most important programming language for the internet as it evolved rapidly.

#### Java's Position Between Compiled and Interpreted Languages

- **Compiled languages**, like <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">C and C++, compile code directly into machine code</mark>. However, different platforms (x86, ARM, etc.) have different instruction sets, requiring platform-specific machine code.
  
- **Interpreted languages**, like Python and Ruby, don't have this problem as the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">interpreter directly loads and runs the source code</mark>, but they suffer from lower execution efficiency.
  
- **Java** strikes a balance by compiling code into "bytecode", an <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">abstract CPU instruction</mark>. Different platform-specific JVMs load and execute the bytecode, achieving "write once, run anywhere". This is true for Java developers, but each platform's JVM is separately developed. To ensure that JVMs developed by different companies on different platforms can execute Java bytecode correctly, Sun Microsystems established a series of JVM specifications. Practically, JVMs are highly compatible; lower version Java bytecode can run on higher version JVMs.

#### Java's Different Editions

Sun Microsystems later divided Java into three versions:

- **Java SE**: Standard Edition
- **Java EE**: Enterprise Edition
- **Java ME**: Micro Edition

The relationship between these is as follows:

![[Java relationship.png]]
- **Java SE** is the standard version, including the standard JVM and libraries.
- **Java EE** is the enterprise version, extending Java SE with APIs and libraries for web applications, databases, messaging services, etc., using the same JVM as Java SE.
- **Java ME** is a stripped-down version for embedded devices, with a different set of libraries and a slimmed-down JVM.

Java SE is the core of the entire Java platform, and <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Java EE is essential for further learning in web applications</mark>. Frameworks like Spring are part of Java EE's open-source ecosystem. Unfortunately, Java ME never became popular, while Android development emerged as a standard for mobile platforms. Therefore, Java ME is not recommended unless there is a specific need.

#### Recommended Java Learning Path

1. Start with **Java SE**: Master the Java language, core development techniques, and standard library usage.
2. If proceeding to **Java EE**, focus on the <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Spring framework, database development, and distributed architecture</mark>.
3. For big data development, learn platforms like <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Hadoop, Spark, and Flink</mark>, which are based on Java or Scala.
4. For mobile development, delve into the Android platform and master Android App development.

Regardless of the path chosen, the core technologies of Java SE are foundational.

#### Java Versions

From the release of version 1.0 in 1995 to the latest Java 21, Java has evolved significantly:

| Year | Version   |
|------|-----------|
| 1995 | 1.0       |
| ...  | ...       |
| 2023 | 21        |

#### Terminology: JDK and JRE

- **JDK**: Java Development Kit
- **JRE**: Java Runtime Environment

JRE is the virtual machine that runs Java bytecode. JDK includes JRE along with a compiler, debugger, and other development tools.

### Java Terminology Explained

For beginners learning Java, terms like JDK and JRE are frequently encountered. But what exactly are they?

#### JDK: Java Development Kit
- The **JDK** is essential for Java development. It includes not just the JRE, but also <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">a compiler, debugger, and other development tools</mark>.

#### JRE: Java Runtime Environment
- The **JRE** is a <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">virtual machine that runs Java bytecode</mark>. If you only have Java source code, you need the JDK to compile it into Java bytecode.

The relationship between the two is illustrated as follows:

```ascii
  ┌─    ┌──────────────────────────────────┐
  │     │     Compiler, debugger, etc.     │
  │     └──────────────────────────────────┘
 JDK ┌─ ┌──────────────────────────────────┐
  │  │  │                                  │
  │ JRE │      JVM + Runtime Library       │
  │  │  │                                  │
  └─ └─ └──────────────────────────────────┘
        ┌───────┐┌───────┐┌───────┐┌───────┐
        │Windows││ Linux ││ macOS ││others │
        └───────┘└───────┘└───────┘└───────┘
```

#### JSR and JCP

- **JSR (Java Specification Request)** and **JCP (Java Community Process)** are crucial for maintaining the standardization of Java.

  - **JSR** is a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">set of specifications</mark> that range from the JVM's memory model to web application interfaces. Before adding a feature to the Java platform, such as database access, a JSR specification is created to define interfaces. This ensures that Java drivers written by different database vendors adhere to the same standards, allowing developers to write database code that runs across various databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL.

  - **JCP** is the <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">organization responsible for reviewing JSR proposals</mark>.

When a JSR is published, it often comes with a **Reference Implementation (RI)** and a **Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK)**:
  - The **RI** is a working code example that doesn't necessarily focus on speed but serves as a reference.
  - The **TCK** ensures that different implementations of a feature, like a Java-based messaging server, remain consistent in interface and functionality.

Typically, the RI is not used for production; developers tend to choose competitive commercial or open-source products.
