When using Maven, the `mvn` command is commonly used. However, there's also `mvnw`, which stands for Maven Wrapper. Maven Wrapper ensures that a specific project uses a designated version of Maven, regardless of the Maven version installed globally on the system. This setup is particularly useful for projects that require a specific version of Maven, as it allows them to operate independently of the global Maven installation.

#### Installing Maven Wrapper
The simplest way to install Maven Wrapper is by running the following command in the project's root directory (where the `pom.xml` file is located):

```bash
mvn -N io.takari:maven:0.7.6:wrapper
```

This command will set up the Maven Wrapper using the latest version of Maven. The version `0.7.6` is the version of the Maven Wrapper itself. To specify a particular Maven version for the project, the installation command can be adjusted accordingly, for example, to use Maven `3.3.3`.

After installation, the project directory will include `mvnw`, `mvnw.cmd`, and a `.mvn` directory. These files and directories enable the use of Maven Wrapper, allowing commands like `./mvnw clean package` to be executed, ensuring that the specific Maven version is used for the project.

#### Advantages of Maven Wrapper
One key benefit of Maven Wrapper is that it allows all developers working on a project to use a consistent version of Maven, as the `mvnw`, `mvnw.cmd`, and `.mvn` directory can be committed to the version control system, ensuring uniformity across development environments.
