In software development, breaking down a large project into multiple modules is an effective strategy to reduce complexity. 
```ascii
                        ┌ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ┐
                          ┌─────────┐
                        │ │Module A │ │
                          └─────────┘
┌──────────────┐ split  │ ┌─────────┐ │
│Single Project│───────▶  │Module B │
└──────────────┘        │ └─────────┘ │
                          ┌─────────┐
                        │ │Module C │ │
                          └─────────┘
```


For Maven projects, this means transitioning from a single-project structure to a multi-module one, where each module is treated as an independent Maven project with its own `pom.xml`.
```ascii
mutiple-project
├── module-a
│   ├── pom.xml
│   └── src
├── module-b
│   ├── pom.xml
│   └── src
└── module-c
    ├── pom.xml
    └── src
```

For example, the `pom.xml` for `module-a` would define its specific configuration, dependencies, and packaging details. If `module-a` and `module-b` have similar configurations, a parent `pom.xml` can be used to centralize common configurations and reduce duplication across modules.

```ascii
multiple-project
├── pom.xml
├── parent
│   └── pom.xml
├── module-a
│   ├── pom.xml
│   └── src
├── module-b
│   ├── pom.xml
│   └── src
└── module-c
    ├── pom.xml
    └── src
```

The parent `pom.xml` typically has a packaging type of `pom` and includes common configurations and dependencies used by all child modules. Each module’s `pom.xml` can then inherit from this parent, simplifying the overall project structure.

Dependencies between modules are managed by including them in the respective `pom.xml` files of the dependent modules. For example, if `module-a` depends on `module-b`, it will include `module-b` as a dependency in its `pom.xml`.

Finally, a root `pom.xml` is used at the top level of the project to orchestrate the build process for all modules, defining them in a `<modules>` section. This setup allows Maven to compile all modules in the correct order, considering their interdependencies.

In the context of Maven repositories, the usage of central, private, and local repositories is mentioned. The central repository is where most third-party modules are obtained. Private repositories are used within organizations to host internal or private modules, and local repositories are used for developing and referencing locally built projects. However, installing modules directly to the local Maven repository is not recommended due to potential issues with version inconsistencies. Instead, modular compilation is advised, where Maven handles the compilation of interdependent modules together, ensuring consistency and order.
