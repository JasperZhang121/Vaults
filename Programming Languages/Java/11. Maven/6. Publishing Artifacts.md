When using third-party open-source libraries like `commons-logging`, Maven automatically downloads their JARs and resolves dependencies based on the `pom.xml`. But what if you've developed your own amazing open-source library that you want others to use? Rather than sharing a direct JAR download link, it's more professional to distribute it through Maven's repository system.

#### Publishing to Maven's Repository
To publish your library to Maven's repository, there are several methods. Here's an overview of the process:

```ascii
how-to-become-rich
├── maven-repo        
├── pom.xml           
├── src
│   ├── main
│   │   ├── java      
│   │   └── resources 
│   └── test
│       ├── java      
│       └── resources 
└── target            
```

1. **Static File Hosting:**
   - Your project, like `how-to-become-rich`, should be organized with a Maven project directory structure.
   - You can host the Maven repository locally within your project structure, then use a tool like GitHub Pages to serve it as a static website.
   - This method involves updating the `pom.xml` to manage distribution and potentially include sources and documentation.

2. **Using Nexus for Central Repository:**
   - To appear more professional, you might want to publish directly to Maven's Central Repository.
   - This usually involves using a service like Nexus provided by Sonatype, where you can host your artifacts before they are synced to the Central Repository.
   - The process includes account creation, GPG signing, and configuration in your Maven `settings.xml` and project `pom.xml`.

3. **Publishing to a Private Repository:**
   - If you prefer not to share your artifacts publicly, you can publish them to a private repository, such as a self-hosted Nexus server or GitHub Packages.
   - Using GitHub Packages requires authenticated access, making it suitable for private repositories.
   - You’ll need to manage access tokens for both publishing and consuming the artifacts, and configure Maven settings accordingly.

#### Key Considerations

- When publishing, especially to public repositories, it's crucial not to change artifacts post-publication. Instead, publish a new version for any update.
- For private hosting, like GitHub Packages, detailed access control via tokens is necessary for both publishing and consuming the artifacts.
