Before diving into Maven, let's explore what a Java project requires. First, we need to determine which dependencies to include. For example, if we need `commons logging`, we must add the `commons logging` JAR file to the classpath. If we also need `log4j`, we should add the relevant `log4j` JAR files to the classpath. This is part of dependency management.

Next, we should define the project's directory structure. For instance, the `src` directory contains Java source code, the `resources` directory holds configuration files, and the `bin` directory contains the compiled `.class` files.

Additionally, we need to configure the environment, like the JDK version, the compilation and packaging process, and the current code version.

Lastly, beyond using an IDE for compilation, we must be able to compile via command line tools to enable building, testing, and deploying on a standalone server.

These tasks are not particularly challenging but can be tedious and time-consuming. If each project had its own configuration setup, it would be chaotic. What we need is a standardized Java project management and build tool.

### Maven

Maven is a build and management tool specifically designed for Java projects. Its main features include:

- Providing a standardized project structure.
- Offering a standardized build process (compilation, testing, packaging, publishing, etc.).
- Implementing a dependency management mechanism.

#### Maven Project Structure

The default directory structure of a Maven-managed Java project looks like this:

```
a-maven-project
├── pom.xml
├── src
│   ├── main
│   │   ├── java
│   │   └── resources
│   └── test
│       ├── java
│       └── resources
└── target
```

- `a-maven-project` is the root directory named after the project.
- `pom.xml` is the project descriptor file.
- Java source code is in `src/main/java`.
- Resource files are in `src/main/resources`.
- Test source code is in `src/test/java`.
- Test resources are in `src/test/resources`.
- Compiled and packaged files are in the `target` directory.

All these directories follow a standard structure that should not be modified arbitrarily. Using the standard structure allows Maven to function correctly without additional configurations.

The `pom.xml` file, a crucial project descriptor, typically looks like this:

```xml
<project ...>
    <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
    <groupId>com.jasperzhang121.learnjava</groupId>
    <artifactId>hello</artifactId>
    <version>1.0</version>
    <packaging>jar</packaging>
    <properties>
        ...
    </properties>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>commons-logging</groupId>
            <artifactId>commons-logging</artifactId>
            <version>1.2</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</project>
```

In Maven:
- `groupId` is like Java's package name, usually representing the company or organization.
- `artifactId` is like Java's class name, usually representing the project name.
- Together with `version`, these elements uniquely identify a Maven project.

Declaring a dependency in Maven, as shown above, automatically downloads and adds it to the classpath.

### Installing Maven

To install Maven:
1. Download the latest Maven 3.9.x from the official Maven website.
2. Unzip locally and set environment variables:
   - `M2_HOME=/path/to/maven-3.9.x`
   - `PATH=$PATH:$M2_HOME/bin`
   - For Windows, add `%M2_HOME%\bin` to the system Path variable.

Then, in the command prompt, running `mvn -version` should display Maven's version information. If the command is not found, check and fix the system PATH.
