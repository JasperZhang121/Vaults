In our previous discussion, we covered Maven's lifecycle, phases, and goals: building a project with Maven means executing a lifecycle up to a specified phase. Each phase executes one or more default goals, which are the smallest unit of work.

Taking the `compile` phase as an example, executing `mvn compile` will trigger Maven to run this phase, which calls the compiler plugin to execute its `compiler:compile` goal.

In reality, executing each phase is done through a plugin in Maven. Maven itself doesn’t know how to compile; it merely locates the appropriate compiler plugin and executes its `compiler:compile` goal to complete the compilation.

Thus, using Maven effectively means configuring the necessary plugins and then invoking them through phases.

Maven has several built-in standard plugins for common phases:
- **clean** phase uses the clean plugin
- **compile** phase uses the compiler plugin
- **test** phase uses the surefire plugin
- **package** phase uses the jar plugin

For needs beyond the standard plugins, custom plugins can be utilized. For example, to create an executable JAR, the `maven-shade-plugin` can be used, which is declared in the `pom.xml` like this:

```xml
<project>
    ...
    <build>
        <plugins>
            <plugin>
                <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                <artifactId>maven-shade-plugin</artifactId>
                <version>3.2.1</version>
                <executions>
                    <execution>
                        <phase>package</phase>
                        <goals>
                            <goal>shade</goal>
                        </goals>
                        ...
                    </execution>
                </executions>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
    </build>
</project>
```

Custom plugins often require specific configurations. For instance, `maven-shade-plugin` needs to specify the entry point of the Java program:

```xml
<configuration>
    <transformers>
        <transformer implementation="org.apache.maven.plugins.shade.resource.ManifestResourceTransformer">
            <mainClass>com.jasperzhang.learnjava.Main</mainClass>
        </transformer>
    </transformers>
</configuration>
```

Standard plugins like the compiler come pre-configured in Maven and don’t need explicit declaration, but other plugins do.

Some commonly used plugins include:

- `maven-shade-plugin`: packages all dependencies into an executable JAR.
- `cobertura-maven-plugin`: generates unit test coverage reports.
- `findbugs-maven-plugin`: performs static analysis on Java source code to identify potential problems.
