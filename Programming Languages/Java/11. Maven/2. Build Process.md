Maven not only has a standardized project structure but also a standardized build process that automates compilation, packaging, release, etc.

### Lifecycle and Phase
With Maven, understanding its lifecycle is crucial. Maven's lifecycle consists of a series of phases, with the built-in default lifecycle including phases like:

- validate
- initialize
- generate-sources
- compile
- test
- package
- install
- deploy

For example, running `mvn package` executes the default lifecycle up to the package phase, and `mvn compile` only runs up to the compile phase.

The clean lifecycle, another commonly used one, includes:

- pre-clean
- clean (this is a phase, not a lifecycle)
- post-clean

The command after `mvn` is the phase, and Maven runs up to the specified phase automatically.

### Complex Example
For instance, executing `mvn clean package` runs the clean lifecycle up to the clean phase, then the default lifecycle up to the package phase.

Commonly used commands in development include:

- `mvn clean`: Removes all generated classes and JARs.
- `mvn clean compile`: Cleans and then compiles.
- `mvn clean test`: Cleans and then tests.
- `mvn clean package`: Cleans and then packages.

Most phases do nothing by default because thereâ€™s often no configuration set in the `pom.xml` for these phases.

### Common Phases
The frequently used phases are:

- clean: Cleaning
- compile: Compiling
- test: Testing
- package: Packaging

### Goal
Executing a phase triggers one or more goals, for example:

- compile phase triggers `compiler:compile` goal
- test phase triggers `compiler:testCompile` and `surefire:test` goals

Goals are named in the format `abc:xyz`.

### Analogy
To understand better:

- A lifecycle is like a Java package, containing one or more phases.
- A phase is like a Java class, containing one or more goals.
- A goal is like a method in a class, the actual worker.

In most cases, specifying the phase automatically executes the associated goals, though in some cases, a specific goal can be executed directly, like `mvn tomcat:run` to start the Tomcat server.
