If our project depends on third-party JARs like commons logging, where do we download the JAR for commons logging?

And if we want to use log4j, what JARs are needed for log4j?

Similar dependencies include JUnit, JavaMail, MySQL driver, etc. A feasible method is to search for the official website of the project via search engines, manually download the zip file, unzip it, and put it into the classpath. However, this process is very cumbersome.

Maven has solved the dependency management problem. For example, our project depends on the JAR `abc`, and `abc` depends on `xyz`:

```
┌──────────────┐
│Sample Project│
└──────────────┘
        │
        ▼
┌──────────────┐
│     abc      │
└──────────────┘
        │
        ▼
┌──────────────┐
│     xyz      │
└──────────────┘
```

When we declare the dependency on `abc`, Maven automatically adds both `abc` and `xyz` to our project's dependencies, eliminating the need for us to investigate whether `abc` depends on `xyz`.

Thus, the first role of Maven is to resolve dependency management. We declare that our project needs `abc`, and Maven automatically imports the `abc` JAR, then determines `abc` needs `xyz`, and imports the `xyz` JAR. Consequently, our project will depend on both `abc` and `xyz` JARs.

Let's look at a complex dependency example:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
    <version>1.4.2.RELEASE</version>
</dependency>
```

When we declare a dependency on `spring-boot-starter-web`, Maven automatically resolves and determines that ultimately around twenty to thirty other dependencies are needed:

- `spring-boot-starter-web`
  - `spring-boot-starter`
    - `spring-boot`
    - `spring-boot-autoconfigure`
    - `spring-boot-starter-logging`
      - `logback-classic`
        - `logback-core`
        - `slf4j-api`
      - `jcl-over-slf4j`
        - `slf4j-api`
      - `jul-to-slf4j`
        - `slf4j-api`
      - `log4j-over-slf4j`
        - `slf4j-api`
    - `spring-core`
    - `snakeyaml`
  - `spring-boot-starter-tomcat`
    - `tomcat-embed-core`
    - `tomcat-embed-el`
    - `tomcat-embed-websocket`
      - `tomcat-embed-core`
  - `jackson-databind`
  - ...

Manually managing these dependencies is very time-consuming and prone to errors.

#### Dependency Types
Maven defines several types of dependencies: compile, test, runtime, and provided:

- **compile**: Required at compile time (default), e.g., `commons-logging`
- **test**: Required at test compile time, e.g., `junit`
- **runtime**: Not needed at compile time, but required at runtime, e.g., MySQL driver
- **provided**: Required at compile time, but provided by JDK or a server at runtime, e.g., `servlet-api`

For example, a common test dependency is JUnit:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.junit.jupiter</groupId>
    <artifactId>junit-jupiter-api</artifactId>
    <version>5.3.2</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

The last question is, how does Maven know where to download the required dependencies or JARs? Maven maintains a central repository (repo1.maven.org), where all third-party libraries upload their JARs and related information, allowing Maven to download the required dependencies to the local machine.

Maven does not always download JARs from the central repository. Once a JAR is downloaded, it is cached locally in the `.m2` directory of the user's home directory, so subsequent builds do not require re-downloading the same JAR, except for the first time which might be slow due to the download process.

#### Unique Identifier
Maven uniquely identifies a JAR with three variables:

- **groupId**: Organization's name, similar to Java's package name.
- **artifactId**: JAR's name, similar to Java's class name.
- **version**: Version of the JAR.

With these three variables

Maven can uniquely identify and ensure the integrity of each JAR file. A JAR once downloaded by Maven can be safely cached locally for future use. It's important to note that versions ending in `-SNAPSHOT` are considered development versions by Maven and are re-downloaded for each build, intended for private use in internal Maven repositories, not for public release.

Maven Mirror
Maven mirrors can speed up dependency downloads, especially if the central Maven repository is slow to access. Users, particularly in China, often use Alibaba Cloud's Maven mirror. Configuring a Maven mirror involves creating a `settings.xml` file in the `.m2` directory with specific mirror settings.

Searching for Third-party Components
To find the exact `groupId`, `artifactId`, and `version` for a third-party component like `okhttp`, one can use search.maven.org. This service allows for easy lookup and integration of Maven dependencies.

Command-line Compilation
Maven projects are typically built using the command `mvn clean package`, which compiles the source code and packages it into a JAR file located in the `target` directory, facilitating the automation of build and dependency management processes.
