Generics is a technology similar to "template code", and different languages might implement generics differently. Java uses a method known as type erasure for its implementation of generics.<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Type erasure means that the virtual machine (JVM) knows nothing about generics. All the work related to generics is done by the compiler</mark>.

For example, when we write a generic class `Pair<T>`, this is what the compiler sees:

```java
public class Pair<T> {
    private T first;
    private T last;
    public Pair(T first, T last) {
        this.first = first;
        this.last = last;
    }
    public T getFirst() {
        return first;
    }
    public T getLast() {
        return last;
    }
}
```

However, the virtual machine (JVM) does not know about generics. This is what the JVM executes:

```java
public class Pair {
    private Object first;
    private Object last;
    public Pair(Object first, Object last) {
        this.first = first;
        this.last = last;
    }
    public Object getFirst() {
        return first;
    }
    public Object getLast() {
        return last;
    }
}
```

Therefore, Java's implementation of generics through type erasure results in:

- The compiler treats type `<T>` as `Object`;
- The compiler implements safe type casting based on `<T>`.

When we use generics, the code we write is what the compiler sees:

```java
Pair<String> p = new Pair<>("Hello", "world");
String first = p.getFirst();
String last = p.getLast();
```

But the JVM executes the code without generics:

```java
Pair p = new Pair("Hello", "world");
String first = (String) p.getFirst();
String last = (String) p.getLast();
```

So, Java's generics are enforced by the compiler at compile-time. Internally, the compiler always treats all types `T` as `Object`, but when casting is required, the compiler will automatically perform safe type casting based on `T`'s type.

Understanding Java's implementation of generics through type erasure, we realize the limitations of Java's generics:

Limitation 1: `<T>` cannot be a primitive type, e.g., `int`, because the actual type is `Object`, and `Object` cannot hold a primitive type:

```java
Pair<int> p = new Pair<>(1, 2); // compile error!
```

Limitation 2: It is impossible to obtain a generic Class with its type. Observing the following code:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Pair<String> p1 = new Pair<>("Hello", "world");
        Pair<Integer> p2 = new Pair<>(123, 456);
        Class c1 = p1.getClass();
        Class c2 = p2.getClass();
        System.out.println(c1 == c2); // true
        System.out.println(c1 == Pair.class); // true
    }
}
```

Since `T` is `Object`, getting the Class of `Pair<String>` and `Pair<Integer>` gives us the same Class, the Class of the `Pair` class.

In other words, all generic instances, no matter what type `T` is, `getClass()` returns the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">same Class instance because after compilation</mark>, they all become `Pair<Object>`.

Limitation 3: It's impossible to check for generic types:

```java
Pair<Integer> p = new Pair<>(123, 456);
// Compile error:
if (p instanceof Pair<String>) {
}
```

The reason is the same as before: there is no `Pair<String>.class`, only `Pair.class`.

Limitation 4: Cannot instantiate type `T`:

```java
public class Pair<T> {
    private T first;
    private T last;
    public Pair() {
        // Compile error:
        first = new T();
        last = new T();
    }
}
```

The above code cannot compile because the constructor's lines:

```java
first = new T();
last = new T();
```

After erasure, essentially become:

```java
first = new Object();
last = new Object();
```

This way, creating `new Pair<String>()` and `new Pair<Integer>()` would both end up as `Object`, which the compiler prevents as the types are incorrect.

To instantiate `T` type, we must use an additional `Class<T>` parameter:

```java
public class Pair<T> {
    private T first;
    private T last;
    public Pair(Class<T> clazz) {
        first = clazz.newInstance();
        last = clazz.newInstance();
    }
}
```

The above code uses the `Class<T>` parameter and reflection to instantiate `T` type. When using it, `Class<T
