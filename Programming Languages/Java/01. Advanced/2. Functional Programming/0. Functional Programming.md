### Introduction

Let's first understand what a function is. A function is a fundamental unit of operation. A large program is essentially a top-level function calling several lower-level functions. These called functions may call other functions, meaning that <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">a large task is broken down into smaller tasks, layer by layer, and executed</mark>. So, in procedural programming, functions are the basic units of design.

Java does not support defining standalone functions, but <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">static methods can be considered as independent functions</mark>, while instance methods can be thought of as functions with an implicit `this` parameter.

**Functional Programming**, as the name suggests, introduces a new concept where programming is closer to mathematical computation, even though it can also be classified under procedural programming.

To better understand, let's distinguish between the terms **computer** and **computation**.

- **Computer**: At the hardware level, the CPU executes instructions like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, along with conditional checks and jumps. Therefore, assembly language is the closest to a computer's hardware.
- **Computation**: Refers to mathematical operations, and the more abstract the computation, the further away it is from the computer hardware.

In terms of programming languages:
- **Low-level languages** are closer to the hardware, with lower abstraction and higher execution efficiency (e.g., C language).
- **High-level languages** are closer to abstract computation, with higher abstraction but lower execution efficiency (e.g., Lisp language).

Functional programming is a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">programming paradigm with a very high level of abstraction</mark>. In a purely functional programming language, functions do not have variables. Therefore, a <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">function always produces the same output for a given input</mark>. Such functions are known as **pure functions** because they have no side effects. On the other hand, in languages that allow the use of variables, the internal state of a function might vary, leading to different outputs for the same input. These functions are said to have **side effects**.

One notable feature of functional programming is that <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">functions can be passed as parameters to other functions</mark>, and functions can also be returned as results!

The origins of functional programming trace back to mathematician Alonzo Church, who developed a system of function transformation logic known as **Lambda Calculus (Î»-Calculus)**. For this reason, functional programming is often referred to as **Lambda Calculus**.

Starting from Java 8, the Java platform began to support functional programming.
