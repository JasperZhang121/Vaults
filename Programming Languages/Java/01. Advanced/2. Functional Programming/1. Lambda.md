### Review Java Methods

#### Instance Methods

For example, the `equals()` method in the `Integer` class:

```java
public final class Integer {
    boolean equals(Object o) {
        ...
    }
}
```

#### Static Methods

For example, the `parseInt()` method in the `Integer` class:

```java
public final class Integer {
    public static int parseInt(String s) {
        ...
    }
}
```

Whether it is an instance method or a static method, both are essentially equivalent to functions in procedural languages like C. For instance, the C function:

```c
char* strcpy(char* dest, char* src)
```

In Java, an instance method implicitly receives a `this` variable, meaning an instance method always has an implicit `this` parameter.

#### Functional Programming and Lambda Calculus

Functional programming (FP) treats functions as fundamental operational units. Functions can be used as variables, passed as arguments, and returned as results. The theory behind functional programming is based on **Lambda Calculus**, which is why the coding style that supports functional programming is often referred to as **Lambda Expressions**.

### Lambda Expressions in Java

In Java, we often encounter **single-method interfaces**, which are interfaces that define only one method. Some common examples include:

- `Comparator`
- `Runnable`
- `Callable`

Take `Comparator` as an example. When we want to use `Arrays.sort()`, we can pass in a `Comparator` instance, as shown below using an anonymous class:

```java
String[] array = ...;
Arrays.sort(array, new Comparator<String>() {
    public int compare(String s1, String s2) {
        return s1.compareTo(s2);
    }
});
```

This approach is quite verbose. Starting from Java 8, we can use **Lambda Expressions** to simplify the code. The above example can be rewritten as:

```java
// Lambda
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String[] array = new String[] { "Apple", "Orange", "Banana", "Lemon" };
        Arrays.sort(array, (s1, s2) -> {
            return s1.compareTo(s2);
        });
        System.out.println(String.join(", ", array));
    }
}
```

Notice how the Lambda expression is writtenâ€”it simply defines the method:

```java
(s1, s2) -> {
    return s1.compareTo(s2);
}
```

Here, the parameters are `(s1, s2)`, and their types are omitted because the compiler can infer that they are of type `String`. The arrow `->` separates the parameters from the method body, and all logic is written inside the body. Lambda expressions do not require a class definition, making them very concise.

If the body contains only one line, like `return xxx;`, you can further simplify it as:

```java
Arrays.sort(array, (s1, s2) -> s1.compareTo(s2));
```

The return type is also inferred by the compiler. In this case, it infers that the return type is `int`, and as long as an `int` is returned, the compiler will not throw an error.

### FunctionalInterface Annotation

A **Functional Interface** is an interface that defines only one method. It can be marked with the `@FunctionalInterface` annotation. For example, the `Callable` interface:

```java
@FunctionalInterface
public interface Callable<V> {
    V call() throws Exception;
}
```

Another example is the `Comparator` interface:

```java
@FunctionalInterface
public interface Comparator<T> {

    int compare(T o1, T o2);

    boolean equals(Object obj);

    default Comparator<T> reversed() {
        return Collections.reverseOrder(this);
    }

    default Comparator<T> thenComparing(Comparator<? super T> other) {
        ...
    }
    ...
}
```

Although the `Comparator` interface contains many methods, it only has one **abstract** method: `int compare(T o1, T o2)`. The other methods are either **default** or **static** methods. It's also important to note that `boolean equals(Object obj)` is defined in the `Object` class and does not count as an interface method. Therefore, `Comparator` is still considered a `FunctionalInterface`.
