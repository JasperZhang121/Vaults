### public
- Classes and interfaces <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">defined as public can be accessed by any other class</mark>.
```java
package abc;

public class Hello {
    public void hi() {
    }
}
```
The class `Hello` above is public, so it can be accessed by classes from other packages as well.
```java
package xyz;

class Main {
    void foo() {
        // Main can access Hello
        Hello h = new Hello();
    }
}
```
Fields and methods declared as public can also be accessed by other classes, provided they have access to the class itself.
```java
package abc;

public class Hello {
    public void hi() {
    }
}
```
The `hi()` method above is public and can be called by other classes, given that they can access the `Hello` class.
```java
package xyz;

class Main {
    void foo() {
        Hello h = new Hello();
        h.hi();
    }
}
```

### private
- Fields and methods <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">declared as private cannot be accessed by other classes</mark>.
```java
package abc;

public class Hello {
    // Cannot be called by other classes:
    private void hi() {
    }

    public void hello() {
        this.hi();
    }
}
```
Private access is limited to the class itself and is not dependent on the order of method declarations. It is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">recommended to place private methods towards the end of the class to prioritize the visibility of public methods</mark>.

### protected
- Protected access applies to inheritance relationships. Fields and methods <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">declared as protected can be accessed by subclasses and their subclasses</mark>.
```java
package abc;

public class Hello {
    // Protected method:
    protected void hi() {
    }
}
```
The protected method above can be accessed by inheriting classes.
```java
package xyz;

class Main extends Hello {
    void foo() {
        // Can access the protected method:
        hi();
    }
}
```

### package
- Package scope allows access to classes, fields, and methods within the same package without the need for public, protected, or private modifiers.
```java
package abc;

class Hello {
    // Package-scoped method:
    void hi() {
    }
}
```
As long as classes are in the same package, they can access package-scoped classes, fields, and methods.
```java
package abc;

class Main {
    void foo() {
        // Can access package-scoped class:
        Hello h = new Hello();
        // Can call package-scoped method:
        h.hi();
    }
}
```

### Local Variables
- Variables defined inside a method are called local variables, and their scope is limited to the method block.
```java
package abc;

public class Hello {
    void hi(String name) { // ①
        String s = name.toLowerCase(); // ②
        int len = s.length(); // ③
        if (len < 10) { // ④
            int p = 10 - len; // ⑤
            for (int i=0; i<10; i++) { // ⑥
                System.out.println(); // ⑦
            } // ⑧
        } // ⑨
    } // ⑩
}
```
- The method parameter name is a local variable, and its scope is the entire method, that is, ①~⑩;
- The scope of variable s is from the place of definition to the end of the method, that is, ②~⑩;
- The scope of variable len is from the place of definition to the end of the method, that is, ③~⑩;
- The scope of variable p is from the definition point to the end of the if block, that is, ⑤~⑨;
- The scope of variable i is the for loop, that is, ⑥～⑧.

### final
- The `final` modifier is used to prevent classes from being inherited, methods from being overridden, fields from being reassigned, or local variables from being re-assigned.

### Best Practices:
- If you're not sure whether to use public, consider <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">using more restrictive access modifiers to limit exposure of fields and methods</mark>.
- Defining methods with package scope can be helpful for testing, as test classes can access package-scoped methods if they are in the same package.
- A `.java` file can <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">only contain one public class</mark>, but it <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">can include multiple non-public classes</mark>.
