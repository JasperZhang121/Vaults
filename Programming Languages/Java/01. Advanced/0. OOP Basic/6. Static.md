Instance fields (also known as instance variables) are fields defined in a class for which each instantiated object of the class has its own separate copy. These fields are unique to each instance of the class.

#### Example
```java
class Person {
    public String name; // Instance field
    public int age;     // Instance field
}
```
Each `Person` object will have its own `name` and `age` fields.

### Static Fields

Static fields (also known as class variables) are defined with the `static` keyword. Unlike instance fields, static fields are shared across all instances of the class. <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">There is only one copy of a static field per class, regardless of how many times the class has been instantiated</mark>.

#### Example
```java
class Person {
    public static int number; // Static field
}
```
All instances of `Person` share the same `number` field.

### Accessing Static Fields
It is recommended to access static fields with the class name rather than via instances. For example:
```java
Person.number = 99;
System.out.println(Person.number);
```

### Static Methods

Static methods are methods that <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">belong to the class rather than any specific instance</mark>. They can be called without creating an instance of the class.

#### Example
```java
class Person {
    public static void setNumber(int value) {
        number = value; // Accesses the static field
    }
}
```
Static methods can be called directly with the class name:
```java
Person.setNumber(99);
```

### Characteristics of Static Methods
- They can <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">only access static fields and other static methods</mark>.
- They <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cannot access instance fields or instance methods</mark> (as there is no `this` reference).
- They are often used for utility or helper functions.

### Static Fields in Interfaces
In Java, interfaces can have static fields, but these must be `final` (constants). Since fields in an interface are implicitly `public static final`, these keywords are usually omitted.

#### Example
```java
public interface Person {
    int MALE = 1;    // implicitly public static final
    int FEMALE = 2;  // implicitly public static final
}
```

### Use Cases
- **Static Methods**: Often used in utility classes like `java.util.Arrays` or `java.lang.Math`.
- **Static Fields**: Commonly used for constants or shared data across instances.
- **Instance Fields**: Used for data specific to each instance of a class.
