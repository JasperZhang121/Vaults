@JsonIgnore is an annotation provided by the Jackson library (typically from the package `com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation`) used in Java for controlling JSON serialization and deserialization. Hereâ€™s what it does:

- **Excludes Fields or Methods:** When you annotate a field or its getter method with @JsonIgnore, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Jackson will omit that property when converting your Java object to JSON</mark>. This means the annotated property will not appear in the JSON output.
    
- **Controls Deserialization:** Similarly, during JSON deserialization (when converting JSON back into a Java object), Jackson will ignore any JSON property that maps to the @JsonIgnore-annotated field or method.
    
- **Use Cases:**
    
    - **Security:** Prevent sensitive data (like passwords or personal details) from being exposed in the JSON output.
        
    - **Optimization:** Exclude properties that are not needed in the JSON representation, reducing payload size.
        
    - **Avoiding Cycles:** Help manage circular references that could otherwise cause infinite recursion during serialization.
        

**Example:**

```java
import com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonIgnore;

public class User {
    private String username;
    private String password;

    public User(String username, String password) {
        this.username = username;
        this.password = password;
    }

    public String getUsername() {
        return username;
    }

    public void setUsername(String username) {
        this.username = username;
    }

    @JsonIgnore
    public String getPassword() {
        return password;
    }

    public void setPassword(String password) {
        this.password = password;
    }
}
```

In the example above, when an instance of `User` is serialized to JSON, the `password` field will be omitted, thereby protecting sensitive information.
