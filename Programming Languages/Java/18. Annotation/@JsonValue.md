The `@JsonValue` annotation is part of the Jackson JSON processing library (typically in the `com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation` package) and is used to indicate that the annotated method or field should be used to represent the entire object during serialization

### Key Points

- **Purpose**:  
    When serializing an object to JSON, instead of outputting all of its properties, Jackson will use the value returned by the annotated method or the value of the annotated field as the JSON representation of the object.
    
- **Typical Use Cases**:
    
    - **Enums**: To serialize an enum as a specific value (e.g., a string or number) instead of its default name.
    - **Wrapper Objects**: For objects that are essentially wrappers around a single value.
    - **Custom Serialization**: When you want to simplify the JSON output by representing complex objects with a single value.
- **Restrictions**:  
    Only one method or field in a class should be annotated with `@JsonValue`. If more than one is present, Jackson will throw an exception during serialization.

### Example 1: Enum Serialization

Imagine you have an enum where you want each constant to be serialized as a specific string value:

```java
import com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonValue;

public enum Status {
    ACTIVE("active"),
    INACTIVE("inactive");

    private final String value;

    Status(String value) {
        this.value = value;
    }

    @JsonValue
    public String getValue() {
        return value;
    }
}
```

**What happens?**  
When you serialize a `Status` enum (e.g., `Status.ACTIVE`), the output JSON will be `"active"` instead of a JSON object or the default enum name.

### Example 2: Custom Object Serialization

Consider a class where you only want to expose one specific property as its JSON representation:

```java
import com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonValue;

public class User {
    private String username;
    private String email;

    public User(String username, String email) {
        this.username = username;
        this.email = email;
    }

    // Only expose the username when serializing to JSON
    @JsonValue
    public String getUsername() {
        return username;
    }

    // Getters and setters for other properties...
}
```

**What happens?**  
When an instance of `User` is serialized, the output will be a simple JSON string representing the username, rather than a JSON object with multiple properties.

### Summary

- **Annotation Location**:  
    Use `@JsonValue` on a method or a field.
    
- **Serialization Behavior**:  
    Jackson will serialize the object as the value provided by the annotated element.
    
- **Use Cases**:  
    Ideal for simplifying JSON representations for enums, wrapper classes, or any scenario where a single value sufficiently represents an object.
    

By using `@JsonValue`, you gain fine-grained control over how your objects are serialized, making your JSON output cleaner and more aligned with your application's needs.
