The **@Lazy** annotation in Spring instructs the container to delay the initialization of a bean until it is actually needed, rather than creating it during application startup. Here are the key points:

- **Lazy Initialization:**  
    By default, Spring eagerly initializes singleton beans when the application context starts. When you mark a bean with @Lazy, its creation is deferred until it is first requested.
    
- **Usage on Bean Definitions:**  
    You can annotate a bean class or a bean definition in your configuration. For example:
    
    ```java
    @Component
    @Lazy
    public class MyService {
        // Bean code here
    }
    ```
    
    In this case, `MyService` is not instantiated during startup but only when it’s first needed.
    
- **Usage on Dependency Injection Points:**  
    You can also apply @Lazy to autowired dependencies to avoid initializing a bean unless the dependent bean actually uses it:
    
    ```java
    @Component
    public class ConsumerComponent {
        @Autowired
        @Lazy
        private MyService myService;
        
        // Other code here
    }
    ```
    
- **Benefits:**
    
    - **Performance:** Reduces startup time by deferring bean instantiation until necessary.
    - **Resource Management:** Helps manage resources more efficiently by not initializing unused beans.
    - **Handling Circular Dependencies:** Can sometimes help resolve circular dependencies by delaying the creation of beans.
- **Considerations:**  
    While lazy initialization can improve startup performance, it might introduce a slight delay the first time the bean is accessed. It’s important to use it where deferring bean creation makes sense for your application context.

**@Lazy** is a useful tool in Spring for optimizing application startup and resource usage by deferring bean initialization until absolutely necessary.
