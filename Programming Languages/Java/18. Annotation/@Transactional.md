`@Transactional` is a Spring annotation used to define transaction boundaries in your application. It ensures that all database operations within the scope of the method (or class, if applied at the class level) are <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">executed within a single transaction. If any operation fails, the transaction will be rolled back to maintain data consistency</mark>.

Key points:

- **Propagation**: Defines how transactions should behave when a method is called within an existing transaction (e.g., `REQUIRED`, `REQUIRES_NEW`).
- **Isolation**: Specifies the isolation level for the transaction (e.g., `READ_COMMITTED`, `SERIALIZABLE`).
- **Rollback**: Specifies the conditions under which the transaction should be rolled back, typically on exceptions (`rollbackFor`).

For example:

```java
@Transactional
public void performTransactionalOperation() {
    // Database operations here
}
```

This ensures that all operations in `performTransactionalOperation()` are part of the same transaction and are either committed or rolled back together.
