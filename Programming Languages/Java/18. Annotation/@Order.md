The @Order annotation is a mechanism provided primarily by the Spring Framework to control the precedence or order in which components (such as beans, aspects, or filters) are processed. Here are the key points about @Order:

•	Purpose:
It defines the sorting order for components. For example, if you have multiple filters or aspects, the one with a lower order value is given higher precedence and will be executed before those with higher values.

•	How It Works:
	•	The annotation accepts an integer value.
	•	A lower number means higher priority (e.g., @Order(1) runs before @Order(2)).
	•	If no @Order is specified, the default order is typically set to a high value (like Integer.MAX_VALUE), meaning it will be processed after those with an explicitly lower order.

•	Usage Scenarios:
	•	Spring AOP (Aspects): When multiple aspects are applied, @Order determines which advice runs first.
	•	Filters and Interceptors: In web applications, you can control the execution order of servlet filters by annotating them with @Order.
	•	Configuration Classes: Sometimes used in auto-configuration to decide the order in which configuration classes are loaded.
	•	Example:

```java
import org.springframework.core.annotation.Order;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;
import javax.servlet.*;
import java.io.IOException;

@Component
@Order(1)
public class FirstFilter implements Filter {
    @Override
    public void doFilter(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response, FilterChain chain)
            throws IOException, ServletException {
        // Pre-processing logic
        chain.doFilter(request, response);
        // Post-processing logic
    }
}

@Component
@Order(2)
public class SecondFilter implements Filter {
    @Override
    public void doFilter(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response, FilterChain chain)
            throws IOException, ServletException {
        // Pre-processing logic
        chain.doFilter(request, response);
        // Post-processing logic
    }
}
```

In this example, FirstFilter is executed before SecondFilter because it has a lower order value.

•	Alternative Approach:
Instead of using the @Order annotation, you could implement the Ordered interface directly in your class. The annotation is often preferred for its simplicity and declarative style.
