The `@EnumValue` annotation is not a standard Java annotation but is provided by libraries like **MyBatis-Plus** to help with the conversion between an enum and its corresponding database value.

### Key Points

- **Purpose**:  
    `@EnumValue` designates which field in an enum should be used as its value when storing to or reading from a database. This is particularly useful when you want a custom value (like an integer code or a specific string) to represent an enum instead of its name or ordinal.
    
- **Usage Scenario**:  
    In ORM frameworks such as MyBatis-Plus, when you have an entity with an enum property, the framework needs to know which part of the enum should be persisted in the database. Annotating a field within your enum with `@EnumValue` instructs MyBatis-Plus to use that field's value during persistence and retrieval.
    
- **Package**:  
    For MyBatis-Plus, the annotation is typically found in:
    
    ```java
    com.baomidou.mybatisplus.annotation.EnumValue
    ```

### Example

Consider an enum representing a status with a code and a description. You want the code to be stored in the database:

```java
import com.baomidou.mybatisplus.annotation.EnumValue;

public enum Status {
    ACTIVE(1, "Active"),
    INACTIVE(0, "Inactive");

    @EnumValue  // This field will be used for database operations.
    private final int code;
    private final String description;

    Status(int code, String description) {
        this.code = code;
        this.description = description;
    }

    public int getCode() {
        return code;
    }
    
    public String getDescription() {
        return description;
    }
}
```

**What happens?**

- When persisting an entity with a `Status` field, MyBatis-Plus will store the `code` (1 or 0) in the database.
- When reading from the database, it will use the stored value to convert back to the corresponding enum constant.

### Benefits

- **Custom Database Representation**:  
    Allows you to define a meaningful value (like an integer or a string) that represents the enum, which may be more efficient or align with your database design.
    
- **Simplified Conversion**:  
    Eliminates the need for writing custom type handlers by letting the framework automatically handle the conversion between the enum and its database value.
