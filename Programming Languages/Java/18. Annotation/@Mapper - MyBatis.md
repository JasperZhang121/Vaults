In MyBatis, the `@Mapper` annotation is used to designate an interface as a Mapper. A Mapper is essentially an interface that MyBatis uses to map SQL statements to Java methods. When you annotate an interface with `@Mapper`, MyBatis will automatically generate the implementation for the interface at runtime, making it easier to interact with the database without manually writing the implementation.

Hereâ€™s an example of how to use `@Mapper`:

### Example:

```java
import org.apache.ibatis.annotations.Mapper;
import org.apache.ibatis.annotations.Select;

@Mapper
public interface UserMapper {
  
    @Select("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = #{id}")
    User findById(int id);
}
```

In this example:

- The `@Mapper` annotation tells MyBatis to treat `UserMapper` as a Mapper.
- The `@Select` annotation is used to define a simple SQL query.

When the application runs, MyBatis will create a proxy object for the `UserMapper` interface, and the actual database operations are handled by MyBatis under the hood.

### Benefits of `@Mapper`:

1. **Automatic Mapping**: You don't need to manually implement SQL operations.
2. **Declarative Queries**: You can use annotations like `@Select`, `@Insert`, `@Update`, `@Delete`, etc., to define SQL statements.
3. **Simplified Development**: With `@Mapper`, you reduce boilerplate code.

### Usage in Spring Boot:

If you're using Spring Boot with MyBatis, make sure that your configuration class is set up correctly to scan for Mapper interfaces.

```java
@SpringBootApplication
@MapperScan("com.example.mapper")  // Scan the package where Mappers are located
public class Application {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
    }
}
```

In this case, the `@MapperScan` annotation tells Spring Boot to scan the specified package for Mapper interfaces, and the application will automatically recognize `@Mapper` annotations on interfaces.
