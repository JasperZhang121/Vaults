The `@Pattern` annotation in Java is part of the Bean Validation API (JSR 380/303) and is used to ensure that a `String` value matches a specified regular expression (regex). This annotation is typically used in Java beans to validate user input or data before it's processed further.

### Key Points

- **Package**:  
    It's found in the `javax.validation.constraints` package.
    
- **Purpose**:  
    It validates that the annotated `String` conforms to the given regular expression. This helps enforce formats such as email addresses, phone numbers, usernames, etc.
    
- **Attributes**:
    
    - **`regexp`**: The regular expression the string must match.
    - **`message`**: The error message returned if the validation fails.
    - **`flags`**: An array of `Pattern.Flag` enums to specify regex flags (like case insensitivity).

### Example

```java
import javax.validation.constraints.Pattern;

public class User {

    // The username must be alphanumeric and between 6 to 10 characters long
    @Pattern(regexp = "^[A-Za-z0-9]{6,10}$", message = "Username must be alphanumeric and between 6 to 10 characters")
    private String username;

    // Getter and Setter
    public String getUsername() {
        return username;
    }
    public void setUsername(String username) {
        this.username = username;
    }
}
```

In this example:

- The regular expression `^[A-Za-z0-9]{6,10}$` ensures that the `username` consists solely of alphanumeric characters and is between 6 and 10 characters long.
- If the validation fails (i.e., if the username doesn't match the regex), the specified message ("Username must be alphanumeric and between 6 to 10 characters") will be used in the validation error.

### Usage Context

- **Validation Frameworks**:  
    The `@Pattern` annotation is often used in combination with frameworks like Hibernate Validator, which implement the Bean Validation specification. This enables automatic validation of bean properties, often integrated with web frameworks like Spring.
    
- **Customizability**:  
    You can easily customize the regex and error messages to suit different validation needs. Additionally, by using regex flags, you can control how the pattern matching behaves (for example, making it case-insensitive).
    

Overall, `@Pattern` is a powerful and flexible way to enforce format constraints on string values in your Java applications.
