In Spring, the `@Qualifier` annotation is used to <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">resolve ambiguity when there are multiple beans of the same type</mark> in the Spring context. It allows you to specify which bean to inject when there are multiple candidates for autowiring. It's commonly used in conjunction with the `@Autowired` annotation to provide more fine-grained control over bean injection.

### How `@Qualifier` Works

When you have multiple beans of the same type, Spring won't know which one to inject, so it would fail with an exception. You can use `@Qualifier` to explicitly specify the bean you want to inject.

#### Example:

```java
@Component
public class ServiceA {
    public void doSomething() {
        System.out.println("Service A");
    }
}

@Component
public class ServiceB {
    public void doSomething() {
        System.out.println("Service B");
    }
}

@Component
public class MyController {
    
    private final ServiceA serviceA;

    @Autowired
    @Qualifier("serviceA")  // This tells Spring to inject the ServiceA bean
    public MyController(ServiceA serviceA) {
        this.serviceA = serviceA;
    }

    public void callService() {
        serviceA.doSomething();
    }
}
```

In this example, if both `ServiceA` and `ServiceB` were candidates for autowiring into `MyController`, Spring would throw an exception because it wouldn't know which one to inject. By using `@Qualifier("serviceA")`, you tell Spring explicitly which bean should be injected.

### Points to Remember

1. **`@Autowired` and `@Qualifier` Combination**: You often use `@Qualifier` together with `@Autowired` for more precise control.
2. **`@Qualifier` with `@Bean`**: If you are defining beans manually with the `@Bean` annotation, you can also use `@Qualifier` when wiring beans into other beans.

#### Example with `@Bean` and `@Qualifier`:

```java
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {

    @Bean
    @Qualifier("serviceA")
    public ServiceA serviceA() {
        return new ServiceA();
    }

    @Bean
    @Qualifier("serviceB")
    public ServiceB serviceB() {
        return new ServiceB();
    }
}

@Component
public class MyController {

    @Autowired
    @Qualifier("serviceA")
    private ServiceA serviceA;
    
    public void callService() {
        serviceA.doSomething();
    }
}
```

In this case, `@Qualifier` is used to bind a specific `@Bean` definition to the injected bean.
