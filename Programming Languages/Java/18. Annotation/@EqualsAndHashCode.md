The `@EqualsAndHashCode` annotation is part of **Lombok**, a Java library that reduces boilerplate code. This annotation automatically generates the `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods for a class, which are used to compare objects for equality and calculate hash codes, respectively.

### Key Features:

1. **Generates `equals()` and `hashCode()`**:
    
    - The `equals()` method compares objects based on their field values.
    - The `hashCode()` method generates a hash code based on the same fields used in `equals()`.
2. **Customizable**:
    
    - You can exclude specific fields from these methods.
    - You can define a superclass and include its `equals()` and `hashCode()` in the generated methods.
3. **Avoids Boilerplate Code**:
    
    - Simplifies the creation of these methods, which can otherwise be lengthy and error-prone.

### Usage:

#### Example 1: Basic Usage

```java
import lombok.EqualsAndHashCode;

@EqualsAndHashCode
public class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    // Getters and Setters (Generated by Lombok or written manually)
}
```

- **Generated equals():** Compares two `Person` objects based on `name` and `age`.
- **Generated hashCode():** Generates a hash code based on `name` and `age`.

#### Example 2: Excluding a Field

```java
@EqualsAndHashCode(exclude = {"age"})
public class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;
}
```

- The `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods will **ignore the `age` field**.

#### Example 3: Including a Superclass

```java
import lombok.EqualsAndHashCode;

@EqualsAndHashCode(callSuper = true)
public class Employee extends Person {
    private int employeeId;
}
```

- **`callSuper = true`** ensures that the `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods of the superclass (`Person`) are included in the generated methods.

### How It Works:

1. **equals():**
    
    - Checks if two objects are of the same type.
    - Compares the values of fields (or selected fields if specified) for equality.
2. **hashCode():**
    
    - Combines the hash codes of the fields into a single hash code.
    - Ensures consistency: if `equals()` returns `true`, the `hashCode()` values must be the same.

### Why Itâ€™s Important:

- **Correct Comparisons:**
    - Ensures objects are compared based on meaningful attributes, not memory addresses.
- **Collections:**
    - Required for using objects as keys in hash-based collections (e.g., `HashMap`, `HashSet`).

### Default Behavior:

Without `@EqualsAndHashCode`, you need to manually implement these methods, which is prone to errors:

```java
@Override
public boolean equals(Object o) {
    if (this == o) return true;
    if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) return false;
    Person person = (Person) o;
    return age == person.age &&
           Objects.equals(name, person.name);
}

@Override
public int hashCode() {
    return Objects.hash(name, age);
}
```
