The `@Generated` annotation is used in Java to indicate that a class, method, or field has been automatically generated by a tool or process, often for code generation purposes. This can include code generated by tools like annotation processors, ORM frameworks (e.g., Hibernate), or even during build-time processes.

Here's an example of how `@Generated` might be used:

```java
import javax.annotation.Generated;

@Generated(value = "MyCodeGenerator", date = "2024-10-27")
public class GeneratedClass {
    // Fields and methods generated by a code generation tool
}
```

### Key Points about `@Generated`:

1. **Value Attribute**: It often includes a `value` attribute, which indicates the tool or process that generated the code.
2. **Date Attribute**: Sometimes a `date` attribute is also used to specify when the code was generated.
3. **Metadata**: It serves as metadata, providing information that a particular piece of code is not manually written but generated.

### Use Cases:

- **Generated Code**: It can be used in generated Java code (e.g., JPA entities or DTOs) to mark that the class or methods were automatically created.
- **Documentation**: It helps provide documentation within the codebase, so developers understand that they should not manually modify or edit the generated code.

It's typically not used for runtime behavior but is more about providing information to developers, tools, or frameworks. It can also be used for reporting and logging purposes.
