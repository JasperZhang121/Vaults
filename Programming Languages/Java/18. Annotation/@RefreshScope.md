The `@RefreshScope` annotation is used in Spring Cloud to mark a bean so that it can be <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">dynamically refreshed at runtime</mark> when the application's configuration is updated. This is particularly useful when working with Spring Cloud Config, where configuration changes can be applied without needing to restart the entire application.

When a bean is annotated with `@RefreshScope`, Spring Cloud will automatically refresh the bean's properties whenever the configuration changes (e.g., from an external config server like Spring Cloud Config Server). This is typically used for beans that need to be reinitialized or have their properties refreshed based on changes to the configuration.

### Key Points:

- **Dynamic Configuration**: Beans with `@RefreshScope` will refresh automatically when configuration properties change.
- **External Configuration Sources**: Commonly used in conjunction with Spring Cloud Config, which allows centralized configuration management.
- **Usage**: Useful for beans that are dependent on external configuration values, such as API URLs, credentials, or feature flags.

### Example Usage:

```java
@Configuration
@RefreshScope
public class MyService {
    
    @Value("${service.api.url}")
    private String apiUrl;

    public String getApiUrl() {
        return apiUrl;
    }
}
```

In this example, the `MyService` class is marked with `@RefreshScope`. The `apiUrl` property will be dynamically refreshed whenever the value of `service.api.url` is updated in the configuration, allowing the bean to use the updated URL without requiring an application restart.

### Refreshing the Bean:

To trigger a refresh of beans annotated with `@RefreshScope`, you typically send a `POST` request to the `/actuator/refresh` endpoint if you have Spring Boot Actuator enabled.

For example:

```bash
POST http://localhost:8080/actuator/refresh
```

This will force Spring Cloud to refresh beans marked with `@RefreshScope`.
