The `@Schema` annotation is part of the **Swagger/OpenAPI** specification and is used to <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">describe the properties of a class or field in a REST API</mark>. It is commonly used in combination with **Springdoc OpenAPI** or **Springfox** to generate API documentation that is automatically accessible to consumers of your API.

### Common Use Cases for `@Schema`

- Annotating model classes to provide descriptions and metadata for API documentation.
- Annotating fields in a model to provide more details like example values, data types, or constraints.

### Example of Usage

```java
import io.swagger.v3.oas.annotations.media.Schema;

@Schema(description = "Represents a task in the task management system")
public class Task {

    @Schema(description = "Unique identifier of the task", example = "1")
    private Long id;

    @Schema(description = "The title of the task", example = "Finish homework")
    private String title;

    @Schema(description = "The due date of the task", example = "2024-10-01T10:00:00")
    private LocalDateTime dueDate;

    @Schema(description = "Whether the task is completed", example = "false")
    private Boolean isCompleted;

    // getters and setters
}
```

### Explanation

- `@Schema(description = "...")`: Provides a description of the class or field, which will appear in the generated API documentation.
- `@Schema(example = "...")`: Provides an example value that can be shown in the generated documentation.
- You can also use other attributes like `required`, `defaultValue`, `allowableValues`, etc., to further control the API documentation behavior.

This annotation helps in generating self-documenting APIs and improves the readability of API documentation for developers who use the API. It works seamlessly with tools like **Swagger UI**, which can visualize these descriptions as part of the API documentation interface.
