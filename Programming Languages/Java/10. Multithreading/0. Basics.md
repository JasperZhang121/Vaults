Modern operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) can execute multiple tasks simultaneously. Multi-tasking is the ability to run multiple tasks at the same time, such as:

The execution of code by the CPU is sequential, one instruction after another. However, even with a single-core CPU, it can run multiple tasks simultaneously because the operating system executes multiple tasks by having the CPU switch between them alternately.

For example, suppose we have homework in three subjects: Chinese, Mathematics, and English, each requiring 30 minutes. We can view these three homework assignments as three tasks and choose to do one minute of Chinese homework, then one minute of Math, and then one minute of English:

This way, by rotating through the tasks, it appears to some observers as if the homework is being done very quickly, as if three subjects are being worked on simultaneously.

Similarly, the operating system allows multiple tasks to alternate execution, such as allowing the browser to run for 0.001 seconds, QQ for 0.001 seconds, and then the music player for 0.001 seconds. To human observers, it seems like the CPU is simultaneously executing multiple tasks.

Even with multi-core CPUs, since the number of tasks usually far exceeds the number of CPU cores, tasks are still executed alternately.

### **Processes**

In computing, we refer to a task as a process. A browser is a process, a video player is another process, and likewise, a music player and Word are processes.

Some processes need to simultaneously execute multiple sub-tasks. For example, while using Word, it allows us to type, perform spell checking, and print in the background. We refer to these sub-tasks as threads.

The relationship between processes and threads is: a process can contain one or more threads, but at least one thread exists.

Operating systems schedule the smallest unit of task, which is not the process, but the thread. How threads are scheduled is entirely up to the operating system; the program itself cannot decide when to execute or for how long.

Since an application can have multiple processes and multiple threads, there are several methods to implement multitasking:

- Multi-process mode (each process only has one thread):
  
- Multi-thread mode (a process has multiple threads):
  
- Multi-process + multi-thread mode (most complex):

### **Processes vs. Threads**

Processes and threads have a containment relationship, but multitasking can be implemented by multiple processes, by multiple threads within a single process, or a mix of both.

Which method to use depends on the characteristics of processes and threads.

Compared to multi-threading, the disadvantages of multi-processing include:
- Creating a process is more costly than creating a thread, especially on Windows systems.
- Communication between processes is slower than between threads, as thread communication is merely reading and writing the same variable, which is very fast.

However, the advantages of multi-processing include:
- Multi-processing is more stable than multi-threading because, in multi-process scenarios, one process crashing will not affect other processes, whereas in multi-threading, any thread crashing will directly cause the entire process to crash.

### **Multithreading**

Java natively supports multithreading: a Java program is actually a JVM process, and the JVM process uses a main thread to execute the `main()` method. Within the `main()` method, we can start multiple threads. Additionally, the JVM has other work threads responsible for garbage collection, etc.

Thus, for most Java programs, when we talk about multitasking, we're actually discussing how to use multithreading to achieve multitasking.

Compared to single-threading, the characteristic of multithreading programming is often the need to read and write shared data and the need for synchronization. For example, during movie playback, one thread must play the video, and another thread must play the audio. The two threads need to coordinate their operations; otherwise, the video and audio will be out of sync. Therefore, multithreading programming is more complex and debugging is more challenging.

Java multithreading programming is characterized by:
- The multithreading model is the most basic concurrency model for Java programs;
- Subsequent networking, database, web development, etc., all rely on the Java multithreading model.
