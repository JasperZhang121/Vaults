When multiple threads run concurrently, their scheduling is determined by the operating system, and the program itself cannot decide. Thus, any thread can be paused by the operating system at any instruction and then resumed after a certain period.

At this point, a problem that doesn't exist in single-thread models arises: if multiple threads read and write to shared variables simultaneously, data inconsistency issues can occur.

Consider the following example:

```java
// Multithreading
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        var add = new AddThread();
        var dec = new DecThread();
        add.start();
        dec.start();
        add.join();
        dec.join();
        System.out.println(Counter.count);
    }
}

class Counter {
    public static int count = 0;
}

class AddThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        for (int i=0; i<10000; i++) { Counter.count += 1; }
    }
}

class DecThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        for (int i=0; i<10000; i++) { Counter.count -= 1; }
    }
}
```

The code is simple: two threads operate on an int variable simultaneously, one adding 10,000 times, and the other subtracting 10,000 times. The final result should be 0, but in reality, the result is different each time it runs.

This happens because reading and writing the variable must be atomic operations. An atomic operation is one or a series of operations that cannot be interrupted.

Consider the statement:

```java
n = n + 1;
```

Although it looks like one line of code, it corresponds to three instructions:

```
ILOAD
IADD
ISTORE
```

If two threads simultaneously execute `n = n + 1`, the result might not be 102, but rather 101, due to:

```
┌───────┐    ┌───────┐
│Thread1│    │Thread2│
└───┬───┘    └───┬───┘
    │            │
    │ILOAD (100) │
    │            │ILOAD (100)
    │            │IADD
    │            │ISTORE (101)
    │IADD        │
    │ISTORE (101)│
    ▼            ▼
```

To ensure correctness in a multi-thread model, synchronized operations must be used to make groups of instructions atomic. 

```ascii
┌───────┐     ┌───────┐
│Thread1│     │Thread2│
└───┬───┘     └───┬───┘
    │             │
    │-- lock --   │
    │ILOAD (100)  │
    │IADD         │
    │ISTORE (101) │
    │-- unlock -- │
    │             │-- lock --
    │             │ILOAD (101)
    │             │IADD
    │             │ISTORE (102)
    │             │-- unlock --
    ▼             ▼
```

Java programs use the `synchronized` keyword to lock an object:

```java
synchronized(lock) {
    n = n + 1;
}
```

`synchronized` ensures that at any moment, only one thread can execute the code block. Let's rewrite the above example using `synchronized`:

```java
// Multithreading
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        var add = new AddThread();
        var dec = new DecThread();
        add.start();
        dec.start();
        add.join();
        dec.join();
        System.out.println(Counter.count);
    }
}

class Counter {
    public static final Object lock = new Object();
    public static int count = 0;
}

class AddThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        for (int i=0; i<10000; i++) {
            synchronized(Counter.lock) {
                Counter.count += 1;
            }
        }
    }
}

class DecThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        for (int i=0; i<10000; i++) {
            synchronized(Counter.lock) {
                Counter.count -= 1;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Using `synchronized` solves the issue of synchronizing access to shared variables correctly. However, it has a <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">downside of reduced performance</mark> due to the inability to execute the `synchronized` code block concurrently, and locking and unlocking also consumes time, thereby reducing the program's execution efficiency.

In summary, to use `synchronized` correctly:

1. Identify the code blocks that modify shared variables.
2. Choose a shared instance as a lock.
3. Enclose the code block with `synchronized(lockObject) { ... }`.

It's crucial to understand the mechanics behind `synchronized` for ensuring the atomicity of code blocks and maintaining the correctness of program logic in a multi-threaded environment.
