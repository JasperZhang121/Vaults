Java's thread locks are reentrant locks.

What are reentrant locks? Let's look at an example:

```java
public class Counter {
    private int count = 0;

    public synchronized void add(int n) {
        if (n < 0) {
            dec(-n);
        } else {
            count += n;
        }
    }

    public synchronized void dec(int n) {
        count += n;
    }
}
```

Observe the `synchronized` modifier on the `add()` method. Once a thread enters the `add()` method, it means it has acquired the lock of the current instance (`this`). If the input `n` is less than 0, `dec()` method will be called within `add()`. Now, here's the question:

Can the same thread acquire the same lock again?

The answer is yes. The JVM allows a thread to acquire the same lock multiple times, and such a lock that can be acquired multiple times by the same thread is called a reentrant lock.

Since Java's thread locks are reentrant, when acquiring a lock, it is not only necessary to check if it's the first time getting the lock but also to record how many times the lock has been acquired. Each time a lock is acquired, the counter increments by 1, and each time a thread exits a `synchronized` block, the counter decrements by 1. The lock is truly released when the counter drops to zero.

**Deadlock**

A thread can acquire one lock and then continue to acquire another. For example:

```java
public void add(int m) {
    synchronized(lockA) { // Acquire lockA
        this.value += m;
        synchronized(lockB) { // Acquire lockB
            this.another += m;
        } // Release lockB
    } // Release lockA
}

public void dec(int m) {
    synchronized(lockB) { // Acquire lockB
        this.another -= m;
        synchronized(lockA) { // Acquire lockA
            this.value -= m;
        } // Release lockA
    } // Release lockB
}
```

When acquiring multiple locks, different threads acquiring multiple locks on different objects can lead to deadlock. For the above code, if Thread 1 and Thread 2 execute `add()` and `dec()` methods respectively:

- Thread 1: enters `add()`, acquires `lockA`.
- Thread 2: enters `dec()`, acquires `lockB`.

Subsequently:

- Thread 1: attempts to acquire `lockB`, fails, waiting;
- Thread 2: attempts to acquire `lockA`, fails, waiting.

At this point, each thread holds a different lock while attempting to acquire the lock held by the other, leading to endless waiting for both, which is a deadlock.

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Once a deadlock occurs, there is no mechanism to resolve the deadlock except forcibly terminating the JVM process.</mark>

Therefore, special attention must be paid to prevent deadlock when writing multithreaded applications, as once deadlock occurs, the process can only be terminated forcefully.

So, how can we avoid deadlocks? The answer is: threads must acquire locks in a consistent order. That is, strictly follow the order of first acquiring `lockA`, then acquiring `lockB`. Thus, `dec()` method can be rewritten as follows:

```java
public void dec(int m) {
    synchronized(lockA) { // Acquire lockA
        this.value -= m;
        synchronized(lockB) { // Acquire lockB
            this.another -= m;
        } // Release lockB
    } // Release lockA
}
```
