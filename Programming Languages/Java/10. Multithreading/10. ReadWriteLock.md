As discussed earlier, `ReentrantLock` ensures that only one thread can execute the critical section code:

```java
public class Counter {
    private final Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();
    private int[] counts = new int[10];

    public void inc(int index) {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            counts[index] += 1;
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }

    public int[] get() {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            return Arrays.copyOf(counts, counts.length);
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }
}
```

However, sometimes this protection is a bit excessive. It is noted that at any moment, only one thread is allowed to modify, meaning calling `inc()` method must acquire the lock. However, the `get()` method only reads data without modification, and it actually allows multiple threads to call simultaneously.

What we actually desire is to allow multiple threads to read simultaneously, but if one thread is writing, other threads must wait:

| Read | Write |
| ---- | ----- |
| Read | Allowed | Not Allowed |
| Write | Not Allowed | Not Allowed |

`ReadWriteLock` can solve this problem, ensuring:

- Only one thread can write (other threads neither can write nor read).
- No thread is writing, allowing multiple threads to read simultaneously (enhances performance).

Implementing this functionality with `ReadWriteLock` is quite straightforward. We need to create a `ReadWriteLock` instance, then get the read lock and write lock respectively:

```java
public class Counter {
    private final ReadWriteLock rwlock = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();
    private final Lock rlock = rwlock.readLock();
    private final Lock wlock = rwlock.writeLock();
    private int[] counts = new int[10];

    public void inc(int index) {
        wlock.lock(); // Add write lock
        try {
            counts[index] += 1;
        } finally {
            wlock.unlock(); // Release write lock
        }
    }

    public int[] get() {
        rlock.lock(); // Add read lock
        try {
            return Arrays.copyOf(counts, counts.length);
        } finally {
            rlock.unlock(); // Release read lock
        }
    }
}
```

By using read and write locks to lock reading and writing operations respectively, multiple threads can acquire the read lock simultaneously when reading, greatly improving the efficiency of concurrent reading.

`ReadWriteLock` is suitable when there's a large amount of threads reading the same data, but only a few threads modify it.

For instance, in a forum post scenario, replies can be seen as write operations, which are infrequent, while browsing can be considered as read operations, which are very frequent. This situation is suitable for using `ReadWriteLock`.
