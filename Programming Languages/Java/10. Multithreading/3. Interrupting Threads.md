If a thread is executing a long-term task, it may need to be interrupted. Interrupting a thread is sending a signal to the thread, after receiving the signal, the thread should end its execution of the `run()` method, allowing itself to terminate immediately.

**Example**: Imagine downloading a 100MB file over a slow internet connection. If the user gets impatient and clicks "cancel", the program will need to interrupt the execution of the download thread.

Interrupting a thread is straightforward: call the `interrupt()` method on the target thread from another thread. The target thread needs to repeatedly check if its status is interrupted, and if so, immediately end its execution.

Let's see an example:

```java
// Interrupting a thread
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        Thread t = new MyThread();
        t.start();
        Thread.sleep(1); // Pause for 1 millisecond
        t.interrupt(); // Interrupt the thread t
        t.join(); // Wait for t to end
        System.out.println("end");
    }
}

class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        int n = 0;
        while (!isInterrupted()) {
            n++;
            System.out.println(n + " hello!");
        }
    }
}
```

In the above code, the main thread interrupts the t thread by calling `t.interrupt()`. Note, `interrupt()` method merely sends an "interrupt request" to the t thread. Whether the t thread can immediately respond depends on the code. Since the while loop in the t thread checks `isInterrupted()`, the above code correctly responds to the interrupt request, allowing it to immediately end the execution of the `run()` method.

If a thread is in a waiting state, for example, `t.join()` causes the main thread to wait, interrupting the main thread with `interrupt()` will immediately throw an `InterruptedException`, hence if the target thread catches the `InterruptedException` thrown by the `join()` method, it indicates that another thread has called the `interrupt()` method on it. Usually, in such cases, the thread should end its execution immediately.

Another common way to interrupt a thread is to use a flag. We often use a `running` flag to indicate whether the thread should continue running. In another thread, setting `HelloThread.running` to false can end the thread:

```java
// Interrupting a thread
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        HelloThread t = new HelloThread();
        t.start();
        Thread.sleep(1);
        t.running = false; // Set the flag to false
    }
}

class HelloThread extends Thread {
    public volatile boolean running = true;
    public void run() {
        int n = 0;
        while (running) {
            n++;
            System.out.println(n + " hello!");
        }
        System.out.println("end!");
    }
}
```

The `running` flag of the `HelloThread` is a shared variable among threads and must be declared as `volatile` to ensure every thread reads the updated value.

`volatile` is used to ensure visibility of shared variables between threads. Without `volatile`, there's no guarantee that another thread will see the updated value of a variable immediately, leading to inconsistencies.
