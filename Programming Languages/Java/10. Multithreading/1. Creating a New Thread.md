Java natively supports multithreading. When a Java program starts, it actually launches a JVM process, which in turn starts the main thread to execute the `main()` method. Within the `main()` method, we can launch additional threads.

Creating a new thread is straightforward. We need to instantiate a `Thread` instance and then call its `start()` method:

```java
// Multithreading
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread t = new Thread();
        t.start(); // Launch new thread
    }
}
```

However, this thread does nothing and immediately ends upon starting. We want the new thread to execute specific code. Here are a few methods to achieve this:

**Method 1:** Derive a custom class from `Thread` and override the `run()` method:

```java
// Multithreading
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread t = new MyThread();
        t.start(); // Launch new thread
    }
}

class MyThread extends Thread {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("start new thread!");
    }
}
```

When executing the above code, notice that the `start()` method internally calls the instance's `run()` method automatically.

**Method 2:** Create a `Thread` instance by passing a `Runnable` instance:

```java
// Multithreading
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread t = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
        t.start(); // Launch new thread
    }
}

class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("start new thread!");
    }
}
```

Or, further simplify with Java 8's lambda syntax:

```java
// Multithreading
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread t = new Thread(() -> {
            System.out.println("start new thread!");
        });
        t.start(); // Launch new thread
    }
}
```

Is there a difference between printing statements executed in the thread and directly executing in the `main()` method? The difference is significant. Consider the following code:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("main start...");
        Thread t = new Thread() {
            public void run() {
                System.out.println("thread run...");
                System.out.println("thread end.");
            }
        };
        t.start();
        System.out.println("main end...");
    }
}
```

Here, `main start` will certainly print first, but where `main end` prints relative to `thread run` and `thread end` is unpredictable. Once `t` thread begins executing, both threads run concurrently, scheduled by the OS, with the program itself unable to determine the scheduling order.

To simulate concurrent execution, we can call `Thread.sleep()` in the thread, forcing the current thread to pause for a while:

```java
// Multithreading
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("main start...");
        Thread t = new Thread() {
            public void run() {
                System.out.println("thread run...");
                try {
                    Thread.sleep(10);
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
                System.out.println("thread end.");
            }
        };
        t.start();
        try {
            Thread.sleep(20);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
        System.out.println("main end...");
    }
}
```

`sleep()` takes milliseconds as its parameter. By adjusting the sleep time, we can observe the execution order of the main thread and `t` thread.

Note: Directly calling a `Thread` instance's `run()` method does not work as expected:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread t = new MyThread();
        t.run();
    }
}

class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("hello");
    }
}
```

Directly calling the `run()` method is equivalent to calling a regular Java method without changing the current thread or starting a new thread. The above code is executing the `run()` method in the `main()` thread without creating any new threads.

We must call the `Thread` instance's `start()` method to launch a new thread. If we look into the `Thread` class's source code, we'll see the `start()` method internally calls a private native `void start0()` method, where the `native` modifier indicates this method is implemented in C within the JVM, not in Java.

**Thread Priority**

You can set a thread's priority using:

```java
Thread.setPriority(int n) // 1~

10, default value is 5
```

The JVM maps the priority from 1 (low) to 10 (high) to the actual priority on the operating system (different OSes have different amounts of priorities). A higher-priority thread is scheduled with a higher priority by the OS, possibly leading to more frequent scheduling, but we cannot rely on priority settings to ensure higher-priority threads will execute first.
