From Java 5 onwards, an advanced package for handling concurrency, `java.util.concurrent`, was introduced. This package provides a vast array of advanced concurrent functionalities, significantly simplifying the writing of multithreaded programs.

We know that the Java language directly provides the `synchronized` keyword for locking, but this kind of lock is heavy, and when acquiring it, one must wait indefinitely without any additional attempt mechanism.

The `ReentrantLock` from the `java.util.concurrent.locks` package is provided as a replacement for `synchronized` locking. Let's look at traditional `synchronized` code:

```java
public class Counter {
    private int count;

    public void add(int n) {
        synchronized(this) {
            count += n;
        }
    }
}
```

If we replace it with `ReentrantLock`, we can modify the code as follows:

```java
public class Counter {
    private final Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();
    private int count;

    public void add(int n) {
        lock.lock(); // Acquire the lock
        try {
            count += n;
        } finally {
            lock.unlock(); // Ensure the lock is released
        }
    }
}
```

Because `synchronized` is provided at the Java language level as syntax, we don't need to consider exceptions, whereas `ReentrantLock` is a lock implemented with Java code. We must first acquire the lock and then ensure the lock is released correctly in the `finally` block.

As the name suggests, `ReentrantLock` is a reentrant lock, just like `synchronized`, allowing a thread to acquire the same lock multiple times.

Unlike `synchronized`, `ReentrantLock` can attempt to acquire the lock:

```java
if (lock.tryLock(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS)) {
    try {
        // Operate protected code
    } finally {
        lock.unlock(); // Ensure the lock is released
    }
}
```

The above code attempts to acquire the lock and will wait up to 1 second. If the lock is not acquired within 1 second, `tryLock()` returns false, and the program can perform some additional handling instead of waiting indefinitely.

Therefore, using `ReentrantLock` is safer than directly using `synchronized`. When a thread fails to acquire the lock with `tryLock()`, it will not lead to deadlock.

### Condition

Using `ReentrantLock` is safer than using `synchronized` directly and can replace `synchronized` for thread synchronization.

However, `synchronized` can be combined with `wait` and `notify` to implement waiting for threads when conditions are not met and waking them up when conditions are met. How do we write the functionality of `wait` and `notify` with `ReentrantLock`?

The answer is to use a `Condition` object to implement the functionality of `wait` and `notify`.

Let's still use `TaskQueue` as an example and implement the functionality previously achieved with `synchronized` through `ReentrantLock` and `Condition`:

```java
class TaskQueue {
    private final Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();
    private final Condition condition = lock.newCondition();
    private Queue<String> queue = new LinkedList<>();

    public void addTask(String s) {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            queue.add(s);
            condition.signalAll();
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }

    public String getTask() {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            while (queue.isEmpty()) {
                condition.await();
            }
            return queue.remove();
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }
}
```

As seen, when using `Condition`, the referenced `Condition` object must be returned from the `newCondition()` method of a `Lock` instance to obtain a `Condition` instance bound to the `Lock` instance.

`Condition` provides `await()`, `signal()`, and `signalAll()`, which are equivalent to `wait()`, `notify()`, and `notifyAll()` of the `synchronized` lock object in principle, and their behavior is also the same:

- `await()` will release the current lock and enter the waiting state.
- `signal()` will wake up a waiting thread.
- `signalAll()` will wake up all waiting threads.
- A woken thread returning from `await()` needs to re-acquire the lock.

Additionally, similar to `tryLock()`, `await()` can wake up by itself after waiting for a specified time if it has not been woken up by other threads through `signal()` or `signalAll()`:

```java
if (condition.await(1, TimeUnit.SECOND)) {
    // Woken up by another thread
} else {
    // Not woken up by another thread within the specified time
}
```

It is evident that using `Condition` in combination with `Lock`, we can implement more flexible thread synchronization.
