Assertion is a way to debug programs. In Java, the `assert` keyword is used for assertions.

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    double x = Math.abs(-123.45);
    assert x >= 0;
    System.out.println(x);
}
```

The statement `assert x >= 0;` is an assertion. The condition `x >= 0` is expected to be true. If the result is false, the assertion fails, and an `AssertionError` is thrown.

When using `assert`, you can also add an optional assertion message:

```java
assert x >= 0 : "x must >= 0";
```

With this, when the assertion fails, `AssertionError` will include the message "x must >= 0," which is more helpful for debugging.

A key characteristic of Java assertions is that a failed assertion throws an `AssertionError`, causing the program to terminate. Therefore, assertions should not be used for recoverable program errors and should <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">only be used during development and testing</mark>.

For recoverable program errors, assertions should not be used. For example:

```java
void sort(int[] arr) {
    assert arr != null;
}
```

Instead, an exception should be thrown and caught at a higher level:

```java
void sort(int[] arr) {
    if (arr == null) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("array cannot be null");
    }
}
```

When we use `assert` in a program, such as a simple assertion:

```java
// assert
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = -1;
        assert x > 0;
        System.out.println(x);
    }
}
```

The assertion that `x` must be greater than 0 will certainly fail since `x` is -1. However, upon executing the above code, the program does not throw an `AssertionError` but instead prints the value of `x` normally.

This happens because the JVM disables assertion instructions by default, meaning it automatically ignores `assert` statements and does not execute them.

To execute `assert` statements, you must pass the `-enableassertions` (abbreviated as `-ea`) parameter to the Java Virtual Machine to enable assertions. So, the above program needs to be run from the command line to take effect:

```bash
$ java -ea Main.java
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.AssertionError
    at Main.main(Main.java:5)
```

You can also enable assertions for a specific class by using the command-line parameter: `-ea:com.itranswarp.sample.Main`, which only enables assertions for the `com.itranswarp.sample.Main` class.

Or, enable assertions for a specific package using the command-line parameter: `-ea:com.itranswarp.sample...` (note there are three dots at the end), which means enabling assertions for the `com.itranswarp.sample` package.

In actual development, assertions are rarely used. A better approach is to write unit tests, which we will discuss later with the use of JUnit.

**Summary**
- Assertions are a debugging tool. A failed assertion throws an `AssertionError` and should only be enabled during development and testing.
- Assertions should not be used for recoverable errors; exceptions should be thrown instead.
- Assertions are rarely used in practice. Writing unit tests is a more effective approach.
