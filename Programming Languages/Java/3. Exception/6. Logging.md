When you find that the program's output is not what you expect, a common approach is to use `System.out.println()` to print out certain variables during execution. This helps to observe if the results at each step match the logic of the code, and then you can modify the code accordingly.

Once the code is fixed, the next step is typically to remove the unnecessary `System.out.println()` statements. However, if new issues arise, you might find yourself adding `System.out.println()` back into the code. Repeating this process several times can quickly become tedious.

**What is Logging?**
Logging is intended to replace `System.out.println()`. Using logging instead of `System.out.println()` has several advantages:

- You can set the output style, avoiding repetitive "ERROR: " + var.
- You can set output levels, filtering out logs below a certain level.
- Output can be redirected to a file for post-run analysis.
- Log levels can be controlled by package, allowing selective logging from certain parts of the application.
- ...and many more benefits.

**How to Use Logging?**

Since the Java standard library includes the logging package `java.util.logging`, we can use it directly. Here's a simple example:

```java
// logging
import java.util.logging.Level;
import java.util.logging.Logger;

public class Hello {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Logger logger = Logger.getGlobal();
        logger.info("start process...");
        logger.warning("memory is running out...");
        logger.fine("ignored.");
        logger.severe("process will be terminated...");
    }
}
```

When you run the above code, you get output like:

```
Mar 02, 2019 6:32:13 PM Hello main
INFO: start process...
Mar 02, 2019 6:32:13 PM Hello main
WARNING: memory is running out...
Mar 02, 2019 6:32:13 PM Hello main
SEVERE: process will be terminated...
```

The major benefit of using logging is that it automatically prints useful information like time, calling class, and calling method.

You'll notice that out of the four log statements, only three are printed - `logger.fine()` is not. This is because log output can be set to different levels. JDK's Logging defines seven levels of logging, from severe to fine:

- SEVERE
- WARNING
- INFO
- CONFIG
- FINE
- FINER
- FINEST

Since the default level is INFO, logs below this level will not be printed. Using log levels is beneficial as it allows filtering out many debug-related log outputs.

**Limitations of Java's Built-in Logging:**

- The Logging system is initialized during JVM startup and canâ€™t be modified once the `main()` method starts running.
- Configuration is not very convenient, requiring passing parameters to JVM at startup with `-Djava.util.logging.config.file=<config-file-name>`.

Therefore, Java's built-in Logging is not very widely used.
