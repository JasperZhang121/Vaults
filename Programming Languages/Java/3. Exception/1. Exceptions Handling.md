1.  **Throwing Exceptions:** Exceptions are thrown using the `throw` statement, which creates an instance of an exception object and sends it to the appropriate catch block.
    
2.  **Catching Exceptions:** Exceptions are caught using the `catch` statement, which specifies the type of exception to catch and the code to execute when the exception is caught.
    
3.  **Handling Multiple Exceptions:** Multiple catch blocks can be used to handle different types of exceptions that may occur.
    
4.  **The Finally Block:** The finally block contains code that is always executed, regardless of whether an exception is thrown or caught. This is typically used for cleanup tasks or other important operations that must be done, even if an exception occurs.
    
5.  **Exception Propagation:** When an exception is not caught, it is propagated up the call stack until it reaches the top-level caller, where the program may terminate with an error message.
