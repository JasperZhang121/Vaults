In a Java program, classes are typically organized into different packages. For classes within the same package, they are considered to be at the same level and do not have a parent-child relationship. For example:

```
java.lang
├── Math
├── Runnable
├── String
└── ...
```

There is another type of class called an "inner class" that is defined within another class. Inner classes are categorized into different types in Java, and although they are not commonly used, it's important to understand how they work.

1. **Inner Class:**
   If a class is defined within another class, it is known as an inner class. For example:

   ```java
   class Outer {
       class Inner {
           // Inner class definition
       }
   }
   ```

   In the above example, `Outer` is a regular class, while `Inner` is an inner class. The key difference is that instances of an inner class cannot exist independently; they must be associated with an instance of the outer class. Here's an example of how to instantiate an inner class:

   ```java
   Outer outer = new Outer("Nested"); // Instantiate Outer
   Outer.Inner inner = outer.new Inner(); // Instantiate Inner
   inner.hello();
   ```

   The instantiation of an inner class cannot be done without first creating an instance of the outer class because the inner class implicitly holds a reference to an instance of the outer class (accessible using `Outer.this`). Inner classes also have the privilege of accessing private fields and methods of the outer class because their scope is within the outer class.

2. **Anonymous Class:**
   Another way to define inner classes is by using anonymous classes. Anonymous classes are defined within a method and do not have an explicit name. For example:

   ```java
   public class Outer {
       private String name;

       Outer(String name) {
           this.name = name;
       }

       void asyncHello() {
           Runnable r = new Runnable() {
               @Override
               public void run() {
                   System.out.println("Hello, " + Outer.this.name);
               }
           };
           new Thread(r).start();
       }
   }
   ```

   In this example, an anonymous class implementing the `Runnable` interface is defined within the `asyncHello` method. Anonymous classes can also access private fields and methods of the outer class. They are often used when the class name is not important.

3. **Static Nested Class:**
   Static nested classes are similar to inner classes, but they are declared with the `static` keyword. They do not depend on an instance of the outer class and are independent. However, they can still access private static fields and methods of the outer class. For example:

   ```java
   public class Outer {
       private static String NAME = "OUTER";

       static class StaticNested {
           void hello() {
               System.out.println("Hello, " + Outer.NAME);
           }
       }
   }
   ```

   Static nested classes do not have access to non-static members of the outer class and cannot use `Outer.this`.
