We already know that Java has two kinds of data types:

1. Primitive types: byte, short, int, long, boolean, float, double, char.
2. Reference types: all class and interface types.

Reference types can be assigned as `null` to represent emptiness, but primitive types cannot be assigned as `null`, like this:

```java
String s = null;
int n = null; // compile error!
```

So, how can we treat a primitive type as an object (reference type)?

For example, if we want to treat the `int` primitive type as an object, we can define an `Integer` class that contains only one instance field of type `int`. This way, the `Integer` class can be considered as a wrapper class for `int`:

```java
public class Integer {
    private int value;

    public Integer(int value) {
        this.value = value;
    }

    public int intValue() {
        return this.value;
    }
}
```

Once we have defined the `Integer` class, we can convert between `int` and `Integer`:

```java
Integer n = null;
Integer n2 = new Integer(99);
int n3 = n2.intValue();
```

In fact, because wrapper classes are very useful, the Java core library provides a wrapper class for each primitive type:

- `boolean` corresponds to `java.lang.Boolean`
- `byte` corresponds to `java.lang.Byte`
- `short` corresponds to `java.lang.Short`
- `int` corresponds to `java.lang.Integer`
- `long` corresponds to `java.lang.Long`
- `float` corresponds to `java.lang.Float`
- `double` corresponds to `java.lang.Double`
- `char` corresponds to `java.lang.Character`

You can use them directly; there's no need to define your own:

```java
// Integer:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int i = 100;
        // Create an Integer instance using the new operator (not recommended, generates a compilation warning):
        Integer n1 = new Integer(i);
        // Create an Integer instance using the static valueOf(int) method:
        Integer n2 = Integer.valueOf(i);
        // Create an Integer instance using the static valueOf(String) method:
        Integer n3 = Integer.valueOf("100");
        System.out.println(n3.intValue());
    }
}
```

Auto Boxing:

Because `int` and `Integer` can be converted to each other:

```java
int i = 100;
Integer n = Integer.valueOf(i);
int x = n.intValue();
```

The Java compiler can automatically perform type conversion between `int` and `Integer`:

```java
Integer n = 100; // The compiler automatically uses Integer.valueOf(int)
int x = n; // The compiler automatically uses Integer.intValue()
```

This direct assignment of `int` to `Integer` is called "Auto Boxing," and vice versa, converting `Integer` to `int` is called "Auto Unboxing."

Note: Auto boxing and auto unboxing occur at compile time to reduce the amount of code you need to write.

Boxing and unboxing can affect code execution efficiency because the compiled class code strictly distinguishes between primitive types and reference types. Also, auto unboxing may lead to a `NullPointerException`:

```java
// NullPointerException
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Integer n = null;
        int i = n;
    }
}
```

Immutable Classes:

All wrapper classes are immutable. If we look at the source code of `Integer`, we can see that its core code is as follows:

```java
public final class Integer {
    private final int value;
}
```

Therefore, once an `Integer` object is created, it is immutable.

When comparing two `Integer` instances, we should be careful. We should never use `==` for comparison because `Integer` is a reference type, and we must use `equals()` for comparison:

```java
// == or equals?
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Integer x = 127;
        Integer y = 127;
        Integer m = 99999;
        Integer n = 99999;
        System.out.println("x == y: " + (x == y)); // true
        System.out.println("m == n: " + (m == n)); // false
        System.out.println("x.equals(y): " + x.equals(y)); // true
        System.out.println("m.equals(n): " + m.equals(n)); // true
    }
}
```

If you look closely at the results, you can see that `==` comparison returns `true` for the smaller two equal `Integer` instances and `false` for the larger two equal `Integer` instances. This happens because `Integer` is an immutable class, and the compiler optimizes the code to return the same instance for smaller numbers. However, we should never rely on this behavior. Always use the `equals()` method to compare `Integer` instances.

Programming according to semantics, rather than optimizing for specific underlying implementations.

When creating new `Integer` objects, it's recommended to use the following two methods:

Method 1: `Integer n = new Integer(100);`
Method 2: `Integer n = Integer.valueOf(100);`

Method 2 is preferred because Method 1 always creates a new `Integer` instance, while Method 2 leaves the internal optimization to the implementer of `Integer`. Even if there is no optimization in the current version, there may be optimizations in the next version.

We call static methods that can create "new" objects static factory methods. `Integer.valueOf()` is a static factory method that attempts to return cached instances whenever possible to save memory.

Creating new objects should prioritize using static factory methods over the `new` operator.

Java's wrapper types also provide many useful static variables:

- `Boolean` provides `TRUE` and `FALSE` for the two `boolean` values.
- `Integer` provides `MAX_VALUE` and `MIN_VALUE` for the maximum and minimum values an `int` can hold.
- `Long` provides information about the number of bits and bytes used to represent a `long`.
- Other wrapper types have similar constants.

Converting Between Data Types:

In Java, there is no primitive data type for unsigned integers. `byte`, `short`, `int`, and `long` are all signed integers, with the highest bit as the sign bit. C language, on the other hand, provides all data types supported by the CPU, including unsigned integers. To convert between signed and unsigned integers in Java, you can use static methods provided by the wrapper types.

For example, `byte` is a signed integer with a range of -128 to +127. However, if you treat it as an unsigned integer, its range is 0 to 255. You can convert a negative `byte` to an `int` using the `Byte.toUnsignedInt()` method:

```java
// Byte
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        byte x = -1;
        byte y = 127;
        System.out.println(Byte.toUnsignedInt(x)); // 255
        System.out.println(Byte.toUnsignedInt(y)); // 127
    }
}
```

This is because the binary representation of `-1` in `byte` ("00000001"->"11111110"->"11111111")
