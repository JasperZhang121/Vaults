### Using Stream

Starting from Java 8, Java introduced not only **Lambda expressions**, but also a completely new streaming API: the **Stream API**, located in the `java.util.stream` package.

**Key Point**: This Stream is different from `java.io`'s `InputStream` and `OutputStream`. It represents a sequence of arbitrary Java objects. Here's a comparison:

| Type              | `java.io`                    | `java.util.stream`                  |
|-------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Storage**        | Byte or char read/write in sequence | Sequence of arbitrary Java objects |
| **Purpose**        | Serialize to file or network | In-memory computation / business logic |

One might ask: isn't a sequence of Java objects similar to a `List` container?

**Key Difference**: Stream and List are different. In a List, each element is a pre-stored Java object in memory, while a Stream's elements may not be pre-stored in memory and can be computed in real-time.

In other words, List operates on a group of pre-existing Java objects, while Stream enables **lazy evaluation**. Here's a comparison:

| Type              | `java.util.List`              | `java.util.stream`                  |
|-------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Element**        | Allocated and stored in memory | May not be allocated, computed in real-time |
| **Purpose**        | Operate on existing Java objects | Lazy evaluation |

Stream might seem hard to grasp initially, but let's take an example to clarify it.

Suppose we want to represent the collection of all natural numbers. Obviously, using a List is impossible because natural numbers are infinite, and no amount of memory can hold them:

```java
List<BigInteger> list = ???; // All natural numbers?
```

But using Stream, we can achieve this:

```java
Stream<BigInteger> naturals = createNaturalStream(); // All natural numbers
```

Letâ€™s not worry about how `createNaturalStream()` works for now and focus on using the Stream.

First, we can square each natural number, transforming this Stream into another Stream:

```java
Stream<BigInteger> naturals = createNaturalStream(); // All natural numbers
Stream<BigInteger> streamNxN = naturals.map(n -> n.multiply(n)); // Squares of natural numbers
```

Since `streamNxN` has an infinite number of elements, we need to limit it to a finite number before printing. We can use the `limit()` method to extract the first 100 elements and then use `forEach()` to process each element, like so:

```java
Stream<BigInteger> naturals = createNaturalStream();
naturals.map(n -> n.multiply(n)) // 1, 4, 9, 16, 25...
        .limit(100)
        .forEach(System.out::println);
```

### Characteristics of Stream

1. **"Storage" of Finite or Infinite Elements**: Here, "storage" is in quotes because the elements may be pre-stored in memory or calculated in real-time as needed.
2. **Stream Transformation**: A Stream can be easily transformed into another Stream, rather than modifying the original Stream.
3. **Lazy Evaluation**: The actual computation happens only when the final result is retrieved.

```java
Stream<BigInteger> naturals = createNaturalStream(); // No computation
Stream<BigInteger> s2 = naturals.map(n -> n.multiply(n)); // No computation
Stream<BigInteger> s3 = s2.limit(100); // No computation
s3.forEach(System.out::println); // Computation happens here
```

**Lazy Evaluation** means that when one Stream is transformed into another, only the transformation rules are stored, and no computation occurs until necessary.

For instance:
- Creating a Stream of all natural numbers does not trigger any computation.
- Transforming it into `s2` by squaring the numbers does not trigger any computation either.
- Converting `s2` (an infinite Stream) into `s3` (a finite Stream) also does not trigger any computation.
- The actual computation only happens when `forEach` is called, which requests the Stream's elements.

Typically, we write Stream operations as **chain operations**, making the code more concise:

```java
createNaturalStream()
    .map(n -> n.multiply(n))
    .limit(100)
    .forEach(System.out::println);
```

### Basic Usage of Stream API

The basic usage pattern of the Stream API is:
1. **Create** a Stream.
2. **Transform** the Stream zero or more times.
3. **Evaluate** the result using a terminal operation.

For example:

```java
int result = createNaturalStream()  // Create a Stream
             .filter(n -> n % 2 == 0)  // Any number of transformations
             .map(n -> n * n)  // Any number of transformations
             .limit(100)  // Any number of transformations
             .sum();  // Final computation
```

In this case:
- We create a Stream of natural numbers.
- We filter the Stream to retain only even numbers.
- We square the numbers.
- We limit the Stream to the first 100 numbers.
- Finally, we sum the results. The computation happens only at this last step.
