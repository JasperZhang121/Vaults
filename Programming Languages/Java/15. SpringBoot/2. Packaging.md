In the **Maven Plugins** section, we introduced how to use the `maven-shade-plugin` to create an executable JAR file. Packaging a Spring Boot application is even simpler because Spring Boot includes the `spring-boot-maven-plugin`, which is specifically designed for this purpose. To enable it, just add the following configuration to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<project ...>
    ...
    <build>
        <plugins>
            <plugin>
                <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
                <artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
    </build>
</project>
```

No additional configuration is needed. The plugin automatically detects the application's main class. To package your application, simply run the following Maven command:

```bash
$ mvn clean package
```

For example, in a project named `springboot-exec-jar`, the command will produce two JAR files in the `target` directory:

```bash
$ ls
classes
generated-sources
maven-archiver
maven-status
springboot-exec-jar-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
springboot-exec-jar-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar.original
```

- `springboot-exec-jar-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar.original` is a standard Maven-built JAR that includes only your application’s classes, without dependencies.
- `springboot-exec-jar-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` is the executable JAR created by the Spring Boot plugin. It includes all dependencies and can be run directly:

```bash
$ java -jar springboot-exec-jar-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

This makes deploying a Spring Boot application incredibly straightforward—no pre-installed servers are required. You simply upload the JAR file and execute it.

#### Excluding `spring-boot-devtools`

When packaging, `spring-boot-devtools` is excluded by default because the packaged application is typically not meant to be modified. However, if you are using an older version of Spring Boot, you may need to explicitly exclude it with this configuration:

```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <configuration>
        <excludeDevtools>true</excludeDevtools>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
```

#### Customizing the JAR Name

If you prefer a custom name for the JAR file instead of the default project name and version, you can add the following configuration:

```xml
<project ...>
    ...
    <build>
        <finalName>awesome-app</finalName>
        ...
    </build>
</project>
```

This will result in a packaged file named `awesome-app.jar`.
