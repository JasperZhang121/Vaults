In production environments, monitoring an application’s state is crucial. Previously, we discussed using JMX to monitor Java applications and the JVM by exposing monitoring information as MBeans to a JMX Server. Spring Boot simplifies this process by providing a built-in monitoring tool called **Actuator**.

#### Adding Actuator

To enable Actuator, add the following dependency to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

After adding the dependency, simply start the application. Actuator automatically collects and exposes various pieces of monitoring information. By default, this data is available to JMX. Additionally, Actuator mounts several monitoring endpoints accessible via URLs.

#### Checking Application Health

For example, you can check the application’s health by accessing the following URL:

```
http://localhost:8080/actuator/health
```

The response will look like this:

```json
{
    "status": "UP"
}
```

This endpoint is particularly useful for load balancers or reverse proxies to probe backend services’ health.

#### Exposing Additional Endpoints

By default, Actuator exposes all endpoints to JMX but restricts access to only the `health` and `info` endpoints via the web for security reasons. The complete list of Actuator endpoints is available in the [official documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/actuator.html).

To expose more endpoints over the web, add the following configuration to your `application.yml`:

```yaml
management:
  endpoints:
    web:
      exposure:
        include: info, health, beans, env, metrics
```

#### Security Considerations

It’s important to carefully control which endpoints are exposed via the web, as some, like `/actuator/env`, reveal sensitive information such as environment variables. **Never expose such endpoints to the public internet.**
