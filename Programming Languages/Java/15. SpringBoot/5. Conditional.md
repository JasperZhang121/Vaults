While **Profiles** allow for conditional bean registration based on the active profile, they lack the granularity needed for scenarios involving multiple configurations. For instance, managing storage types such as **local storage**, **AWS storage**, **Alibaba Cloud storage**, or potentially **Azure storage** in the future becomes unwieldy with Profiles.

Spring provides the `@Conditional` annotation for more granular control. However, writing custom `Condition` implementations can be cumbersome. To simplify this, Spring Boot offers several ready-to-use conditional annotations:

### Common Conditional Annotations

1. **`@ConditionalOnProperty`**: Activates a bean if a specific property is defined or has a certain value.
2. **`@ConditionalOnBean`**: Activates a bean if a specific bean exists in the context.
3. **`@ConditionalOnMissingBean`**: Activates a bean if a specific bean does not exist in the context.
4. **`@ConditionalOnMissingClass`**: Activates a bean if a specific class is not on the classpath.
5. **`@ConditionalOnWebApplication`**: Activates a bean in a web application context.
6. **`@ConditionalOnExpression`**: Activates a bean based on the evaluation of a SpEL (Spring Expression Language) expression.

### Example: Using `@ConditionalOnProperty`

Letâ€™s rewrite the `StorageService` example using `@ConditionalOnProperty` for better flexibility. We'll define a property `storage.type` in the configuration file to control which implementation to activate.

#### Configuration in `application.yml`

```yaml
storage:
  type: ${STORAGE_TYPE:local}
```

- Default value: `local`
- The property determines which storage service to activate.

#### Local Storage Implementation

```java
@Component
@ConditionalOnProperty(value = "storage.type", havingValue = "local", matchIfMissing = true)
public class LocalStorageService implements StorageService {
    // Implementation for local storage
    ...
}
```

- `value`: Specifies the property name (`storage.type`).
- `havingValue`: The property value (`local`) that activates this bean.
- `matchIfMissing`: If the property is not defined, this bean is activated.

#### AWS Storage Implementation

```java
@Component
@ConditionalOnProperty(value = "storage.type", havingValue = "aws")
public class AwsStorageService implements StorageService {
    // Implementation for AWS storage
    ...
}
```

- Activates only when `storage.type` is explicitly set to `aws`.

#### Alibaba Cloud Storage Implementation

```java
@Component
@ConditionalOnProperty(value = "storage.type", havingValue = "aliyun")
public class AliyunStorageService implements StorageService {
    // Implementation for Alibaba Cloud storage
    ...
}
```

- Activates only when `storage.type` is explicitly set to `aliyun`.

### Key Points

- The **default** service (`LocalStorageService`) is activated if:
    
    - The `storage.type` property is not set.
    - The `storage.type` property is explicitly set to `local`.
- Other implementations (`AwsStorageService`, `AliyunStorageService`) are activated based on specific property values.

### Benefits of Conditional Annotations

- **Granular Control**: Allows precise control over which beans to activate based on runtime conditions.
- **Flexibility**: Easily extendable to new conditions (e.g., adding Azure storage in the future).
- **Readability**: Clear and declarative configuration.

By using `@ConditionalOnProperty` and other conditional annotations, you can design flexible, environment-aware Spring Boot applications.
