### Adding a Filter

In Spring, adding a filter typically involves configuring a `web.xml` file or registering the filter programmatically. This process can be cumbersome. In Spring Boot, however, adding a filter is significantly simpler and can be done without any manual configuration.

### Automatic Filter Registration

Spring Boot automatically scans for all `FilterRegistrationBean` instances and registers the returned `Filter` objects with the Servlet container. This eliminates the need for additional configuration.

### Example: AuthFilter

Here’s how to add an authentication filter using `FilterRegistrationBean`:

```java
@Component
public class AuthFilterRegistrationBean extends FilterRegistrationBean<Filter> {

    @Autowired
    UserService userService;

    @Override
    public Filter getFilter() {
        setOrder(10); // Set execution order for the filter
        return new AuthFilter();
    }

    class AuthFilter implements Filter {
        @Override
        public void doFilter(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response, FilterChain chain)
                throws IOException, ServletException {
            // Authentication logic
            chain.doFilter(request, response);
        }
    }
}
```

#### Key Points:

1. **`FilterRegistrationBean`**: Acts as a factory for creating and registering filters.
2. **Dependency Injection**: `AuthFilter` can access the `UserService` because it’s defined as an inner class of `AuthFilterRegistrationBean`, which is a Spring-managed component.
3. **Order of Execution**: The `setOrder(10)` method ensures that this filter runs before filters with higher order values. Filters with smaller numbers are executed first.

### Example: ApiFilter

If you want to filter specific URLs (e.g., `/api/*`), you can configure the filter as follows:

```java
@Component
public class ApiFilterRegistrationBean extends FilterRegistrationBean<Filter> {

    @PostConstruct
    public void init() {
        setOrder(20); // Set execution order
        setFilter(new ApiFilter());
        setUrlPatterns(List.of("/api/*")); // Apply to specific URL patterns
    }

    class ApiFilter implements Filter {
        @Override
        public void doFilter(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response, FilterChain chain)
                throws IOException, ServletException {
            // Filter logic for /api/* URLs
            chain.doFilter(request, response);
        }
    }
}
```

#### Key Points:

1. **Filtering Specific URLs**: Use `setUrlPatterns()` to define the URL patterns to be filtered.
2. **Post-Initialization**: The `@PostConstruct` method is used to configure the `Filter` instance and its URL patterns after the `ApiFilterRegistrationBean` is instantiated.

### Filter Order

In Spring Boot, the order of multiple filters is determined by their `setOrder()` values. Filters with lower values are executed first. This allows you to control the execution sequence of filters in your application.

### Summary

Adding filters in Spring Boot is straightforward:

1. Define a `FilterRegistrationBean` for each filter.
2. Use `setFilter()` to specify the filter.
3. Optionally use `setUrlPatterns()` to target specific URLs.
4. Use `setOrder()` to control the execution order.

This approach leverages Spring’s IoC container and eliminates the need for explicit Servlet container configuration.
