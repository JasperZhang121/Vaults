During the development phase, we often modify code and then restart the Spring Boot application. Manually stopping and starting the application repeatedly can be cumbersome.

Spring Boot provides a **Developer Tools** feature that monitors files on the classpath. When source code or configuration files are modified, the Spring Boot application can automatically restart. This feature is particularly useful during development.

To use this developer tool, simply add the following dependency to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-devtools</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

And thatâ€™s it! Start your application, make changes to your source code, save, and watch the logs. Spring Boot will automatically reload the application.

By default, changes to files in the `/static`, `/public`, and `/templates` directories do **not** trigger a restart because caching is disabled for these resources, allowing real-time updates without the need for a restart.
