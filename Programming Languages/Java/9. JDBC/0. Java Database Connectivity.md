Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) is a Java API for connecting to and interacting with databases. It provides a set of classes and interfaces that allow Java applications to interact with databases in a standardized way. JDBC is part of the Java Standard Edition (Java SE) platform and is included in all Java distributions.

## Introduction to JDBC

JDBC provides a way for Java applications to communicate with databases using the SQL language. JDBC defines a set of standard interfaces that can be implemented by different database vendors. This allows Java applications to communicate with different types of databases without having to worry about the specifics of each database.

## JDBC Architecture

The JDBC architecture consists of two layers:

1.  JDBC API
2.  JDBC driver API

The JDBC API provides a set of interfaces and classes for developers to use in their applications. The JDBC driver API provides a set of interfaces and classes that are used by driver vendors to develop JDBC drivers for specific databases.

## JDBC Drivers

JDBC drivers are used by applications to connect to databases. There are four types of JDBC drivers:

1.  Type 1: JDBC-ODBC Bridge driver
2.  Type 2: Native-API/partly Java driver
3.  Type 3: Network-protocol/all-Java driver
4.  Type 4: Native-protocol/all-Java driver

## Connecting to a Database

To connect to a database using JDBC, the following steps need to be taken:

1.  Load the JDBC driver.
2.  Open a connection to the database.
3.  Create a statement.
4.  Execute the statement.
5.  Process the results.
6.  Close the connection.

## JDBC API

The JDBC API consists of a set of classes and interfaces that provide the following functionality:

1.  Connecting to a database
2.  Executing SQL statements
3.  Retrieving and processing results
4.  Retrieving metadata about the database and its objects

## JDBC Statements

JDBC statements are used to execute SQL statements on a database. There are three types of statements:

1.  Statement: used for executing simple SQL statements.
2.  PreparedStatement: used for executing SQL statements that may contain parameters.
3.  CallableStatement: used for executing stored procedures.

## JDBC ResultSet

JDBC ResultSet is an interface that represents the results of an SQL query. It provides methods for retrieving data from the query result.

### Example

```java
import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import java.sql.ResultSet;
import java.sql.SQLException;
import java.sql.Statement;

public class JdbcExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        // JDBC driver name and database URL
        String JDBC_DRIVER = "com.mysql.jdbc.Driver";
        String DB_URL = "jdbc:mysql://localhost/employees";

        // Database credentials
        String USER = "root";
        String PASS = "password";

        Connection conn = null;
        Statement stmt = null;
        try {
            // Register JDBC driver
            Class.forName(JDBC_DRIVER);

            // Open a connection
            System.out.println("Connecting to database...");
            conn = DriverManager.getConnection(DB_URL, USER, PASS);

            // Execute a query
            System.out.println("Creating statement...");
            stmt = conn.createStatement();
            String sql = "SELECT id, first_name, last_name FROM employees";
            ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(sql);

            // Extract data from result set
            while (rs.next()) {
                // Retrieve by column name
                int id = rs.getInt("id");
                String first = rs.getString("first_name");
                String last = rs.getString("last_name");

                // Display values
                System.out.print("ID: " + id);
                System.out.print(", First Name: " + first);
                System.out.println(", Last Name: " + last);
            }
            // Clean-up environment
            rs.close();
            stmt.close();
            conn.close();
        } catch (SQLException se) {
            // Handle errors for JDBC
            se.printStackTrace();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            // Handle errors for Class.forName
            e.printStackTrace();
        } finally {
            // Finally block used to close resources
            try {
                if (stmt != null) {
                    stmt.close();
                }
            } catch (SQLException se2) {
            } // nothing we can do
            try {
                if (conn != null) {
                    conn.close();
                }
            } catch (SQLException se) {
                se.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
        System.out.println("Goodbye!");
    }
}
