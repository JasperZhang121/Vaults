### What is Nacos?
Nacos is a new open-source project launched by Alibaba. It is a dynamic service discovery, configuration management, and service management platform designed to simplify the construction of cloud-native applications.

Nacos helps you discover, configure, and manage microservices. It provides a set of easy-to-use features to quickly implement dynamic service discovery, configuration, service metadata, and traffic management.

Nacos allows you to build, deliver, and manage microservice platforms more easily and efficiently. It serves as the service infrastructure for building <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">service-centric</mark> modern applications, such as microservice architectures and cloud-native environments.

### Nacos Capabilities
Nacos focuses on managing services and supports all mainstream service discovery, configuration, and management frameworks. Nacos mainly provides the following four functions:

1. **Service Discovery and Health Monitoring**
2. **Dynamic Configuration Management**
3. **Dynamic DNS Service**
4. **Service and Metadata Management**

### Architecture Overview
The architecture of Nacos is depicted below:

![[nacos.png]]
### Getting Started with Nacos

To demonstrate Nacos, create two projects: 
1. `nacos-provider` (the service provider) 
2. `nacos-consumer` (the service consumer)

#### Nacos Provider

- Add the following dependencies:

```xml
<!-- Service Discovery Dependency -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.alibaba.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-alibaba-nacos-discovery</artifactId>
    <version>2.1.2.RELEASE</version>
</dependency>
<!-- Service Configuration Dependency -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.alibaba.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-alibaba-nacos-config</artifactId>
    <version>2.1.2.RELEASE</version>
</dependency>
```

- Basic Provider Code:

```java
@RestController
public class ProviderController {
    @GetMapping("invoke")
    public String invoke() {
        return LocalTime.now() + " invoke";
    }
}
```

- `application.yml` Configuration:

```yml
server:
  port: 8070
spring:
  application:
    name: nacos-provider
  cloud:
    nacos:
      server-addr: 127.0.0.1:8848  # Nacos server address
```

In the main class, add the `@EnableDiscoveryClient` annotation.

#### Nacos Consumer

- Add the following dependencies for the consumer:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-openfeign</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.alibaba.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-alibaba-nacos-discovery</artifactId>
    <version>2.1.2.RELEASE</version>
</dependency>
```

- Consumer Controller Code:

```java
@RestController
public class ConsumerController {
    @Autowired
    private ProviderFeign providerFeign;

    @GetMapping("/test")
    public String test() {
        return providerFeign.invoke();
    }
}
```

- `application.yml` Configuration for Consumer:

```yml
server:
  port: 8071
spring:
  application:
    name: nacos-consumer
  cloud:
    nacos:
      server-addr: 127.0.0.1:8848  # Nacos server address
```

### Nacos Configuration Center Introduction

During system development, developers usually separate parameters and variables that may need to be changed from the code and manage them independently in the form of configuration files. The purpose is to better adapt the static system artifacts or deliverables (such as WAR, JAR packages, etc.) to the actual physical runtime environment. Configuration management is usually part of the system deployment process, handled by system administrators or operations personnel. Changing configurations is an effective way to adjust system behavior at runtime.

#### Problems without a Unified Configuration Center in a Microservice Architecture:

- **Scattered configuration files**: Configuration files are distributed across multiple projects, making maintenance cumbersome.
- **Security and access control**: Managing access and ensuring configuration security becomes challenging.
- **Service restart required for updates**: When configurations are updated, services often need to be restarted.

#### Nacos Configuration Center:
Nacos provides centralized configuration management, including editing, storing, and distributing configurations. It also supports dynamic updates without restarting services, rollback of configurations (change management, version history management, change auditing), and all other configuration-related activities.

### Integration of Nacos with Spring Cloud

1. **DataId Format in Nacos Spring Cloud:**

   The complete format of `dataId` in Nacos Spring Cloud is as follows:

   ```
   ${prefix}-${spring.profile.active}.${file-extension}
   ```

   - `prefix`: Defaults to the value of `spring.application.name` (e.g., `nacos-provider`), but can also be configured using `spring.cloud.nacos.config.prefix`.
   - `spring.profile.active`: Refers to the current environment profile. For more details, refer to the [Spring Boot documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-profiles). **Note**: If `spring.profile.active` is empty, the hyphen (`-`) will be omitted, resulting in the format `${prefix}.${file-extension}`.
   - `file-extension`: Specifies the format of the configuration file, which can be configured with `spring.cloud.nacos.config.file-extension`. Supported types are `properties` and `yaml`, with `properties` as the default.

   In summary, the `dataId` format is `spring.application.name + "." + properties/yml`.

   For more details, refer to the [official Nacos documentation](https://nacos.io/zh-cn/docs/quick-start-spring-cloud.html) and [Spring Cloud Alibaba documentation](https://github.com/alibaba/spring-cloud-alibaba/wiki/Nacos-config).

2. **Configuration Content**: These are the variable contents of a project. To read configurations from the configuration center, you must add the necessary dependencies:

   ```xml
   <dependency>
       <groupId>com.alibaba.cloud</groupId>
       <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-alibaba-nacos-config</artifactId>
       <version>2.1.2.RELEASE</version>
   </dependency>
   ```

   Refer to the version explanations at the [Alibaba Spring Cloud Wiki](https://github.com/alibaba/spring-cloud-alibaba/wiki/版本说明).

   Configure the Nacos server address and application name in `bootstrap.yml`:

   ```yml
   spring:
     cloud:
       nacos:
         server-addr: 127.0.0.1:8848
     application:
       name: nacos-provider
   ```

   **Note**: When `spring.application.name` is configured in `bootstrap.yml`, it does not need to be added again in `application.yml`. The reason for configuring `spring.application.name` is that it forms part of the `dataId` field in Nacos configuration management. In a Spring Boot project, `bootstrap.properties` has a higher loading priority.

3. **Code Example for Dynamic Configuration Refresh**:

   ```java
   @RefreshScope
   @RestController
   public class ProviderController {
       @Value("${DevConfig}")
       private String devConfig;

       @GetMapping("invoke")
       public String invoke() {
           return LocalTime.now() + " invoke, devConfig: " + devConfig;
       }
   }
   ```

   By using the `@RefreshScope` annotation, Nacos can dynamically refresh configurations without requiring a service restart.

### Namespace Switching for Environments

In actual development, there are typically multiple environments (by default, only `public` exists). You can create different namespaces to isolate different environments, such as development, testing, and production. This allows one Nacos cluster to manage multiple namespaces, ensuring isolation between environments.

For example, you could create three namespaces (`prod`, `dev`, and `test`) for different environments. Additionally, different projects can share the same Nacos service by creating new namespaces, rather than requiring a separate Nacos service for each project. The default namespace is `public`.

Namespaces help manage configurations specific to different environments. For example, in the `dev` namespace, you can create a configuration file `nacos-provider.properties`. There are two ways to configure this:

- **Switch to the `dev` namespace**: Manually add a new configuration file. **Drawback**: Each environment requires repetitive configuration.
- **Clone the configuration**: Clone the configuration from another environment and modify it as needed (recommended).

### Loading Multiple Configuration Files

Occasionally, you may need to load multiple configuration files. For instance, if there are three configuration files in the `dev` namespace (`nacos-provider.properties`, `redis.properties`, `jdbc.properties`), and you want to load all three, you can add the following configuration to `bootstrap.yml`:

```yml
spring:
  cloud:
    nacos:
      server-addr: 127.0.0.1:8848
      config:
        extension-configs:
          - refresh: true
            data-id: redis.properties
          - refresh: true
            data-id: jdbc.properties
```

The `@RefreshScope` annotation ensures that the configuration is automatically refreshed.

```java
@RefreshScope
@RestController
public class ProviderController {
    @Value("${DevConfig}")
    private String devConfig;

    @Value("${jdbc.url}")
    private String jdbcUrl;

    @Value("${redis.url}")
    private String redisUrl;

    @GetMapping("invoke")
    public String invoke() {
        return LocalTime.now() + " invoke, devConfig: " + devConfig +
               ", jdbcUrl: " + jdbcUrl + ", redisUrl: " + redisUrl;
    }
}
```

### Configuration Grouping

In real development, aside from different environments, different microservices or business functions may use distinct Redis and MySQL databases. This means each microservice project may have its own development, testing, pre-release, and production environments. You can distinguish different environments using namespaces and separate microservices or functions by using groups.

For instance, add a new `redis.properties` configuration file, and assign it to the `nacos-provider` group. There will now be two `redis.properties` files in the development environment: one in the `DEFAULT_GROUP` and another in the `provider` group. By default, the configuration is read from the `DEFAULT_GROUP`. If you want to switch to the `nacos-provider` group, modify the configuration as follows:

```yml
spring:
  cloud:
    nacos:
      server-addr: 127.0.0.1:8848
      config:
        extension-configs:
          - refresh: true
            group: nacos-provider
            data-id: redis.properties
          - refresh: true
            data-id: jdbc.properties
```

By using namespaces and groups, you can isolate configurations by environment and microservice, ensuring that the system remains modular and maintainable.
