### Overview
Elasticsearch (ES) is an open-source, distributed full-text search engine built on Apache Lucene. It serves as a distributed document database where every field can be indexed and searched, enabling it to scale horizontally across hundreds of servers to store and process petabytes of data. This capability allows for rapid storage, search, and analysis of vast amounts of information, making it a core engine for complex search scenarios.

Elasticsearch is designed for high availability and scalability:
- **Vertical Scaling**: This involves enhancing system performance by upgrading existing hardware or purchasing more powerful servers.
- **Horizontal Scaling**: This entails adding more servers to expand the system's capacity.


### Near Real-Time (NRT)

Elasticsearch operates as a near real-time search platform, meaning there is minimal latency between indexing a document and its availability for searchâ€”typically in the millisecond range.

### Cluster

A cluster consists of one or more nodes (servers) that collectively store the entire dataset and provide unified indexing and search capabilities. Each cluster is identified by a unique Cluster ID and is assigned a cluster name (default: "elasticsearch"). This name is crucial for nodes to join the cluster, as a node can only be part of one cluster.

To avoid connection errors, ensure that the same cluster name is not used across different environments. For example, you might use names like `logging-dev`, `logging-stage`, and `logging-prod` for development, staging, and production clusters, respectively.

### Node

A node is an individual server instance that forms part of a cluster, capable of storing data and contributing to indexing and search functions. By default, a node is assigned a random universally unique identifier (UUID) at startup, but it can be configured with a custom name for easier management, allowing you to identify which server corresponds to which Elasticsearch cluster node.

Nodes can be configured to connect to a specific cluster using the cluster name. By default, all nodes attempt to join the cluster named "elasticsearch." If multiple nodes are started on a network and can discover each other, they will automatically form and join the "elasticsearch" cluster.

You can have as many nodes as necessary within a single cluster. If no other nodes are running with the name "elasticsearch" on the same network, a new single-node cluster will be created by default.

### Index

An index is a collection of documents with similar characteristics. For instance, you might create one index for customer data, another for product catalogs, and a third for order data. Each index is identified by a name (which must be lowercase) that is used to reference the index during indexing, searching, updating, and deleting operations. You can define multiple indices within a single cluster.

### Type

Within an index, one or more types can be defined. A type serves as a logical category or partition within the index, with its semantics determined by the user. For example, in a blogging platform that stores all data in a single index, you might define one type for user data, another for blog posts, and yet another for comments.

### Document

A document is the fundamental unit of information that can be indexed. For example, you could have one document for a single customer, another for a product, and a third for an order. Documents are represented in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format, a widely-used data exchange format on the internet.

You can store as many documents as needed within an index/type. It's important to note that while documents physically reside in an index, they must be indexed or assigned to a type within that index.

### Shards and Replicas

An index can contain vast amounts of data that may exceed the hardware limitations of a single node. For example, a billion files consuming 1 TB of disk space may not be manageable by a single node due to storage or performance constraints.

To address this, Elasticsearch allows you to split your index into smaller units called shards. When creating an index, you can specify the number of shards you desire. Each shard functions as a full-fledged, independent index that can be hosted on any node within the cluster.

The significance of shards lies in two main features:
1. Shards enable horizontal scaling or partitioning of the index size.
2. Shards facilitate distributed and parallel operations across multiple nodes, enhancing performance and throughput.

Given that failures can occur in any cluster network or cloud environment, implementing a failover mechanism is vital to prevent shards and nodes from going offline. Elasticsearch allows you to create one or more copies of your index shards, known as replicas.

### Forward Index and Inverted Index

Traditional databases (like MySQL) use a **forward index**, while Elasticsearch uses an **inverted index**.

- **Document**: Each piece of data is treated as a document.
- **Term**: Words derived from the document based on semantic meaning.

**Forward Index**: This index is created based on the document ID. When querying a term, you must first locate the document and then check if it contains the term.

**Inverted Index**: This involves tokenizing the content of the documents, creating an index for the terms, and recording which documents contain each term. When querying, you first find the document IDs associated with the term, then retrieve the documents.

#### Example

Imagine a library database:

- **Forward Index**: If you have a document with ID 1 that contains "Machine Learning," to check if it includes the term "Learning," you'd first find the document by ID and then check its contents.

- **Inverted Index**: If you tokenize the text and index it, when you query "Learning," the system quickly returns all document IDs (like 1, 3, and 5) that contain this term, allowing for faster retrieval of relevant documents.


### Elasticsearch vs. MySQL

#### Document
- **Elasticsearch**: Tailored for document-oriented storage, allowing a single document to encapsulate extensive information, such as product specifications or order details.
- **Storage Format**: Employs JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) for serialization, facilitating a flexible and structured representation of data.

#### Index
- **Index**: Serves as a collection of documents that share common characteristics or types.
- **Mapping**: Establishes the schema for the fields within documents in an index, similar to how constraints are defined for columns in relational database tables.

#### Architectural Comparison
- **MySQL**: Excels in transactional operations, prioritizing data integrity, safety, and consistency through ACID compliance (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).
- **Elasticsearch**: Optimized for search, analysis, and computation of large datasets, enabling rapid retrieval and complex querying.

#### Relationship
- **MySQL**: Manages conventional database functionalities, emphasizing transactional integrity and relational data management.
- **Elasticsearch**: Facilitates large-scale data search, analysis, and computation, making it particularly suitable for applications that demand swift data insights.
