Serialization is the process of converting a Java object into binary content, essentially a `byte[]` array.

Why serialize Java objects? Because once serialized, the `byte[]` can be saved to a file, or transmitted over the network to a remote location, effectively storing or sending the Java object to files or over networks.

Where there's serialization, there's deserialization, which means converting a binary content (a `byte[]` array) back into a Java object. With deserialization, the `byte[]` array saved in a file can "transform back" into a Java object, or the `byte[]` read from the network can be "transformed back" into a Java object.

Let's look at how to serialize a Java object.

A Java object must implement a special interface, `java.io.Serializable`, to be serializable. Its definition is as follows:

```java
public interface Serializable {
}
```

The `Serializable` interface does not define any methods; it's an empty interface. We refer to such empty interfaces as "marker interfaces" (`Marker Interface`). A class that implements a marker interface is merely tagging itself, without adding any methods.
