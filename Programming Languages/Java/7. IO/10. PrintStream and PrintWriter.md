PrintStream is a type of FilterOutputStream that offers additional methods on top of the OutputStream interface for writing various data types:

- Write int: `print(int)`
- Write boolean: `print(boolean)`
- Write String: `print(String)`
- Write Object: `print(Object)`, which is essentially equivalent to `print(object.toString())`
- ...
- And a corresponding set of `println()` methods that automatically append a newline character.

The frequently used `System.out.println()` is actually employing PrintStream to print various data. `System.out` is a system-provided default PrintStream representing standard output:

```java
System.out.print(12345); // Outputs 12345
System.out.print(new Object()); // Outputs something like java.lang.Object@3c7a835a
System.out.println("Hello"); // Outputs Hello followed by a newline
```
`System.err` is the system-provided standard error output.

Compared to OutputStream, PrintStream has the added convenience of a set of `print()/println()` methods for printing various data types. Additionally, it has the advantage of not throwing IOExceptions, which means that when writing code, catching IOExceptions is unnecessary.

**PrintWriter**

PrintStream ultimately outputs byte data, while PrintWriter extends the Writer interface, with its `print()/println()` methods ultimately outputting char data. Their usage is almost identical:

```java
import java.io.*;
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        StringWriter buffer = new StringWriter();
        try (PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(buffer)) {
            pw.println("Hello");
            pw.println(12345);
            pw.println(true);
        }
        System.out.println(buffer.toString());
    }
}
```
