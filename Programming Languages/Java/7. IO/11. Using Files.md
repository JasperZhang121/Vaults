Starting from Java 7, the utility class `Files` has been provided, greatly facilitating our file reading and writing tasks.

Even though `Files` belongs to the `java.nio` package, it encapsulates many simple methods for file operations. For instance, to read the entire content of a file into a `byte[]`, you can do as follows:

```java
byte[] data = Files.readAllBytes(Path.of("/path/to/file.txt"));
```

For text files, you can read the entire content into a `String`:

```java
// Reads using UTF-8 encoding by default:
String content1 = Files.readString(Path.of("/path/to/file.txt"));
// Specifies encoding:
String content2 = Files.readString(Path.of("/path", "to", "file.txt"), StandardCharsets.ISO_8859_1);
// Reads lines and returns the content of each line:
List<String> lines = Files.readAllLines(Path.of("/path/to/file.txt"));
```

Writing to files is also very convenient:

```java
// Writes binary files:
byte[] data = ...
Files.write(Path.of("/path/to/file.txt"), data);
// Writes text with specified encoding:
Files.writeString(Path.of("/path/to/file.txt"), "Text content...", StandardCharsets.ISO_8859_1);
// Writes text by lines:
List<String> lines = ...
Files.write(Path.of("/path/to/file.txt"), lines);
```

In addition, the `Files` utility class provides quick methods such as `copy()`, `delete()`, `exists()`, and `move()` for manipulating files and directories.

It's particularly important to note that the reading and writing methods provided by `Files` are subject to memory limitations and can only handle small files, such as configuration files, etc. It's not advisable to read or write large files, such as those of several GBs, in one go. For large files, it's still necessary to use file streams, reading or writing a portion of the file content at a time.
