Reader is an InputStream with an encoding converter that converts bytes into characters, while Writer is an OutputStream with an encoding converter that converts characters into bytes and outputs them.

The differences between Writer and OutputStream are as follows:

| OutputStream            | Writer               |
| ----------------------- | -------------------- |
| Byte stream, by byte    | Character stream, by char |
| Write byte (0~255): `void write(int b)` | Write character (0~65535): `void write(int c)` |
| Write byte array: `void write(byte[] b)` | Write char array: `void write(char[] c)` |
| No corresponding method | Write String: `void write(String s)` |

Writer is the superclass of all character output streams. Its main methods are:

- Write a single character (0~65535): `void write(int c)`;
- Write all characters from a char array: `void write(char[] c)`;
- Write all characters from a String: `void write(String s)`.

**FileWriter**

`FileWriter` is a `Writer` that writes character streams to files. Its usage is similar to `FileReader`:

```java
try (Writer writer = new FileWriter("readme.txt", StandardCharsets.UTF_8)) {
    writer.write('H'); // Write a single character
    writer.write("Hello".toCharArray()); // Write char[]
    writer.write("Hello"); // Write String
}
```

**CharArrayWriter**

`CharArrayWriter` can create a `Writer` in memory, serving essentially to construct a buffer where chars can be written, eventually producing a char[] array with the written chars, similar to `ByteArrayOutputStream`:

```java
try (CharArrayWriter writer = new CharArrayWriter()) {
    writer.write(65);
    writer.write(66);
    writer.write(67);
    char[] data = writer.toCharArray(); // { 'A', 'B', 'C' }
}
```

**StringWriter**

`StringWriter` is also a memory-based `Writer`, similar to `CharArrayWriter`. In fact, `StringWriter` internally maintains a `StringBuffer` and provides a `Writer` interface to the outside.

**OutputStreamWriter**

Besides `CharArrayWriter` and `StringWriter`, ordinary `Writers` are actually based on `OutputStream` construction. They accept chars, then internally automatically convert them into one or more bytes and write to `OutputStream`. Thus, `OutputStreamWriter` is a converter that turns any `OutputStream` into a `Writer`:

```java
try (Writer writer = new OutputStreamWriter(new FileOutputStream("readme.txt"), "UTF-8")) {
    // TODO:
}
```

The above code is essentially one way to implement `FileWriter`. This and the `InputStreamReader` from the previous section are similar.
