`InputStream` is the most fundamental input stream provided by Java's standard library, located in the `java.io` package, which offers all synchronous IO functionalities.

It's crucial to note that `InputStream` is not an interface but an abstract class, serving as the superclass for all input streams. The most important method defined in this abstract class is `int read()`, with the signature:

```java
public abstract int read() throws IOException;
```

This method reads the next byte of the input stream and returns its `int` value (0 to 255). If the end has been reached, it returns -1, indicating no more data can be read.

`FileInputStream` is a subclass of `InputStream`. As its name suggests, `FileInputStream` reads data from a file stream. The code below demonstrates how to completely read all bytes from a `FileInputStream`:

```java
public void readFile() throws IOException {
    // Create a FileInputStream object:
    InputStream input = new FileInputStream("src/readme.txt");
    for (;;) {
        int n = input.read(); // Repeatedly call read() method until it returns -1
        if (n == -1) {
            break;
        }
        System.out.println(n); // Print the byte value
    }
    input.close(); // Close the stream
}
```

Resources like files and network ports are managed by the operating system. Applications need to close resources like files after use to allow the OS to release them, failing which can lead to resource leaks, affecting other applications.

Both `InputStream` and `OutputStream` use the `close()` method to close streams, releasing underlying resources.

During IO operations, errors like file not existing or write permission failures might occur. The JVM wraps these low-level errors into `IOException` exceptions. Therefore, all IO-related code must correctly handle `IOException`.

A potential issue is that if an IO error occurs during reading, the `InputStream` may not close properly, leading to resource leakage.

Hence, it's necessary to use `try ... finally` to ensure that `InputStream` is correctly closed whether an IO error occurs or not:

```java
public void readFile() throws IOException {
    InputStream input = null;
    try {
        input = new FileInputStream("src/readme.txt");
        int n;
        while ((n = input.read()) != -1) { // Use while loop to read and check simultaneously
            System.out.println(n);
        }
    } finally {
        if (input != null) { input.close(); }
    }
}
```

Using `try ... finally` for the above code can seem complex. A better approach is to use Java 7's `try(resource)` syntax, which automatically closes the resource for us:

```java
public void readFile() throws IOException {
    try (InputStream input = new FileInputStream("src/readme.txt")) {
        int n;
        while ((n = input.read()) != -1) {
            System.out.println(n);
        }
    } // Compiler automatically inserts finally here and calls close()
}
```

The compiler doesn't specifically add automatic closing for `InputStream`. It checks if the object in `try(resource = ...)` implements `java.lang.AutoCloseable`. If it does, it automatically adds a `finally` statement and calls the `close()` method. Both `InputStream` and `OutputStream` implement this interface, so they can be used with `try(resource)`.

### Buffering

Reading a stream one byte at a time is not the most efficient method. <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Many streams support reading multiple bytes into a buffer in one go</mark>. For file and network streams, using a buffer to read multiple bytes at once is often much more efficient. `InputStream` provides two overloaded methods to support reading multiple bytes:

- `int read(byte[] b)`: Reads several bytes and fills the byte array, returning the number of bytes read.
- `int read(byte[] b, int off, int len)`: Specifies the byte array's offset and the maximum number to fill.

When using the above methods to read multiple bytes at a time, you need to define a `byte[]` array as a buffer. The `read()` method will try to read as many bytes as possible into the buffer but won't exceed the buffer's size. The return value of `read()` is no longer the byte's `int` value but the actual number of bytes read. If it returns -1, it means there's no more data.

The code for reading multiple bytes into a buffer is as follows:

```java
public void readFile() throws IOException {
    try (InputStream input = new FileInputStream("src/readme.txt")) {
        // Define a buffer with 1000 bytes size:
        byte[] buffer = new byte[1000];
        int n;
        while ((n = input.read(buffer)) != -1) { // Read into the buffer
           

 System.out.println("read " + n + " bytes.");
        }
    }
}
```

### Blocking

The `read()` method of `InputStream` is blocking. That means for the code:

```java
int n;
n = input.read(); // Must wait for read() method to return before executing the next line
int m = n;
```

When executing the second line of code, it must wait until the `read()` method returns before continuing. Since reading IO streams is much slower than executing regular code, it's unpredictable how long the `read()` method will take.

### InputStream Implementations

`FileInputStream` is a commonly used `InputStream` implementation class for obtaining input streams from files. Additionally, `ByteArrayInputStream` can simulate an `InputStream` in memory:

```java
import java.io.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        byte[] data = { 72, 101, 108, 108, 111, 33 };
        try (InputStream input = new ByteArrayInputStream(data)) {
            int n;
            while ((n = input.read()) != -1) {
                System.out.println((char)n);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

`ByteArrayInputStream` essentially turns a `byte[]` array in memory into an `InputStream`, which is not commonly used in practice but is useful for testing by constructing an `InputStream`.
