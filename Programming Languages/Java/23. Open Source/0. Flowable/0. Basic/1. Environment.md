Establishing a robust development environment is essential for effectively utilizing Flowable. This section outlines the necessary prerequisites and provides a step-by-step guide to installing Flowable, either integrated within a Spring Boot application or as a standalone engine.
### a. Prerequisites

Before setting up Flowable, ensure that your development environment meets the following requirements:

#### Java Development Kit (JDK)

- **Version Requirement**: JDK 8 or higher is mandatory.
- **Installation**:
  - **Windows/macOS**: Download the appropriate installer from the [Oracle JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) or [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/install/) websites.
  - **Linux**: Utilize package managers such as `apt` or `yum`. For example:
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk
    ```
- **Verification**:
  ```bash
  java -version
```

Ensure the output reflects the installed JDK version.

#### Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

Select a Java IDE that supports efficient development and integration with Flowable:

- **IntelliJ IDEA**: Renowned for its advanced features and seamless Spring Boot integration.
- **Eclipse**: Offers robust plugin support and is widely used in enterprise environments.
- **Alternative IDEs**: Visual Studio Code with Java extensions, NetBeans, etc., can also be utilized based on personal preference.

#### Build Automation Tools: Maven or Gradle

These tools manage project dependencies and streamline the build process:

- **Maven**:
    - **Installation**: Download from the [Maven website](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) and follow the installation instructions.
    - **Configuration**: Set the `M2_HOME` environment variable and add `MAVEN_HOME/bin` to the `PATH`.
- **Gradle**:
    - **Installation**: Available via [Gradle's official site](https://gradle.org/install/) or through package managers.
    - **Configuration**: Similar to Maven, set the appropriate environment variables and update the `PATH`.

#### Git

Version control is critical for managing codebases and collaborating within teams:

- **Installation**:
    - **Windows/macOS**: Download from the [Git website](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and follow the installer prompts.
    - **Linux**:
        
        ```bash
        sudo apt update
        sudo apt install git
        ```
        
- **Configuration**:
    
    ```bash
    git config --global user.name "Your Name"
    git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
    ```
    

### b. Install Flowable

Flowable can be integrated into your development workflow either as part of a Spring Boot application or as a standalone BPM engine. This section outlines both approaches.

#### Integration with Spring Boot

Integrating Flowable with Spring Boot leverages Spring's capabilities for streamlined configuration and dependency management.

##### 1. Create a Spring Boot Project

- **Using Spring Initializr**:
    - Navigate to [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/).
    - **Project Metadata**:
        - **Project**: Maven Project or Gradle Project.
        - **Language**: Java.
        - **Spring Boot**: Select the latest stable version.
        - **Project Metadata**: Fill in Group, Artifact, Name, and other relevant fields.
    - **Dependencies**:
        - **Spring Web**: Facilitates building web applications.
        - **Spring Data JPA**: Provides JPA-based data access.
        - **Additional Dependencies**: Depending on project requirements (e.g., Spring Security).
    - **Generate**: Click on the "Generate" button to download the project scaffold.

##### 2. Add Flowable Dependencies

Incorporate Flowable into your Spring Boot project by adding the necessary dependencies.

- **For Maven**:
    
    ```xml
    <dependencies>
        <!-- Other dependencies -->
        
        <!-- Flowable Spring Boot Starter for Processes -->
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.flowable</groupId>
            <artifactId>flowable-spring-boot-starter-process</artifactId>
            <version>7.2.0</version> <!-- Verify the latest version -->
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
    ```
    
- **For Gradle**:
    
    ```gradle
    dependencies {
        // Other dependencies
        
        // Flowable Spring Boot Starter for Processes
        implementation 'org.flowable:flowable-spring-boot-starter-process:7.2.0' // Verify the latest version
    }
    ```
    
- **Update Dependencies**:
    - **Maven**:
        
        ```bash
        mvn clean install
        ```
        
    - **Gradle**:
        
        ```bash
        gradle build
        ```

##### 3. Configure Application Properties

Configure Flowable settings within your `application.properties` or `application.yml` file.

```properties
# application.properties

# Flowable Database Configuration
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:flowable;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1
spring.datasource.username=sa
spring.datasource.password=
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=org.h2.Driver

# Flowable Engine Configuration
flowable.id-generator.datasource=jdbc/h2
flowable.database-schema-update=true
```

#### Standalone Flowable Engine

Alternatively, Flowable can be run as a standalone BPM engine, independent of any specific application framework.

##### 1. Download Flowable Distribution

- **Source**: Access the latest Flowable distribution from the [Flowable GitHub Releases](https://github.com/flowable/flowable-engine/releases).
- **Download**: Select the appropriate distribution package (e.g., ZIP or TAR.GZ).

##### 2. Extract the Distribution Package

- **Extraction**:
    - **Windows**: Use tools like WinRAR or 7-Zip.
    - **macOS/Linux**:
        
        ```bash
        tar -xzf flowable-7.x.x.zip
        ```
        
- **Directory Structure**: Familiarize yourself with the extracted directories, typically including:
    - **`lib/`**: Contains Flowable libraries.
    - **`conf/`**: Configuration files.
    - **`webapps/`**: Web applications for process management.

##### 3. Follow the Flowable Setup Guide

- **Configuration**:
    - Modify configuration files located in the `conf/` directory as needed (e.g., database settings).
- **Database Setup**:
    - Ensure that the chosen database is accessible and properly configured.
- **Starting Flowable**:
    - Navigate to the Flowable directory and execute the startup script:
        - **Windows**:
            
            ```bash
            ./flowable.bat
            ```
            
        - **macOS/Linux**:
            
            ```bash
            ./flowable.sh
            ```
            
- **Accessing Flowable**:
    - Once started, Flowable's web applications (such as Flowable Task and Flowable Admin) can be accessed via a web browser at `http://localhost:8080/flowable-task` or the designated port.
