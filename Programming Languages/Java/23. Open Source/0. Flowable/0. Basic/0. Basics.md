### Key Concepts to Grasp

A comprehensive understanding of Flowable necessitates familiarity with several foundational concepts integral to business process management.

#### BPMN 2.0

BPMN 2.0 is the prevailing standard for business process modeling. It provides a graphical notation that enables the representation of complex business workflows in a standardized manner, facilitating clear communication among stakeholders and serving as a blueprint for process automation.

**Components of BPMN 2.0:**

- **Flow Objects:** Core elements including <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">events, activities, and gateways</mark>.
- **Connecting Objects:** Sequence flows, message flows, and associations that define relationships.
- **Swimlanes:** Pools and lanes that organize activities by participant or function.
- **Artifacts:** Data objects, groups, and <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">annotations</mark> that provide additional context.

#### Processes

In Flowable, a process represents a structured sequence of activities designed to achieve specific business objectives. Processes model the workflows that automate tasks, decisions, and interactions within an organization.

**Characteristics of Processes:**

- **Lifecycle:** Initiation, execution, and completion phases.
- **Participants:** Roles and resources involved in the process.
- **Dependencies:** Interactions and dependencies between tasks and activities.

#### Tasks

Tasks are the fundamental units of work within a process. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Each task encapsulates a single activity that contributes to the overall workflow</mark>, such as data entry, approvals, or automated operations.

**Types of Tasks:**

- **User Tasks:** Require <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">human intervention or input</mark>.
- **Service Tasks:** Automated tasks <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">performed by the system</mark>.
- **Script Tasks:** <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Execute scripts or code snippets</mark> as part of the workflow.

#### Flows

Flows define the progression of a process by establishing the sequence and conditions under which activities are executed. They govern the transition from one task to another, ensuring the orderly execution of the process.

**Types of Flows:**

- **Sequence Flows:** Indicate the <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">order of task execution</mark>.
- **Conditional Flows:** <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Direct the process</mark> based on specific conditions or criteria.
- **Message Flows:** Represent <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">communication</mark> between different process participants.

#### Events

Events are triggers that initiate, interrupt, or conclude processes. They play a crucial role in managing the dynamic aspects of workflows by responding to specific occurrences.

**Categories of Events:**

- **Start Events:** Initiate the commencement of a process.
- **End Events:** Mark the termination of a process.
- **Intermediate Events:** Occur during the execution of a process to handle exceptions or alternate paths.

#### Gateways

Gateways serve as decision points within a process, determining the subsequent path based on defined conditions or rules. They enable the branching, merging, and synchronization of process flows.

**Types of Gateways:**

- **Exclusive Gateways:** Allow <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">only one outgoing</mark> path based on conditions.
- **Parallel Gateways:** Enable <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">simultaneous</mark> execution of multiple paths.
- **Inclusive Gateways:** <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Permit one or more</mark> outgoing paths based on conditions.
