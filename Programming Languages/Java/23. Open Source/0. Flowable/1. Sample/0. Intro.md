### Overview

This document outlines a Flowable BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) workflow designed to process leave (holiday) requests. The workflow incorporates managerial approval and follows different execution paths based on the decision.

Flowable is a lightweight BPMN engine that automates business processes. In this example, the workflow defines a leave request handling process, including user tasks, decision gateways, and service tasks.

### Process Flow

```
START 
  --> [Manager Review (User Task)] 
    --> [Decision (Gateway)]
              |
    +---------+-------------------------+
    |                                   |
 [Approved]                      [Not Approved]
    |                                   |
 [Process Approval]             [Process Rejection]  
 (Service Task)                   (Service Task)
    |                                   |
 [Notify Employee]                 REJECT END
 (User Task: Employee)
    |
 APPROVE END
```

### Flow Explanation
1.	START: The process begins when an employee submits a leave request.
2.	Manager Review (User Task): Managers review the request and either approve or reject it.
3.	Decision Gateway:
	•	If approved, the process moves to approval processing.
	•	If rejected, the process follows the rejection path.
4.	Process Approval (Service Task): Automates actions like notifying HR or updating the leave database.
5.	Notify Employee (User Task): The employee is informed of the approval decision.
6.	APPROVE END: The process completes after approval.
7.	Process Rejection (Service Task): Logs the rejection or notifies the employee.
8.	REJECT END: The process terminates after rejection.

### Flowable Implementation
1.	BPMN Model: Defined using a BPMN XML file and deployed to the Flowable engine.
2.	User Tasks: Flowable assigns tasks like manager approval and employee notification.
3.	Decision Gateway: Routes the process based on the manager’s decision.
4.	Service Tasks: Automates actions such as sending notifications or updating records.
5.	Process Execution:
	•	Flowable manages task assignments, tracks process state, and ensures correct transitions.
	•	Developers interact with the Flowable API to retrieve tasks, complete approvals, and trigger next steps programmatically.
