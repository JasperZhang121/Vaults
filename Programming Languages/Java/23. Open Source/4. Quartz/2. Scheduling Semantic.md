### `SimpleTrigger` vs. `CronTrigger`
- **`SimpleTrigger`**:  
  `startAt`, optional `endAt`, `withIntervalInSeconds|Minutes|Hours`, `withRepeatCount`.  
  Use for fixed interval tasks (e.g., every 30s, repeat 120 times).
- **`CronTrigger`**:  
  Cron grammar: `sec min hour dayOfMonth month dayOfWeek [year]`.  
  Examples:  
  - Every 5 minutes: `0 0/5 * * * ?`  
  - Daily at 02:00: `0 0 2 * * ?`  
  - Mondays at 09:30: `0 30 9 ? * MON`
  Cron is ideal for business-aligned schedules (specific weekdays/hours).

### Misfire (Missed Fire Time) Handling
A **misfire** occurs when a trigger’s scheduled time has passed without execution (e.g., the app was down, or a prior run overlapped). Quartz provides **misfire instructions** to define deterministic behavior:

- **For `SimpleTrigger`** (examples via `SimpleScheduleBuilder`):
  - `withMisfireHandlingInstructionFireNow()` — fire once now, then continue.
  - `withMisfireHandlingInstructionNextWithRemainingCount()` — skip missed times; continue with remaining count.
  - `withMisfireHandlingInstructionIgnoreMisfires()` — attempt to catch up aggressively (use with care).
- **For `CronTrigger`** (via `CronScheduleBuilder`):
  - `withMisfireHandlingInstructionDoNothing()` — skip missed executions; resume on the next scheduled time.
  - `withMisfireHandlingInstructionFireAndProceed()` — fire once immediately, then continue the normal schedule.
  - `withMisfireHandlingInstructionIgnoreMisfires()` — attempt to catch up.

**Guidance**
- Define misfire behavior **explicitly** to match business semantics:
  - Financial batch might **catch up**; monitoring pings can often **skip**.
- Monitor misfire counts; frequent misfires indicate underprovisioning or too-tight intervals.

### Time Zones and DST
- Cron schedules can specify a **time zone**: align jobs with local business hours across deployments.
- Daylight Saving Time (DST) adds edge cases (e.g., 02:30 may not exist). Favor robust testing around transitions; consider fixed UTC with domain-level conversions if appropriate.

### Calendars (Business Windows)
- Use Quartz **Calendars** to exclude periods (weekends, holidays, maintenance windows).
- Combine with cron: cron defines the nominal times; calendars *subtract* forbidden windows, yielding effective fire times.

### Priorities, Pausing, and Resuming
- Triggers have **priorities**; when multiple are due, higher priority is scheduled first.
- You can pause/resume triggers or jobs (or whole groups) for operational control, e.g., during outages or releases.
