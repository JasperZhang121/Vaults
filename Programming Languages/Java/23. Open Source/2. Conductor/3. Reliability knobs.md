### Retries (per task type)

Configure retries **in the task definition**—not in the workflow step—so every use of the task type behaves consistently.

Key fields:

- `retryCount` — max attempts after the first failure (default **3**, capped at **10**). ([Conductor OSS](https://conductor-oss.github.io/conductor/documentation/configuration/taskdef.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Task Definition - Conductor Documentation"))
    
- `retryDelaySeconds` — base delay between attempts. ([Conductor OSS](https://conductor-oss.github.io/conductor/documentation/configuration/taskdef.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Task Definition - Conductor Documentation"))
    
- `retryLogic` — backoff strategy:
    
    - `FIXED` → wait exactly `retryDelaySeconds`.
        
    - `LINEAR_BACKOFF` → wait `retryDelaySeconds * backoffRate * attemptNumber`.
        
    - `EXPONENTIAL_BACKOFF` → wait `retryDelaySeconds * (2 ^ attemptNumber)` (or using the provider’s factor). ([Conductor OSS](https://conductor-oss.github.io/conductor/documentation/configuration/taskdef.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Task Definition - Conductor Documentation"))
        

**Example (task definition)**

```json
{
  "name": "charge_payment",
  "retryCount": 5,
  "retryDelaySeconds": 10,
  "retryLogic": "EXPONENTIAL_BACKOFF",
  "ownerEmail": "payments@acme.com"
}
```

> Practical tip: keep workers **idempotent**, since a retry may re-hit external systems. (Conductor will re-schedule failed tasks based on the strategy above.)

### Timeouts (fail fast, or keep alive)

Conductor has multiple timeout controls; use them together:

- **`timeoutSeconds`** — max wall-clock time a task may stay **IN_PROGRESS** before Conductor marks it **TIMED_OUT** (0 = disabled). ([Conductor OSS](https://conductor-oss.github.io/conductor/documentation/configuration/taskdef.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Task Definition - Conductor Documentation"))
    
- **`responseTimeoutSeconds`** — **heartbeat** deadline: once a worker polls a task, it must report a status within this time or Conductor marks it **TIMED_OUT** (protects against crashed workers). ([Conductor OSS](https://conductor-oss.github.io/conductor/devguide/architecture/tasklifecycle.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Task Lifecycle - Conductor Documentation"))
    
- **`timeoutPolicy`** — what to do on timeout:
    
    - `RETRY` (try again),
        
    - `ALERT_ONLY` (metric only),
        
    - `TIME_OUT_WF` (default; **terminates the workflow as TIMED_OUT**). ([Conductor OSS](https://conductor-oss.github.io/conductor/documentation/configuration/taskdef.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Task Definition - Conductor Documentation"))
        

(There’s also `pollTimeoutSeconds` to time out tasks that **never get polled**—handy for ensuring capacity is actually available.) ([Conductor OSS](https://conductor-oss.github.io/conductor/documentation/configuration/taskdef.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Task Definition - Conductor Documentation"))

**Example (timeouts + policy)**

```json
{
  "name": "charge_payment",
  "timeoutSeconds": 120,
  "responseTimeoutSeconds": 30,
  "timeoutPolicy": "RETRY"
}
```

---

### Throughput controls: rate vs. concurrency (they’re different)

- **`concurrentExecLimit`** — a **cap on simultaneous executions** of this task type cluster-wide. If set to 10, only 10 instances run at once, even if thousands are queued and many workers are polling. (New ones are released as running ones finish.) ([Conductor OSS](https://conductor-oss.github.io/conductor/documentation/configuration/taskdef.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Task Definition - Conductor Documentation"))
    
- **`rateLimitFrequencyInSeconds` + `rateLimitPerFrequency`** — a **dispatch rate** throttle. Example: `5s` window with `12` per window = **144 tasks/min**, regardless of how fast workers finish. (Rate limit is independent of how many are already in progress.) _Note:_ OSS rate limiting is supported with the **Redis** persistence module. ([Conductor OSS](https://conductor-oss.github.io/conductor/documentation/configuration/taskdef.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Task Definition - Conductor Documentation"))
    

**Example (both applied)**

```json
{
  "name": "charge_payment",
  "concurrentExecLimit": 20,
  "rateLimitFrequencyInSeconds": 5,
  "rateLimitPerFrequency": 12
}
```

> In managed Orkes Conductor you’ll also see **workflow-level rate limits** (cap concurrent workflow executions); tasks beyond the cap start with their first step pending. ([Orkes](https://orkes.io/content/rate-limits?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Rate Limits | Orkes Conductor Documentation"))

---

### Failure workflows (compensation)

At the **workflow** level, attach a **compensation flow** that runs automatically if the main workflow fails:

```json
{
  "name": "order_fulfillment",
  "version": 1,
  "failureWorkflow": "order_compensation"
}
```

When triggered, the failure workflow receives the original input plus context such as `workflowId`, `reason`, and the failed task ID/status—use these to **undo side-effects** (e.g., refund, release inventory, send alerts). ([Conductor OSS](https://conductor-oss.github.io/conductor/devguide/how-tos/Workflows/handling-errors.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Handling Workflow Errors - Conductor Documentation"))

---

### Putting it together (cheat sheet)

- **Transient errors** → raise `retryCount`, pick `EXPONENTIAL_BACKOFF`, and keep `timeoutSeconds` generous; use `responseTimeoutSeconds` to detect dead workers. ([Conductor OSS](https://conductor-oss.github.io/conductor/documentation/configuration/taskdef.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Task Definition - Conductor Documentation"))
    
- **Hot paths** → use `concurrentExecLimit` to protect downstreams; add **rate limits** to smooth spikes (remember Redis caveat in OSS). ([Conductor OSS](https://conductor-oss.github.io/conductor/documentation/configuration/taskdef.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Task Definition - Conductor Documentation"))
    
- **Critical flows** → set `timeoutPolicy` explicitly; wire a `failureWorkflow` for compensations and ops visibility. ([Conductor OSS](https://conductor-oss.github.io/conductor/documentation/configuration/taskdef.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Task Definition - Conductor Documentation"))
