### Concept
Domain-Driven Design (abbreviated as DDD) is a software development methodology and architectural concept. It aims to handle the construction of software systems in complex business scenarios by focusing the core attention on the business domain. It emphasizes starting from the perspective of business domain experts, deeply understanding the rules, processes, entities in the business domain and the relationships among them, and then designing the architecture and implementation of the software system based on this understanding, so that the software model can accurately reflect the actual situation of the business domain and improve the maintainability, extensibility and alignment with the business of the software.

#### Main Layers
- **Domain Layer**: This is the core of the entire DDD architecture, containing the core concepts in the business domain, such as <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Entities, Value Objects, Domain Services, Aggregates and Domain Events</mark>. An entity has a unique identifier and its state can change over time; a value object determines equality through its attribute values and has no unique identifier; a domain service is used to handle business logic that spans entities or cannot be attributed to the behavior of a single entity; an aggregate is a collection of related objects, with a root entity coordinating access to other objects within the aggregate; a domain event is used to convey important messages about changes in business status within the domain.
- **Application Layer**: It plays a role of connecting the preceding and the following. It is mainly responsible for coordinating the <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">interaction between the domain layer and the infrastructure layer</mark>, orchestrating the calling sequence of the business logic of domain objects, and providing application service interfaces externally for external clients (such as user interfaces, API calls from other systems, etc.) to trigger business processes. It itself does not contain specific details of business logic.
- **Infrastructure Layer**: It provides technical support for the entire system, such as <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">database access, integration of message queues, implementation of cache mechanisms</mark>, etc. It implements the underlying technical details on which the domain layer and the application layer depend. Through the principle of dependency inversion, the domain layer and the application layer define interfaces, and the infrastructure layer provides specific implementations, which makes it convenient to replace different specific technical implementations without affecting the upper-layer business logic.

#### Advantages
- **Alignment with Business**: Since it is built closely around the business domain, the software can better reflect the real business requirements and reduce development errors caused by misunderstandings of the business.
- **High Maintainability**: When the business changes, based on the clear domain division and layered architecture, it is easier to locate the positions of the code that needs to be modified and make corresponding adjustments and extensions.
- **Team Collaboration Friendly**: Domain experts can communicate more effectively with developers because everyone focuses on a unified business domain model. Developers can better understand business requirements and complete development work in their respective positions.

### Java Examples Demonstrating DDD Architecture

The following takes the function of "order processing" in a simple e-commerce system as an example to show the implementation of the DDD architecture.

#### 1. Domain Layer
- **Example of Entity: Order Entity**
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class Order {
    private String orderId; // Unique identifier of the order
    private Customer customer; // Associated customer entity
    private List<OrderItem> orderItems = new ArrayList<>(); // List of order item details
    private OrderStatus status; // Order status (such as created, paid, shipped, etc.)

    // Constructor, Getter and Setter methods are omitted.

    public void addOrderItem(OrderItem item) {
        orderItems.add(item);
    }

    public double calculateTotalPrice() {
        double total = 0;
        for (OrderItem item : orderItems) {
        total += item.getProduct().getPrice() * item.getQuantity();
        }
        return total;
    }

    public void changeStatus(OrderStatus newStatus) {
        this.status = newStatus;
        // Domain events can be triggered here, for example, an order status change event.
        DomainEventPublisher.publish(new OrderStatusChangedEvent(this));
    }
}
```
The `Order` entity here has its own unique identifier `orderId`, contains attributes such as associated customer information, a list of order item details and the order status, and has behavioral methods such as adding order item details, calculating the total price and changing the order status. When the status is changed, corresponding domain events can also be triggered.

- **Example of Value Object: Address Value Object**
```java
public class Address {
    private String street;
    private String city;
    private String postalCode;

    // Constructor, Getter and Setter methods are omitted.

    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object o) {
        if (this == o) return true;
        if (o == null || getClass()!= o.getClass()) return false;
        Address address = (Address) o;
        return Objects.equals(street, address.street) &&
                Objects.equals(city, address.city) &&
                Objects.equals(postalCode, address.postalCode);
    }

    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        return Objects.hash(street, city, postalCode);
    }
}
```
The `Address` value object determines equality through its attributes such as street, city and postal code. It does not have a unique identifier like an entity and is mainly used to represent some immutable concepts that are judged equal by value, such as the shipping address of a customer.

- **Example of Domain Service: PaymentService**
```java
public class PaymentService {
    public boolean processPayment(Order order, PaymentMethod paymentMethod) {
        // Specific payment logic implementation such as calling the interface of a third-party payment platform can be done here.
        if (paymentMethod.isValid()) {
            // Assume the payment is successful logic.
            order.changeStatus(OrderStatus.PAID);
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```
The `PaymentService` domain service is used to handle the business logic of order payment. It needs to operate on the order entity to change its status and verify the payment method, etc. This logic is not suitable to be placed inside a single entity, so it exists as a domain service, coordinating multiple related entities and external resources (such as the interface of the payment platform) to complete the payment business process.

- **Example of Aggregate: Aggregate with Order as the Aggregate Root**
`Order` serves as the aggregate root, which is responsible for coordinating and managing other objects within the aggregate, such as `OrderItem` (order item details) and the associated `Customer` (customer) information. External access to the objects within the aggregate should be carried out through the aggregate root `Order`, which can ensure the consistency of the data within the aggregate and the integrity of the business rules. For example, to add an order item detail, it should be done through the `addOrderItem` method of the `Order` entity instead of directly operating on the `OrderItem` list.

#### 2. Application Layer
**Example of Application Service: OrderApplicationService**
```java
public class OrderApplicationService {
    private OrderRepository orderRepository; // Obtain the order repository implementation through dependency injection.
    private PaymentService paymentService; // Obtain the payment service through dependency injection.

    public Order createOrder(Customer customer, List<Product> products) {
        Order order = new Order(customer);
        for (Product product : products) {
            OrderItem item = new OrderItem(product, 1); // Assume the quantity is 1, which can actually be passed in according to the business.
            order.addOrderItem(item);
        }
        order.changeStatus(OrderStatus.CREATED);
        orderRepository.save(order); // Call the repository to save the order to the database.
        return order;
    }

    public boolean payForOrder(String orderId, PaymentMethod paymentMethod) {
        Order order = orderRepository.findById(orderId);
        if (order!= null) {
            return paymentService.processPayment(order, paymentMethod);
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```
The `OrderApplicationService` application service coordinates various objects in the domain layer to complete specific business processes. For example, when creating an order, it will create an `Order` entity, add order item details, set the initial status and then call the method of the repository layer to save the order to the database. In the process of paying for an order, it first obtains the order from the repository and then calls the payment service to handle the payment logic. It plays the role of orchestrating external requests into operations in the domain layer and does not itself contain the implementation details of specific business logic (the specific business logic is in the various objects in the domain layer).

#### 3. Infrastructure Layer
**Example of Repository Implementation: OrderRepository**
```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class OrderRepository {
    private Map<String, Order> orderMap = new HashMap<>(); // Simply simulate database storage, and in actuality, it will be database operations.

    public void save(Order order) {
        orderMap.put(order.getOrderId(), order);
    }

    public Order findById(String orderId) {
        return orderMap.get(orderId);
    }
}
```
The `OrderRepository` is the implementation of the persistence operation of the `Order` entity data in the domain layer in the infrastructure layer. Here, a `Map` is simply used to simulate database storage. In actual development, frameworks such as JDBC, MyBatis, Hibernate will be used to implement the interaction with the actual database (such as MySQL, Oracle, etc.) to concretely implement operations such as saving and querying order data. Through the principle of dependency inversion, the domain layer defines the interface specification of the `OrderRepository`, and the infrastructure layer provides the specific implementation class, which makes it convenient to replace different database technical implementations without affecting the upper-layer business logic and domain model.

Through such a simple Java example, the application of the DDD architecture in the order processing function of an e-commerce system is demonstrated. From the definition of the core business domain concepts in the domain layer, to the orchestration and coordination of business processes in the application layer, and then to the support and implementation of the underlying technical details in the infrastructure layer, each layer has a clear division of labor and jointly constructs a software architecture that is aligned with the business, easy to maintain and extend.
