### Existing Problems

> - Each database operation requires a new connection, and after use, the connection is closed, causing resource wastage due to frequent creation and destruction.
> - The number of connections is uncontrollable, putting tremendous pressure on the server.

### Connection Pool

> A connection pool is a buffer area for database connection objects, managed by the pool through configuration, responsible for creating, managing, and releasing connections.
>
> The pool pre-creates database connections and stores them in the pool. When users request connections, they obtain them directly from the pool, and after use, they return the connections to the pool, avoiding frequent creation and destruction and solving efficiency issues.
>
> When there are no available connections in the pool and the maximum limit has not been reached, the pool will create new connections.
>
> When the pool reaches the maximum limit, user requests will wait, and a timeout can be set.

### Common Connection Pools

The JDBC database connection pool uses the javax.sql.DataSource interface for standardization. All third-party connection pools implement this interface and add specific implementations! This means that the methods for obtaining connections and recycling connections are the same for all connection pools, with differences only in performance and additional features.

- DBCP is a database connection pool provided by Apache. It is faster than C3P0 but has some bugs.
- C3P0 is a database connection pool provided by an open-source organization. It is slower but stable.
- Proxool is an open-source project database connection pool under sourceforge, featuring connection pool state monitoring. Its stability is slightly inferior to C3P0.
- **Druid is a database connection pool provided by Alibaba, combining the advantages of DBCP, C3P0, and Proxool. It has better performance, scalability, and usability, offering rich features**.
- **Hikari (ひかりcomes from Japanese, meaning light. It is a connection pool built into SpringBoot 2.x, based on improvements and optimizations of BoneCP (maintenance has been discontinued, and this pool is recommended). Its slogan is fast, simple, and reliable.**


### Using Druid Connection Pool

- Usage steps:
  - Include the jar package.
  - Write code.

- Code implementation:

  - Hard-coded method (for understanding):

```java
      @Test
	  public void testHardCodeDruid() throws SQLException {
		  /*
			  Hard coding: Coupling the connection pool configuration information with the Java code.
			  1. Create a DruidDataSource connection pool object.
			  2. Set the necessary and optional configuration information for the connection pool.
			  3. Obtain a connection object from the pool.
			  4. Recycle the connection [not releasing the connection, but returning it to the pool for reuse by other threads].
		   */
  
		  //1. Create a DruidDataSource connection pool object.
		  DruidDataSource druidDataSource = new DruidDataSource();
  
		  //2. Set the necessary and optional configuration information for the connection pool.
		  //2.1 Necessary configuration
		  druidDataSource.setDriverClassName("com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver");
		  druidDataSource.setUrl("jdbc:mysql:///a");
		  druidDataSource.setUsername("root");
		  druidDataSource.setPassword("a");
  
		  //2.2 Optional configuration
		  druidDataSource.setInitialSize(10);
		  druidDataSource.setMaxActive(20);
		  
		  //3. Obtain a connection object from the pool.
		  Connection connection = druidDataSource.getConnection();
		  System.out.println(connection);
  
		  //Perform CRUD based on connection


  
		  //4. Recycle the connection
		  connection.close();
	  }
```
  
  - Soft-coded method (recommended):
  
    - Create a resources folder in the project directory, mark the folder as a resource directory, and create a db.properties configuration file to define the connection information in this file.
  
```
    properties
	# Configuration parameters needed for the druid connection pool, with fixed key names
	driverClassName=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
	url=jdbc:mysql:///a
	username=root
	password=a
	initialSize=10
	maxActive=20
```
  
    - Java code:

```java
	@Test
	public void testResourcesDruid() throws Exception {
		//1. Create a Properties collection to store the key and value pairs from the external configuration file.
		Properties properties = new Properties();

		//2. Read the external configuration file to obtain the input stream and load it into the Properties collection.
		InputStream inputStream = DruidTest.class.getClassLoader().getResourceAsStream("db.properties");
		properties.load(inputStream);

		//3. Build a DruidDataSource connection pool based on the Properties collection.
		DataSource dataSource = DruidDataSourceFactory.createDataSource(properties);

		//4. Obtain a connection object from the pool.
		Connection connection = dataSource.getConnection();
		System.out.println(connection);

		//5. Perform CRUD

		//6. Recycle the connection
		connection.close();
	}
```


### Other Druid Configurations

| name                          |             | Configuring this property makes sense because if there are multiple data sources, they can be distinguished by name when monitoring. If not configured, a name will be generated in the format: "DataSource-" + System.identityHashCode(this)                                                              |
| jdbcUrl                       |             | The URL to connect to the database, which varies with the database.

| username                      |             | Username to connect to the database                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| password                      |             | Password to connect to the database. If you do not want to directly write the password in the configuration file, you can use the ConfigFilter. See here for details: <https://github.com/alibaba/druid/wiki/Using-ConfigFilter>                                                                           |
| driverClassName               |             | Automatically recognized based on the URL. This item can be configured or not configured. If not configured, druid will automatically recognize the dbType based on the URL and then select the appropriate driverClassName (it is recommended to configure it)                                            |
| initialSize                   | 0           | The number of physical connections established during initialization. Initialization occurs when init is explicitly called, or when the first getConnection is called                                                                                                                                      |
| maxActive                     | 8           | Maximum number of connections in the pool                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| maxIdle                       | 8           | No longer used, configuring it has no effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| maxWait                       |             | The maximum milliseconds to wait for a connection from the pool. Configuring maxWait by default enables fair lock, which will reduce concurrency efficiency. If needed, you can configure the useUnfairLock attribute to true to use an unfair lock.                                                       |
| poolPreparedStatements        | false       | Whether to cache preparedStatement, also known as PSCache. PSCache greatly improves performance for databases that support cursors, like Oracle. It is recommended to close it under mysql.                                                                                                                |
| maxOpenPreparedStatements     | -1          | To enable PSCache, you must configure it to be greater than 0. When it is greater than 0, poolPreparedStatements is automatically triggered to change to true. In Druid, there is no problem of PSCache occupying too much memory under Oracle, so you can configure this number to be larger, such as 100 |
| validationQuery               |             | The SQL used to check if the connection is valid, which should be a query statement. If validationQuery is null, testOnBorrow, testOnReturn, and testWhileIdle will not take effect.                                                                                                                       |
| testOnBorrow                  | true        | When applying for a connection, execute validationQuery to check if the connection is valid. This configuration will reduce performance.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| testOnReturn                  | false       | Execute validationQuery to check if the connection is valid when returning the connection. This configuration will reduce performance.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| testWhileIdle                 | false       | It is recommended to configure it as true, which does not affect performance and ensures safety. When applying for a connection, check if the idle time is greater than timeBetweenEvictionRunsMillis. If it is, execute validationQuery to check if the connection is valid.                              |
| timeBetweenEvictionRunsMillis |             | It has two meanings: 1) The interval for the Destroy thread to check connections 2) The basis for the testWhileIdle decision, see the testWhileIdle property description for details                                                                                                                       |
