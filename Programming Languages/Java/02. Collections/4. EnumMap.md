Because a HashMap calculates the `hashCode()` of keys and uses a space-for-time method to directly locate the index of the value in its internal array, it has very high lookup efficiency.

If the objects used as keys are of an enum type, then you can use a special `EnumMap` provided by the Java Collections Framework. Internally, it stores values in <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">a very compact array</mark> and locates the index in the internal array directly based on the enum type of the key without needing to calculate `hashCode()`. This <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not only achieves the highest efficiency but also avoids extra space waste</mark>.

Let's take the `DayOfWeek` enum type as an example and create a "translation" feature for it:

```java
import java.time.DayOfWeek;
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Map<DayOfWeek, String> map = new EnumMap<>(DayOfWeek.class);
        map.put(DayOfWeek.MONDAY, "Monday");
        map.put(DayOfWeek.TUESDAY, "Tuesday");
        map.put(DayOfWeek.WEDNESDAY, "Wednesday");
        map.put(DayOfWeek.THURSDAY, "Thursday");
        map.put(DayOfWeek.FRIDAY, "Friday");
        map.put(DayOfWeek.SATURDAY, "Saturday");
        map.put(DayOfWeek.SUNDAY, "Sunday");
        System.out.println(map);
        System.out.println(map.get(DayOfWeek.MONDAY));
    }
}
```

When using `EnumMap`, we always refer to it using the `Map` interface. Therefore, swapping `HashMap` and `EnumMap` in client code makes no difference from the client's perspective.
