We know that a Queue is a first-in, first-out (FIFO) data structure, allowing insertion at one end and removal from the other.

If we relax this condition to allow insertion and removal at both ends, we get a Double Ended Queue, academically known as a Deque.

The Java Collections Framework provides the Deque interface to implement a double-ended queue, with capabilities such as:

- Adding elements to both the rear and the front of the queue.
- Retrieving elements from both the front and the rear of the queue.

Let's compare the methods for enqueuing and dequeuing in Queue and Deque:

| Action                | Queue                       | Deque                               |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Add element to rear   | add(E e) / offer(E e)       | addLast(E e) / offerLast(E e)       |
| Remove and return front element | remove() / poll()         | removeFirst() / pollFirst()         |
| Return front element without removing | element() / peek()        | getFirst() / peekFirst()            |
| Add element to front  | Not available               | addFirst(E e) / offerFirst(E e)     |
| Remove and return rear element | Not available               | removeLast() / pollLast()           |
| Return rear element without removing | Not available               | getLast() / peekLast()              |

For adding elements to the rear, Queue provides add()/offer() methods, while Deque provides addLast()/offerLast() methods. The operations of adding elements to the front and removing elements from the rear are not present in Queue but are provided in Deque by addFirst()/removeLast() and other similar methods.

It's worth noting that the Deque interface actually extends Queue:

```java
public interface Deque<E> extends Queue<E> {
    ...
}
```

Therefore, the add()/offer() methods provided by Queue are also available in Deque, but when using Deque, it's preferable not to call offer(), but rather offerLast():

```java
import java.util.Deque;
import java.util.LinkedList;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Deque<String> deque = new LinkedList<>();
        deque.offerLast("A"); // A
        deque.offerLast("B"); // A <- B
        deque.offerFirst("C"); // C <- A <- B
        System.out.println(deque.pollFirst()); // C, remaining A <- B
        System.out.println(deque.pollLast()); // B, remaining A
        System.out.println(deque.pollFirst()); // A
        System.out.println(deque.pollFirst()); // null
    }
}
```

Writing deque.offer() directly requires consideration, as offer() is actually offerLast(). Clearly writing offerLast() avoids confusion and clearly indicates that an element is being added to the rear.

Thus, when using Deque, it's recommended to always explicitly call offerLast()/offerFirst() or pollFirst()/pollLast() methods.

Deque is an interface implemented by classes like ArrayDeque and LinkedList.

It's evident that LinkedList is a versatile player; it serves as a List, a Queue, and a Deque. However, when using it, we always refer to it through a specific interface, signifying a higher level of abstraction in the code. The methods defined by the interface represent its intended use.

```java
// Not recommended:
LinkedList<String> d1 = new LinkedList<>();
d1.offerLast("z");
// Recommended:
Deque<String> d2 = new LinkedList<>();
d2.offerLast("z");
```

One principle of programming to an interface is: always hold onto the interface rather than the concrete implementation class.
