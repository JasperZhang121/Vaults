We know that a Queue is a First In First Out (FIFO) collection.

When conducting business at a bank counter, assuming there is only one counter in service but many people in line, how should it be managed?

Each person could take a number, such as A1, A2, A3, etc., and then be served in order according to their number. Essentially, this is a Queue.

However, if a VIP customer arrives with the number V1, even though the current queue is at A10, A11, A12, the next customer to be called to the counter is V1.

At this point, we realize that to implement "VIP cutting in line," a regular Queue won't suffice because a Queue strictly adheres to the FIFO principle. What we need is a priority queue: `PriorityQueue`.

The difference between `PriorityQueue` and a regular Queue is that the dequeue order in a `PriorityQueue` depends on the priority of its elements. When calling `remove()` or `poll()` on a `PriorityQueue`, the element with the highest priority is always returned.

To use a `PriorityQueue`, we must define "priority" for each element. Let's look at the behavior of `PriorityQueue` through actual code:

```java
import java.util.PriorityQueue;
import java.util.Queue;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Queue<String> q = new PriorityQueue<>();
        // Adding 3 elements to the queue:
        q.offer("apple");
        q.offer("pear");
        q.offer("banana");
        System.out.println(q.poll()); // apple
        System.out.println(q.poll()); // banana
        System.out.println(q.poll()); // pear
        System.out.println(q.poll()); // null, because the queue is empty
    }
}
```

The order we put the elements in was "apple", "pear", "banana", but the order they were removed is "apple", "banana", "pear". This is because, based on the alphabetical order, "apple" comes first, and "pear" last.

Therefore, elements put into a `PriorityQueue` must implement the `Comparable` interface, and `PriorityQueue` will decide the dequeue priority based on the elements' sorting order.

What if we want to add elements that do not implement the `Comparable` interface? `PriorityQueue` allows us to provide a `Comparator` object to determine the order of two elements. Let's implement a `PriorityQueue` with a bank queue example:

```java
import java.util.Comparator;
import java.util.PriorityQueue;
import java.util.Queue;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Queue<User> q = new PriorityQueue<>(new UserComparator());
        // Adding 3 elements to the queue:
        q.offer(new User("Bob", "A1"));
        q.offer(new User("Alice", "A2"));
        q.offer(new User("Boss", "V1"));
        System.out.println(q.poll()); // Boss/V1
        System.out.println(q.poll()); // Bob/A1
        System.out.println(q.poll()); // Alice/A2
        System.out.println(q.poll()); // null, because the queue is empty
    }
}

class UserComparator implements Comparator<User> {
    public int compare(User u1, User u2) {
        if (u1.number.charAt(0) == u2.number.charAt(0)) {
            // If both numbers start with A or V, compare the numbers directly:
            int num1 = Integer.parseInt(u1.number.substring(1)); 
            int num2 = Integer.parseInt(u2.number.substring(1)); 
            return Integer.compare(num1, num2);
        }
        if (u1.number.charAt(0) == 'V') {
            // u1's number starts with V, higher priority:
            return -1;
        } else {
            return 1;
        }
    }
}

class User {
    public final String name;
    public final String number;

    public User(String name, String number) {
        this.name = name;
        this.number = number;
    }

    public String toString() {
        return name + "/" + number;
    }
}
```

The key to implementing `PriorityQueue` is the provided `UserComparator` object, which compares the size of two elements (smaller ones come first). `UserComparator` always prioritizes numbers starting with V, and only compares the magnitude of the numbers when their prefixes are the same.
