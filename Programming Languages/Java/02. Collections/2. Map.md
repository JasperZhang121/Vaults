We know that a List is a type of sequential list. Suppose we have a List storing Student instances, and we want to find the score of a specific Student by name within the List. What should we do?

The simplest method is to iterate through the List, compare the names for equality, and then return the specific element:

```java
List<Student> list = ...
Student target = null;
for (Student s : list) {
    if ("Xiao Ming".equals(s.name)) {
        target = s;
        break;
    }
}
System.out.println(target.score);
```

This need is actually quite common, which is to query a corresponding value by a key. Using a List for this purpose poses a very low efficiency issue, because it requires scanning through half of the elements on average to find the target, while a Map, a key-value mapping table data structure, is designed for efficiently finding values (elements) by keys quickly.

Here's how to implement the search for a Student by name using a Map:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Student s = new Student("Xiao Ming", 99);
        Map<String, Student> map = new HashMap<>();
        map.put("Xiao Ming", s); // Maps "Xiao Ming" to the Student instance
        Student target = map.get("Xiao Ming"); // Retrieves the Student instance by key
        System.out.println(target == s); // true, same instance
        System.out.println(target.score); // 99
        Student another = map.get("Bob"); // Tries to find another key
        System.out.println(another); // Not found, returns null
    }
}

class Student {
    public String name;
    public int score;
    public Student(String name, int score) {
        this.name = name;
        this.score = score;
    }
}
```

From the above code, we can see that `Map<K, V>` is a key-value mapping table. When we call the `put(K key, V value)` method, we map and store the key and value into the Map. Calling `V get(K key)` allows us to retrieve the corresponding value by key. If the key does not exist, it returns null. Similar to List, Map is also an interface, and the most commonly used implementation class is HashMap.

To simply check if a key exists, you can use the `boolean containsKey(K key)` method.

What happens if we call `put()` method twice with the same key but different values? For example:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Map<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        map.put("apple", 123);
        map.put("pear", 456);
        System.out.println(map.get("apple")); // 123
        map.put("apple", 789); // Put in "apple" as key again, but with value 789
        System.out.println(map.get("apple")); // 789
    }
}
```

Putting in a repeated key-value pair is not an issue, but a key can only be associated with one value. In the above code, initially, we map the key "apple" to the Integer object 123, then call `put()` again to map "apple" to 789. At this moment, the originally associated value object 123 is "overwritten". In fact, the signature of `put()` method is `V put(K key, V value)`, if the key already exists, `put()` will return the old value that was removed, otherwise, it returns null.

Always remember: There are no duplicate keys in a Map because putting the same key will only replace the value associated with the existing key-value pair. Moreover, in a Map, although keys cannot be duplicated, values can be repeated:

```java
Map<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
map.put("apple", 123);
map.put("pear", 123); // ok
```

**Iterating Over a Map**

To iterate over the keys of a Map, you can use a for-each loop to go through the Set collection returned by the `keySet()` method of the Map instance, which contains a collection of unique keys:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Map<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        map.put("apple", 123);
        map.put("pear", 456);
        map.put("banana", 789);
        for (String key : map.keySet()) {
            Integer value = map.get(key);
            System.out.println(key + " = " + value

);
        }
    }
}
```

To iterate over both keys and values simultaneously, you can use a for-each loop to go through the `entrySet()` collection of the Map object, which contains each key-value mapping:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Map<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        map.put("apple", 123);
        map.put("pear", 456);
        map.put("banana", 789);
        for (Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : map.entrySet()) {
            String key = entry.getKey();
            Integer value = entry.getValue();
            System.out.println(key + " = " + value);
        }
    }
}
```

Unlike List, Map stores key-value mapping relations and does not guarantee order. When iterating, the order may not be the same as the order keys were put in, nor is it necessarily the sorting order of the keys. When using Map, any logic that depends on the order is unreliable. For example, with HashMap, even if we put in "A", "B", "C" as keys, the iteration order is not guaranteed and can even vary across different JDK versions for the same code!

When iterating over a Map, do not assume the output keys are ordered.
