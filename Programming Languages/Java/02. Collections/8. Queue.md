Queue is a frequently used collection in programming. It essentially implements a First In First Out (FIFO) order. Unlike a List, which allows for inserting and deleting elements at any position, a Queue is limited to two operations:

- Adding an element to the end of the queue.
- Removing an element from the front of the queue.

In Java's standard library, the Queue interface defines several methods:

- `int size()`: Gets the length of the queue.
- `boolean add(E)/boolean offer(E)`: Adds an element to the end of the queue.
- `E remove()/E poll()`: Retrieves and removes the head of the queue.
- `E element()/E peek()`: Retrieves but does not remove the head of the queue.

Different implementations of the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Queue interface might or might not have a maximum length limit</mark>. Notice there are always two methods for adding, removing, and retrieving elements, as their behavior differs upon failure. Here's a summary:

| Action                      | Throws Exception | Returns false or null |
| --------------------------- | ---------------- | --------------------- |
| Add element to the end      | `add(E e)`       | `boolean offer(E e)`  |
| Remove and return head      | `E remove()`     | `E poll()`            |
| Return head without removal | `E element()`    | `E peek()`            |

For example, if we have a queue and perform an addition operation, using the `add()` method will throw an exception upon failure (perhaps due to exceeding the queue's capacity):

```java
Queue<String> q = ...
try {
    q.add("Apple");
    System.out.println("Addition successful");
} catch(IllegalStateException e) {
    System.out.println("Addition failed");
}
```

Using the `offer()` method to add elements will not throw an exception upon failure, but instead return false:

```java
Queue<String> q = ...
if (q.offer("Apple")) {
    System.out.println("Addition successful");
} else {
    System.out.println("Addition failed");
}
```

When we need to retrieve the head element from the Queue, calling `remove()` on an empty queue will throw an exception:

```java
Queue<String> q = ...
try {
    String s = q.remove();
    System.out.println("Retrieval successful");
} catch(IllegalStateException e) {
    System.out.println("Retrieval failed");
}
```

Using the `poll()` method will return `null` instead of throwing an exception upon failure:

```java
Queue<String> q = ...
String s = q.poll();
if (s != null) {
    System.out.println("Retrieval successful");
} else {
    System.out.println("Retrieval failed");
}
```

Thus, you can choose which set of methods to use based on your needs.

**Note:** Do not add `null` to a queue, as it complicates distinguishing between a `null` return from `poll()` due to the queue being empty or actually containing `null`.

Here's an example using `poll()` and `peek()` to illustrate the difference between "retrieve and remove" and "retrieve without removal". Every `poll()` call retrieves the head element and removes it from the queue:

```java
import java.util.LinkedList;
import java.util.Queue;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Queue<String> q = new LinkedList<>();
        // Adding 3 elements to the queue:
        q.offer("apple");
        q.offer("pear");
        q.offer("banana");
        // Retrieving elements from the queue:
        System.out.println(q.poll()); // apple
        System.out.println(q.poll()); // pear
        System.out.println(q.poll()); // banana
        System.out.println(q.poll()); // null, because the queue is empty
    }
}
```

Using `peek()`, since retrieving the head element does not remove it from the queue, you can repeatedly retrieve the same element:

```java
import java.util.LinkedList;
import java.util.Queue;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Queue<String> q = new LinkedList<>();
        // Adding 3 elements to the queue:
        q.offer("apple");
        q.offer("pear");
        q.offer("banana");
        // The head of the queue is always apple, because peek() does not remove it:
        System.out.println(q.peek()); // apple
        System.out.println(q.peek()); // apple
        System.out.println(q.peek()); // apple
    }
}
```

From the above code, we also learn that `LinkedList` implements both the `List` and `Queue` interfaces. However, when using it, if we treat it as a `List`, we get a `

List` reference; if we treat it as a `Queue`, we get a `Queue` reference:

```java
// This is a List:
List<String> list = new LinkedList<>();
// This is a Queue:
Queue<String> queue = new LinkedList<>();
```

Always writing code according to the principle of programming to an interface can greatly improve code quality.
