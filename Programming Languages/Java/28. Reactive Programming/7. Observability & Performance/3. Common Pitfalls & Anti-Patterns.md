1. **Calling `block()`/`subscribe()` in service layers** — return `Mono/Flux` and let the framework subscribe.
2. **Blocking I/O on event loops** — isolate on `boundedElastic`, install **BlockHound** in tests.
3. **Unbounded buffers** — always set upper bounds or use `latest/drop` strategies.
4. **Retry storms** — add jitter/backoff; stop on `4xx` or known non-retryable exceptions.
5. **Ignoring backpressure with hot sources** — prefer `Sinks` with proper overflow strategy.
6. **Too many thread hops** — each `publishOn/subscribeOn` costs; keep pipelines simple.
7. **Using `parallel()` for blocking work** — use `boundedElastic` instead.
8. **Mixing MVC and WebFlux types** in the same controller — keep them separate.
9. **No observability** — enable metrics/tracing before tuning.
10. **Global Hooks misused** — prefer local `checkpoint` and logger operators.
