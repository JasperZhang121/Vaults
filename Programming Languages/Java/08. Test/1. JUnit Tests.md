What exactly is unit testing? Unit testing involves writing test code for the smallest functional units of your application. In Java programs, the smallest functional unit is a method. Thus, unit testing for Java programs refers to the testing of individual Java methods.

**Benefits of Unit Testing:** Before diving into unit testing, let's understand Test-Driven Development (TDD).

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">TDD refers to the process of writing the interface first, followed immediately by the tests.</mark> Once the tests are written, the actual implementation begins. Throughout the implementation process, the code is tested continuously until all tests pass, signaling the completion of the implementation:

1. Write the interface.
2. Write the test.
3. Implement the code → Run tests (repeat until all tests pass).
4. Task complete.

This is the so-called TDD process. Of course, this represents an ideal scenario. In most cases, we already have the implementation and need to write tests for existing code.

Let's examine how to write tests through an example. Suppose we have written a class that calculates factorials, containing a single static method for this calculation:

```
n! = 1 × 2 × 3 × ... × n
```

Here's the code:

```java
public class Factorial {
    public static long fact(long n) {
        long r = 1;
        for (long i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            r = r * i;
        }
        return r;
    }
}
```

To test this method, a natural idea is to write a `main()` method and then run some test code:

```java
public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        if (fact(10) == 3628800) {
            System.out.println("pass");
        } else {
            System.out.println("fail");
        }
    }
}
```

Running the `main()` method allows us to execute the test code. However, using `main()` for testing has many disadvantages, such as only having one `main()` method, not being able to separate test code, and the inability to print expected vs. actual results.

### JUnit
JUnit is an open-source framework for Java, designed specifically for unit testing. It's the de facto standard framework for unit testing, and every Java developer should learn and use JUnit for writing unit tests.

JUnit simplifies organizing test code, running them at any time, and seeing the results of successful and failed tests. It can also generate test reports, including success rates and code coverage metrics. For high-quality code, test coverage should be above 80%.

Most IDEs integrate JUnit, allowing direct writing and running of JUnit tests within the IDE. The latest version of JUnit is JUnit 5.

**Benefits of Unit Testing:**
Unit testing ensures that individual methods operate as expected. If a method's code is modified, simply ensuring its corresponding unit tests pass is sufficient to deem the changes correct. Additionally, test code itself can serve as example code demonstrating how to call the method.

Using JUnit for unit testing allows us to easily use assertions to test expected results, conveniently organize and run tests, and easily review test outcomes. JUnit can be run directly within IDEs or integrated into automation tools like Maven for execution.

When writing unit tests, it's important to adhere to certain standards:

1. Unit test code itself must be very simple and immediately understandable, to avoid writing tests for the test code.
2. Each unit test should be independent of others and not rely on the order of execution.
3. Testing should not only cover common use cases but also focus on boundary conditions, such as input being 0, `null`, or an empty string "".
