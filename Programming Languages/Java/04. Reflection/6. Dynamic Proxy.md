Let's compare the differences between Java's classes and interfaces:

- Classes (non-abstract) can be instantiated;
- Interfaces cannot be instantiated.

Variables of all interface types are always assigned through an instance that is upcast to the interface type:

```java
CharSequence cs = new StringBuilder();
```

Is it possible to directly create an instance of an interface at runtime without writing an implementation class?

This is possible because the Java standard library provides a mechanism called Dynamic Proxy, which can dynamically create an instance of an interface at runtime.

What does "dynamically create at runtime" mean? It sounds complicated. Dynamic proxy, as opposed to static, refers to the following. Let's see how static code is written:

Define an interface:

```java
public interface Hello {
    void morning(String name);
}
```

Write an implementation class:

```java
public class HelloWorld implements Hello {
    public void morning(String name) {
        System.out.println("Good morning, " + name);
    }
}
```

Create an instance, cast it to the interface, and call it:

```java
Hello hello = new HelloWorld();
hello.morning("Bob");
```

This approach is how we usually write code.

Another method is dynamic code. We still define the interface Hello, but we do not write an implementation class. Instead, we directly create a Hello interface object through JDK's `Proxy.newProxyInstance()`. This method, where no implementation class is written but an interface object is dynamically created at runtime, is known as dynamic code. The JDK's method of dynamically creating interface objects is called dynamic proxy.

A simplest dynamic proxy implementation looks like this:

```java
import java.lang.reflect.InvocationHandler;
import java.lang.reflect.Method;
import java.lang.reflect.Proxy;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        InvocationHandler handler = new InvocationHandler() {
            @Override
            public Object invoke(Object proxy, Method method, Object[] args) throws Throwable {
                System.out.println(method);
                if (method.getName().equals("morning")) {
                    System.out.println("Good morning, " + args[0]);
                }
                return null;
            }
        };
        Hello hello = (Hello) Proxy.newProxyInstance(
            Hello.class.getClassLoader(), // Pass in ClassLoader
            new Class[] { Hello.class }, // Pass in interfaces to implement
            handler); // Pass in InvocationHandler for handling method calls
        hello.morning("Bob");
    }
}

interface Hello {
    void morning(String name);
}
```


The method for dynamically creating an interface instance at runtime is as follows:

1. Define an `InvocationHandler` instance, which is responsible for implementing the method calls of the interface;
2. Create an interface instance through `Proxy.newProxyInstance()`, which needs three parameters:
   - The ClassLoader to use, usually the ClassLoader of the interface class;
   - The array of interfaces to implement, at least one interface must be passed in;
   - The `InvocationHandler` instance to handle method calls of the interface.
3. Cast the returned `Object` to the interface.

Dynamic proxy is essentially the JVM dynamically creating class bytecode and loading it during runtime. There is no black magic involved. Rewriting the above dynamic proxy as a static implementation class would look something like this:

```java
public class HelloDynamicProxy implements Hello {
    InvocationHandler handler;
    public HelloDynamicProxy(InvocationHandler handler) {
        this.handler = handler;
    }
    public void morning(String name) {
        handler.invoke(
            this,
            Hello.class.getMethod("morning", String.class),
            new Object[] { name });
    }
}
```

This is essentially what the JVM does for us automaticallyâ€”writing a class like the one above (without needing the source code, directly generating bytecode). There's no black magic that allows directly instantiating interfaces.
