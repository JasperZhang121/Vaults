A Stack is a last-in-first-out (LIFO) data structure.

FIFO ensures that the element which enters the queue first will leave first, whereas LIFO, the foundation of a Stack, ensures that the element which enters last will leave first. This can be achieved by sealing off one end of the queue.

Operations in a Stack include:

- Pushing an element onto the stack: `push(E)`.
- Popping the top element off the stack: `pop()`.
- Peeking at the top element without popping it: `peek()`.

In Java, we can implement the functionality of a Stack using the `Deque` interface:

- Push an element onto the stack: `push(E)/addFirst(E)`.
- Pop the top element off the stack: `pop()/removeFirst()`.
- Peek at the top element without popping it: `peek()/peekFirst()`.

Why doesn't Java's collection framework have a separate Stack interface? It's because there's an existing legacy class named `Stack`, and for compatibility reasons, a new Stack interface couldn't be created. Therefore, the `Deque` interface is used to "simulate" a Stack.

When using `Deque` as a Stack, it's advisable only to call `push()/pop()/peek()` methods, rather than `addFirst()/removeFirst()/peekFirst()`, to keep the code clear.

**Applications of Stack**

Stacks are extensively used in computing. The JVM manages Java method calls using a stack data structure. For example:

```java
static void main(String[] args) {
    foo(123);
}

static String foo(int x) {
    return "F-" + bar(x + 1);
}

static int bar(int x) {
    return x << 2;
}
```

The JVM creates a method call stack; each method call pushes parameters onto the stack, executes the corresponding method, and when the method returns, its return value is pushed onto the stack. The calling method retrieves the return value by popping the stack.

Since the method call stack has a capacity limit, excessive nested calls can cause stack overflow, leading to a `StackOverflowError`:

```java
// Testing infinite recursive calls
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        increase(1);
    }

    static int increase(int x) {
        return increase(x) + 1;
    }
}
```

Another application of Stack is converting integers into strings of different bases. For example, converting the integer 12500 into a hexadecimal string can utilize a stack.

Computing infix expressions, commonly used in programming, involves converting them to postfix expressions (RPN - Reverse Polish Notation) for the computer to evaluate. This conversion process also employs stacks. Computing postfix expressions doesn't consider operator precedence, making it straightforward. This simplicity is why stacks are fundamental in evaluating expressions and managing function calls within computing environments.
