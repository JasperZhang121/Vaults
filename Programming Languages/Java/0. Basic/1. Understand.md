### Analyzing the Basic Structure of a Complete Java Program

```java
/**
 * Comments for automatic documentation creation
 */
public class Hello {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Outputs text to the screen:
        System.out.println("Hello, world!");
        /* Multi-line comment starts
           Comment content
           Multi-line comment ends */
    }
} // end of class definition
```
Since Java is an object-oriented language, <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">the basic unit of a program is the class</mark>. `class` is a keyword, and here the class name is `Hello`:

```java
public class Hello { // Class name is Hello
    // ...
} // end of class definition
```

#### Class Naming Conventions:

- Class names must start with a letter, followed by a combination of letters, digits, and underscores.
- It's customary to start with a capital letter.

Good class naming examples:
- `Hello`
- `NoteBook`
- `VRPlayer`

Poor class naming examples:
- `hello`
- `Good123`
- `Note_Book`
- `_World`

Note that `public` is an access modifier, indicating the class is public.

Without `public`, it will compile correctly, but the class won't be executable from the command line.

Inside the class, you can define several methods (methods):

```java
public class Hello {
    public static void main(String[] args) { // The method name is main
        // Method code...
    } // end of method definition
}
```

Method defines a set of executable statements. The code inside the method will be executed in sequence.

Here, the method name is `main`, and the return type is `void`, indicating no return value.

`public` can modify both class and method. The keyword `static` is another modifier, indicating a static method. For now, we need to know that the entry method in Java must be static, named `main`, with parameters as a String array.

Method naming conventions are similar to class, but with the first letter in lowercase.

Good method naming examples:
- `main`
- `goodMorning`
- `playVR`

Poor method naming examples:
- `Main`
- `good123`
- `good_morning`
- `_playVR`

Inside a method, statements are the actual executable code. Every statement in Java must end with a semicolon:

```java
public class Hello {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, world!"); // Statement
    }
}
```

In Java, comments are text for human reading and are not part of the program, so the compiler automatically ignores them.

Java has three types of comments. The first type is single-line comments, starting with double slashes and ending at the line's end:

```java
// This is a comment...
```

Multi-line comments start with `/*` and end with `*/`, and can span multiple lines:

```java
/*
This is a comment
blablabla...
This is also a comment
*/
```

There's also a special kind of multi-line comment, starting with `/**` and ending with `*/`. If there are multiple lines, each usually starts with an asterisk:

```java
/**
 * Comments for automatic documentation creation
 * 
 * @author liaoxuefeng
 */
public class Hello {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, world!");
    }
}
```

This special type of multi-line comment is used for <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">automatic documentation creation and should be written at the class and method definition</mark>.

Java programs don't have strict format requirements; a few extra spaces or line breaks don't affect the correctness of the program. However, it's important to develop good programming habits and adhere to the coding format conventionally accepted in the Java community.
