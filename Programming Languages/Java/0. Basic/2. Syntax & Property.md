### Basic Data Types in Java

Basic data types are those types that the CPU can directly operate on. Java defines the following basic data types:

- **Integer Types**: `byte`, `short`, `int`, `long`
- **Floating-point Types**: `float`, `double`
- **Character Type**: `char`
- **Boolean Type**: `boolean`

#### Understanding the Differences Between These Data Types

To understand these differences, we need a basic understanding of computer memory structure.

- The smallest storage unit in computer memory is a byte. A byte is an 8-bit binary number, comprising 8 bits. Its binary representation ranges from 00000000 to 11111111, which translates to 0 to 255 in decimal, or 00 to ff in hexadecimal.

- Memory units are numbered starting from 0, known as memory addresses. Each memory unit can be seen as a room, with the memory address being the room number.

```ascii
      ┌───┐
  byte │   │
       └───┘
       ┌───┬───┐
 short │   │   │
       └───┴───┘
       ┌───┬───┬───┬───┐
   int │   │   │   │   │
       └───┴───┴───┴───┘
       ┌───┬───┬───┬───┬───┬───┬───┬───┐
  long │   │   │   │   │   │   │   │   │
       └───┴───┴───┴───┴───┴───┴───┴───┘
       ┌───┬───┬───┬───┐
 float │   │   │   │   │
       └───┴───┴───┴───┘
       ┌───┬───┬───┬───┬───┬───┬───┬───┐
double │   │   │   │   │   │   │   │   │
       └───┴───┴───┴───┴───┴───┴───┴───┘
       ┌───┬───┐
  char │   │   │
```


- A `byte` is exactly one byte, while `long` and `double` require eight bytes.

#### Integer Types

For integer types, Java <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">only defines signed integers</mark>. Therefore, the highest bit (bit) represents the sign (0 for positive, 1 for negative). The maximum range for various integer types is as follows:

- `byte`: -128 to 127
- `short`: -32768 to 32767
- `int`: -2147483648 to 2147483647
- `long`: -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    int i = 2147483647;
    int i2 = -2147483648;
    int i3 = 2_000_000_000; // Adding underscores for easier identification
    int i4 = 0xff0000; // Hexadecimal representation of 16711680
    int i5 = 0b1000000000; // Binary representation of 512

    long n1 = 9000000000000000000L; // Need to add 'L' at the end for long type
    long n2 = 900; // No 'L' added, here 900 is int, but int can be assigned to long
    int i6 = 900L; // Error: Cannot assign long type to int



	float f1 = 3.14f;
	float f2 = 3.14e38f; // Scientific notation for 3.14x10^38
	float f3 = 1.0; // Error: a number without 'f' at the end is of type double, cannot be assigned to float
	
	double d = 1.79e308;
	double d2 = -1.79e308;
	double d3 = 4.9e-324; // Scientific notation for 4.9x10^-324



	char a = 'A';
	char zh = '中';
	System.out.println(a);
	System.out.println(zh);
}
```


### Reference Types in Java

Besides the basic types mentioned earlier, all other types are reference types. One of the most commonly used reference types is the `String`:

```java
String s = "hello";
```

Reference type variables are similar to pointers in C language. They internally store an "address" that points to the location of some object in memory. 

#### Constants

When defining a variable, adding the `final` modifier makes this variable a constant:

```java
final double PI = 3.14; // PI is a constant
double r = 5.0;
double area = PI * r * r;
PI = 300; // compile error!
```

A constant, once initialized at the time of definition, cannot be reassigned. Attempting to do so will lead to a compilation error.

The purpose of constants is to avoid magic numbers by using meaningful variable names. For example, instead of writing 3.14 everywhere in the code, define a constant for it. If in the future we need to improve the calculation precision, we can simply modify the constant's definition, like changing it to 3.1416, instead of replacing 3.14 everywhere.

By convention, constant names are usually in all uppercase.

#### The `var` Keyword

Sometimes, the name of a type can be very long, making it cumbersome to write. For example:

```java
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
```

In such cases, to omit the variable type, you can use the `var` keyword:

```java
var sb = new StringBuilder();
```

The compiler automatically infers that the type of the variable `sb` is `StringBuilder`. To the compiler, the statement:

```java
var sb = new StringBuilder();
```

is automatically treated as:

```java
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
```

Therefore, using `var` to define a variable is merely a way to write less by omitting the variable type.

### Integer Arithmetic in Java

Integer values are not only precise, but integer operations are always exact, even division. This is because the division of two integers results in the integer part of the quotient:

```java
int x = 12345 / 67; // 184
```

For modulo operations, use `%`:

```java
int y = 12345 % 67; // The remainder of 12345 ÷ 67 is 17
```

**Important Note**: 
- Integer division in Java will throw a runtime error if the divisor is zero, but this will not cause a compile-time error.

- It's important to note that due to the limited range of integers, if the result of a calculation exceeds this range, it will lead to an overflow. Overflow does not result in an error but can produce unexpected results:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = 2147483640;
        int y = 15;
        int sum = x + y;
        System.out.println(sum); // -2147483641
    }
}
```

To understand the result of an integer overflow, let's consider adding the integers 2147483640 and 15 in binary:

```
  0111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1000 
+ 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 1111 
  ----------------------------------------- 
  1000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0111
```

The highest bit (leftmost) in the result is 1, which in a signed integer indicates a negative number. Therefore, the sum becomes a negative number due to overflow.

#### Resolving Overflow Issues

To resolve the overflow problem demonstrated above, we can use the `long` data type instead of `int`. `long` has a much larger range for integer values, so the result will not overflow:

```java
long x = 2147483640;
long y = 15;
long sum = x + y;
System.out.println(sum); // 2147483655
```

---
### Bitwise Shift Operations in Java

In computers, integers are always represented in binary form. For example, the binary representation of the `int` type integer 7, using 4 bytes, is as follows:

```
00000000 00000000 00000000 00000111
```

We can perform shift operations on integers. Shifting the integer 7 to the left by 1 bit results in the integer 14, and shifting it left by two bits results in 28:

```java
int n = 7;        // 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000111 = 7
int a = n << 1;   // 00000000 00000000 00000000 00001110 = 14
int b = n << 2;   // 00000000 00000000 00000000 00011100 = 28
int c = n << 28;  // 01110000 00000000 00000000 00000000 = 1879048192
int d = n << 29;  // 11100000 00000000 00000000 00000000 = -536870912
```

When shifting left by 29 bits, the result becomes negative due to the highest bit turning into 1.

Similarly, right-shifting the integer 28 results in the following:

```java
int n = 7;        // 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000111 = 7
int a = n >> 1;   // 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000011 = 3
int b = n >> 2;   // 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000001 = 1
int c = n >> 3;   // 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 = 0
```

If we right-shift a negative number, the highest bit (1) remains unchanged, and the result is still a negative number:

```java
int n = -536870912;
int a = n >> 1;   // 11110000 00000000 00000000 00000000 = -268435456
int b = n >> 2;   // 11111000 00000000 00000000 00000000 = -134217728
int c = n >> 28;  // 11111111 11111111 11111111 11111110 = -2
int d = n >> 29;  // 11111111 11111111 11111111 11111111 = -1
```

There is also an unsigned right shift operation, `>>>`, which always fills the high-order bits with 0, regardless of the sign. Therefore, an unsigned right shift of a negative number will turn it into a positive number, as the highest bit changes from 1 to 0:

```java
int n = -536870912;
int a = n >>> 1;  // 01110000 00000000 00000000 00000000 = 1879048192
int b = n >>> 2;  // 00111000 00000000 00000000 00000000 = 939524096
int c = n >>> 29; // 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000111 = 7
int d = n >>> 31; // 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000001 = 1
```

### Floating-Point Operations in Java

Floating-point operations in Java, compared to integer operations, are limited to basic arithmetic computations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. They cannot perform bitwise or shift operations.

#### Key Characteristics of Floating-Point Numbers

- **Range**: Floating-point numbers have a large range of representation in computers, but they come with a critical characteristic: they often cannot represent values precisely.

- **Precision Issues**: For instance, the floating-point number 0.1 cannot be precisely represented in a computer. This is because the decimal number 0.1 translates into a recurring binary fraction, and both `float` and `double` can only store an approximation of 0.1. However, certain floating-point numbers like 0.5 can be represented exactly.

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double x = 1.0 / 10;
        double y = 1 - 9.0 / 10;
        System.out.println(x);
        System.out.println(y);
    }
}
```

This characteristic is due to the way floating-point numbers are stored and the fact that some decimal numbers cannot be accurately represented in binary form, leading to potential precision issues in calculations involving such numbers.

### Comparing Floating-Point Numbers in Java

Due to the inherent calculation error in floating-point arithmetic, directly comparing two floating-point numbers for equality often yields incorrect results. The correct method to compare them is to check if the absolute difference between the two numbers is less than a very small threshold:

```java
// Comparing if x and y are equal by calculating the absolute difference:
double r = Math.abs(x - y);
// Then check if the absolute value is small enough:
if (r < 0.00001) {
    // Considered as equal
} else {
    // Not equal
}
```

#### Representation of Floating-Point Numbers

- Floating-point numbers have a more complex memory representation compared to integers.
- Java's floating-point numbers fully comply with the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">IEEE 754 standard</mark>, which is the standard representation method for floating-point numbers supported by most computer platforms.

This approach to comparing floating-point numbers accounts for the small inaccuracies that can arise due to the way these numbers are stored and processed in computer systems.

### Type Promotion in Arithmetic Operations

In Java, when an integer and a floating-point number are used in an operation, the integer is automatically promoted to a floating-point number:

```java
// Type Promotion Example
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 5;
        double d = 1.2 + 24.0 / n; // 6.0
        System.out.println(d);
    }
}
```

**Note**: In a complex arithmetic expression involving only integers, automatic promotion does not occur. For example:

```java
double d = 1.2 + 24 / 5; // Result is 5.2
```

Here, the compiler treats `24 / 5` as integer division, resulting in 4.

### Overflow in Arithmetic

- Integer operations throw an error when the divisor is zero.
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Floating-point operations do not throw an error when the divisor is zero</mark> but return special values:

  - `NaN` (Not a Number)
  - `Infinity` (Positive Infinity)
  - `-Infinity` (Negative Infinity)

Example:

```java
double d1 = 0.0 / 0;   // NaN
double d2 = 1.0 / 0;   // Infinity
double d3 = -1.0 / 0;  // -Infinity
```

### Casting Floating-Point to Integer

You can cast a floating-point number to an integer. During this casting, the decimal part is truncated. If the result exceeds the integer's range, it returns the maximum integer value:

```java
int n1 = (int) 12.3;    // 12
int n2 = (int) 12.7;    // 12
int n3 = (int) -12.7;   // -12
int n4 = (int) (12.7 + 0.5); // 13 (Rounding)
int n5 = (int) 1.2e20;  // 2147483647 (Max int value)
```

For <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">rounding to the nearest integer</mark>, add 0.5 and then cast:

```java
// Rounding to the nearest integer
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double d = 2.6;
        int n = (int) (d + 0.5);
        System.out.println(n);
    }
}
```

### Boolean Type in Java

The boolean type in Java can only have two values: `true` or `false`.

#### Boolean Operations

Boolean operations include:

- **Comparison Operators**: `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, `==`, `!=`
- **Logical AND**: `&&`
- **Logical OR**: `||`
- **Logical NOT**: `!`

Examples:

```java
boolean isGreater = 5 > 3;               // true
int age = 12;
boolean isZero = age == 0;               // false
boolean isNonZero = !isZero;             // true
boolean isAdult = age >= 18;             // false
boolean isTeenager = age > 6 && age < 18; // true
```

#### Operator Precedence

The precedence of these operators from highest to lowest is:

1. `!`
2. `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`
3. `==`, `!=`
4. `&&`
5. `||`

### Short-Circuit Evaluation

Boolean operations in Java feature short-circuit evaluation, meaning if the result of a boolean expression can be determined early, the rest of the calculation is not executed.

Example of short-circuiting with `&&`:

```java
// Short-Circuit Evaluation
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        boolean b = 5 < 3;
        boolean result = b && (5 / 0 > 0);
        System.out.println(result); // false, no error due to short-circuiting
    }
}
```

Similarly, for `||` operations, if the first value can be determined as `true`, the subsequent calculation is not performed:

```java
boolean result = true || (5 / 0 > 0); // true
```

### Ternary Operator

Java provides a ternary operator `b ? x : y` that returns one of two expressions based on the result of the boolean expression `b`.

Example of ternary operation:

```java
// Ternary Operation
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = -100;
        int x = n >= 0 ? n : -n; // Absolute value of n
        System.out.println(x);
    }
}
```

The ternary operator first evaluates `b`. If `b` is `true`, it evaluates only `x`, otherwise, it evaluates only `y`. Note that the types of `x` and `y` must be the same, as the return value is either `x` or `y`, not a boolean.

### Character Type `char`

The `char` type in Java is a basic data type and stands for "character". A `char` can hold a single Unicode character:

```java
char c1 = 'A';
char c2 = '中';
```

Java uses Unicode to represent characters in memory, so both an English and a Chinese character are represented by a `char` and occupy two bytes. To display a character's Unicode code, assign a `char` directly to an `int`:

```java
int n1 = 'A';   // Unicode code of 'A' is 65
int n2 = '中';  // Unicode code of '中' is 20013
```

You can also use escape sequences with `\u` followed by the Unicode code:

```java
char c3 = '\u0041'; // 'A', as hexadecimal 0041 = decimal 65
char c4 = '\u4e2d'; // '中', as hexadecimal 4e2d = decimal 20013
```

### String Type

Unlike `char`, the `String` type is a reference type, denoted by double quotes `"..."`. A string can contain from zero to many characters:

```java
String s = "";         // Empty string, contains 0 characters
String s1 = "A";       // Contains 1 character
String s2 = "ABC";     // Contains 3 characters
String s3 = "中文 ABC"; // Contains 6 characters, including a space
```

To include a double quote inside a string, use the escape character `\`:

```java
String s = "abc\"xyz"; // Contains 7 characters: a, b, c, ", x, y, z
```

For a backslash character, use `\\`:

```java
String s = "abc\\xyz"; // Contains 7 characters: a, b, c, \, x, y, z
```

Common escape sequences include:
- `\"` for double quote
- `\'` for single quote
- `\\` for backslash
- `\n` for newline
- `\r` for carriage return
- `\t` for tab
- `\u####` for a Unicode character

For example:

```java
String s = "ABC\n\u4e2d\u6587"; // Contains 6 characters: A, B, C, newline, 中, 文
```

### String Concatenation

Java allows concatenation of strings with other data types using `+`, which is very convenient:

```java
// String Concatenation
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String s1 = "Hello";
        String s2 = "world";
        String s = s1 + " " + s2 + "!";
        System.out.println(s);
    }
}
```

### Multi-line Strings

From Java 13, multi-line strings can be represented with `"""..."""` (Text Blocks):

```java
// Multi-line String
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String s = """
                   SELECT * FROM
                     users
                   WHERE id > 100
                   ORDER BY name DESC
                   """;
        System.out.println(s);
    }
}
```

### Immutability of Strings

Java strings are immutable. Changing a string actually changes the reference, not the string itself:

```java
// Immutability of Strings
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String s = "hello";
        System.out.println(s); // Displays "hello"
        s = "world";
        System.out.println(s); // Displays "world"
    }
}
```

### Null Value

A reference type variable can point to `null`, meaning it does not point to any object:

```java
String s1 = null; // s1 is null
String s2 = s1;   // s2 is also null
String s3 = "";   // s3 points to an empty string, not null
```

It's important to distinguish between a null value and an empty string `""`.

### Array Types in Java

Arrays in Java allow you to store a collection of items of the same type. For example, to store the grades of 5 students, you could use an array instead of separate variables:

```java
// Array Example
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Grades of 5 students:
        int[] ns = new int[5];
        ns[0] = 68;
        ns[1] = 79;
        ns[2] = 91;
        ns[3] = 85;
        ns[4] = 62;
    }
}
```

Array variables are declared with the syntax `type[]`, such as `int[]`. Arrays are initialized using `new int[5]`, which creates an array that can hold 5 `int` elements.

#### Characteristics of Java Arrays

- All elements are initialized to their default values (0 for integers, 0.0 for floating points, `false` for booleans).
- Once created, the size of an array cannot be changed.
- Array indices start at 0.
- You can modify an array element using assignment, like `ns[1] = 79;`.
- The size of an array can be obtained using `ns.length`.

#### Array Initialization

Arrays can also be initialized with specified elements, allowing the compiler to infer the size:

```java
// Array Initialization
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Grades of 5 students:
        int[] ns = { 68, 79, 91, 85, 62 };
    }
}
```

#### Immutability of Arrays

While arrays themselves are mutable (their elements can be changed), the reference to an array is immutable. Changing the reference to an array makes it point to a new array:

```java
// Array Reference
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] ns = { 68, 79, 91, 85, 62 };
        ns = new int[] { 1, 2, 3 };
    }
}
```

### String Arrays

When dealing with arrays of reference types like strings, modifying an array element updates the reference:

```java
// String Array
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String[] names = {"ABC", "XYZ", "zoo"};
        names[1] = "cat"; // Changes the reference of names[1]
    }
}
```

In this case, changing `names[1]` from `"XYZ"` to `"cat"` only changes the reference, not the string itself. The string `"XYZ"` remains unchanged and becomes inaccessible through `names[1]`.
