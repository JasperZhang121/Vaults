What are Annotations? Annotations are a special type of "comment" placed before classes, methods, fields, or parameters in Java source code:

```java
// this is a component:
@Resource("hello")
public class Hello {
    @Inject
    int n;

    @PostConstruct
    public void hello(@Param String name) {
        System.out.println(name);
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Hello";
    }
}
```

Comments are directly ignored by the compiler, while annotations can be packed into the class file by the compiler. Therefore, annotations are a kind of "metadata" used for marking.

**The Role of Annotations**
From the JVM's perspective, annotations themselves do not affect the logic of the code. How annotations are used is entirely determined by tools.

Java's annotations can be divided into three categories:

1. **Annotations Used by the Compiler**: For example:
   - `@Override`: This annotation <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">lets the compiler check whether a method correctly implements an override</mark>.
   - `@SuppressWarnings`: This tells the compiler to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">ignore warnings generated by the code</mark> here.
   These types of annotations are not compiled into the `.class` file. They are discarded by the compiler after compilation.

2. **Annotations Used by Tools Processing `.class` Files**: Some tools may dynamically modify the class upon loading to implement some special functions. These types of annotations are compiled into the `.class` file but do not exist in memory after loading. They are only used by some underlying libraries, and generally, we do not need to handle them ourselves.

3. **Annotations Readable at Runtime**: These exist in the JVM after loading and are the most commonly used type of annotation. For example, a method configured with `@PostConstruct` will be automatically called after the constructor (this function is implemented by reading the annotation in Java code; the JVM does not recognize the annotation itself).

When defining an annotation, you can also define configuration parameters. Configuration parameters can include:
- All primitive types;
- `String`;
- Enum types;
- Arrays of primitive types, `String`, `Class`, and enums.

Since configuration parameters must be constants, the above restrictions ensure that the value of each parameter is determined at the time the annotation is defined.

Annotation configuration parameters can have default values, and the default value will be used if a configuration parameter is missing.

Moreover, most annotations will have a configuration parameter named `value`. Assigning a value to this parameter can be done by writing the constant directly, effectively omitting the `value` parameter.

Writing only the annotation implies that all default values are used.

For example, consider the following code:

```java
public class Hello {
    @Check(min=0, max=100, value=55)
    public int n;

    @Check(value=99)
    public int p;

    @Check(99) // Equivalent to @Check(value=99)
    public int x;

    @Check
    public int y;
}
```

`@Check` is an annotation. The first `@Check(min=0, max=100, value=55)` clearly defines three parameters. The second `@Check(value=99)` defines only a `value` parameter, which is actually identical to `@Check(99)`. The last `@Check` indicates that all parameters use default values.
