Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that is based on the concept of objects. It allows programmers to model real-world entities in code by creating **classes** that encapsulate data and behavior.

---

## Classes and Objects

A **class** is a blueprint or template that defines the attributes and behavior of a real-world entity. An **object** is an instance of a class.

## Encapsulation

**Encapsulation** is the process of hiding the implementation details of a class from other parts of the program. It is achieved by making the class members (fields and methods) private and providing public methods (getters and setters) to access and modify the data.

## Inheritance

**Inheritance** is the process of creating new classes from existing classes. The new classes inherit the attributes and behavior of the parent class and can also add new attributes and behavior.

## Polymorphism

**Polymorphism** is the ability of an object to take on multiple forms. It is achieved through method overloading (multiple methods with the same name but different parameters) and method overriding (a subclass providing its own implementation of a method that is already defined in the parent class).

## Abstraction

**Abstraction** is the process of representing complex real-world entities in a simplified manner. It allows programmers to focus on the important aspects of an entity while ignoring the irrelevant details.

## Benefits of OOP

By using OOP principles, programmers can write code that is modular, reusable, and maintainable.

## Usage

OOP is widely used in modern programming languages such as Java, C++, and Python, among others.
