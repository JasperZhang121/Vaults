```java
class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public String getName() {...}
    public void setName(String name) {...}
    public int getAge() {...}
    public void setAge(int age) {...}
}

class Student extends Person {
    // no repeat
    private int score;

    public int getScore() { … }
    public void setScore(int score) { … }
}
```

Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that allows a new class (subclass) to inherit properties and behaviors from an existing class (superclass).

#### Superclasses and Subclasses
- **Superclass (Parent Class/Base Class)**: The class from which properties and behaviors are inherited. For example, `Person`.
- **Subclass (Child Class/Extended Class)**: The class that inherits from the superclass. For example, `Student` inherits from `Person`.

#### Inheritance Hierarchy
- Without explicitly extending a class, Java classes automatically extend `Object` class. Hence, except for `Object`, every class inherits from some superclass.
- Java supports <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">single inheritance</mark>, meaning a class can only inherit from one superclass.

  ```
  Object
    ↑
  Person
    ↑
  Student
  ```

- Example with `Teacher` and `Student` inheriting from `Person`:

  ```
       Object
         ↑
       Person
      ↗    ↖
  Student   Teacher
  ```

#### Protected Access Modifier
- Subclasses <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">cannot access private fields or methods of the superclass</mark>.
- Use `protected` access modifier to allow subclasses to access fields or methods.

  ```java
  class Person {
      protected String name;
      protected int age;
  }

  class Student extends Person {
      public String hello() {
          return "Hello, " + name; // Accessible due to protected
      }
  }
  ```

#### The `super` Keyword
- `super` refers to the superclass. It's used to access fields or methods from the superclass.

  ```java
  class Student extends Person {
      public String hello() {
          return "Hello, " + super.name;
      }
  }
  ```

#### Constructor Inheritance
- Subclasses do not inherit constructors from the superclass.
- A subclass must explicitly call a constructor of the superclass using `super()`.

  ```java
  class Student extends Person {
      protected int score;

      public Student(String name, int age, int score) {
          super(name, age); // Call to superclass constructor
          this.score = score;
      }
  }
  ```

#### Preventing Inheritance
- Normally, any class without the `final` modifier can be extended.
- From Java 15, `sealed` classes allow defining explicit subclasses using the `permits` keyword.

  ```java
  public sealed class Shape permits Rect, Circle, Triangle {
      // ...
  }
  ```

#### Upcasting and Downcasting
- **Upcasting**: Converting a subclass type to a superclass type. It's always safe.

  ```java
  Student s = new Student();
  Person p = s; // Upcasting
  ```

- **Downcasting**: Converting a superclass type to a subclass type. It can be unsafe and might throw a `ClassCastException`.

  ```java
  Person p = new Student();
  Student s = (Student) p; // Downcasting
  ```

- Use `instanceof` to check before downcasting.

  ```java
  if (p instanceof Student) {
      Student s = (Student) p;
  }
  ```

#### Inheritance vs Composition
- Inheritance models an "is-a" relationship.
- Composition models a "has-a" relationship.

  ```java
  class Student extends Person {
      protected Book book; // Composition
      protected int score;
  }
  ```

Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class, forming a hierarchical relationship. It is crucial to use inheritance appropriately, respecting the "is-a" relationship, and preferring composition for "has-a" relationships.
