1.  **Bank Account:**

```java
public class BankAccount {
    private int accountNumber;
    private String accountHolderName;
    private double balance;

    // Constructor
    public BankAccount(int accountNumber, String accountHolderName, double balance) {
        this.accountNumber = accountNumber;
        this.accountHolderName = accountHolderName;
        this.balance = balance;
    }

    // Getter methods
    public int getAccountNumber() {
        return accountNumber;
    }

    public String getAccountHolderName() {
        return accountHolderName;
    }

    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }

    // Setter method
    public void setBalance(double balance) {
        this.balance = balance;
    }
}
```

In this example, the `BankAccount` class has private attributes `accountNumber`, `accountHolderName`, and `balance`. These attributes cannot be accessed directly from outside the class. Instead, public getter methods are provided to access the account details, and a public setter method is provided to modify the balance. This is an example of encapsulation, as the account holder's details are private and can only be accessed through the getter methods.
