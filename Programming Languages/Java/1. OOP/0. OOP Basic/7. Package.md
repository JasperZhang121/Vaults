- A package in Java is used to group related classes.
- Think of it as a folder in a file directory.
- It's a way to organize files into different directories.
- Package names are written in all lower case to avoid conflict with class names.

### Defining a Package
- To define a package in Java, you use the `package` keyword at the top of the source file.
- Example: `package com.itranswarp.sample;`

### Package Naming Convention
- Often reverse domain name is used to ensure uniqueness (e.g., `com.companyname.projectname`).
- Domain name based packages can avoid conflicts with classes in the standard Java libraries.

### Using Classes from Packages
- To use a class from a package, you can use the class’s simple name if it’s in the same package or a subpackage.
- If it’s in a different package, you’ll need to either use the fully qualified name (like `com.itranswarp.world.Person`) or import the class.

### Import Statement
- The `import` statement in Java is used to bring in other classes from other packages.
- Example: `import com.itranswarp.world.Person;`
- You can use `*` to import all classes from a package (e.g., `import com.itranswarp.world.*;`), but it's generally better to import only the classes you need.
- You can also import static members of classes.

### Best Practices
- Avoid class name conflicts with Java's standard library.
- Use clear, logical structure for package names.
- Use reverse domain name to ensure uniqueness.

### Compiling and Running with Packages
- When compiling, use the `-d` flag to specify the destination for class files.
- The source files must reflect the package structure.
- When running a Java program, specify the classpath and the fully qualified name of the class with the `main` method.
- Example: `java -cp ./bin com.itranswarp.sample.Main`
