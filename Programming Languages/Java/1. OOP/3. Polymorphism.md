```java
public class Animal {
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("The animal makes a sound");
    }
}

public class Dog extends Animal {
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("The dog barks");
    }
}

public class Cat extends Animal {
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("The cat meows");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal animal1 = new Dog();
        Animal animal2 = new Cat();

        animal1.makeSound(); // outputs "The dog barks"
        animal2.makeSound(); // outputs "The cat meows"
    }
}
```

In this example, we have a parent class `Animal` and two child classes `Dog` and `Cat` that inherit from it. Each of these classes has its own implementation of the `makeSound()` method.

In the `Main` class, we create two `Animal` objects - one of type `Dog` and one of type `Cat`. We then call the `makeSound()` method on each object.

Because the `Dog` and `Cat` classes override the `makeSound()` method, when we call this method on an object of type `Dog`, the `Dog` class implementation of `makeSound()` is called, and when we call it on an object of type `Cat`, the `Cat` class implementation of `makeSound()` is called.

This demonstrates how polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated as if they are of the same type, and allows methods to be called on objects without knowing their specific class.
