```java
// Parent class
class Vehicle {
    protected String make;
    protected String model;
    protected int year;

    public Vehicle(String make, String model, int year) {
        this.make = make;
        this.model = model;
        this.year = year;
    }

    public String getInfo() {
        return year + " " + make + " " + model;
    }
}

// Child class
class Car extends Vehicle {
    private int numDoors;

    public Car(String make, String model, int year, int numDoors) {
        super(make, model, year);
        this.numDoors = numDoors;
    }

    public String getInfo() {
	        return super.getInfo() + ", " + numDoors + " doors";
    }
}

// Example usage
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Vehicle vehicle = new Vehicle("Toyota", "Camry", 2020);
        System.out.println(vehicle.getInfo()); // Output: 2020 Toyota Camry

        Car car = new Car("Honda", "Accord", 2021, 4);
        System.out.println(car.getInfo()); // Output: 2021 Honda Accord, 4 doors
    }
}
```

In this example, we have a parent class `Vehicle` that has attributes `make`, `model`, and `year`, and a child class `Car` that extends the `Vehicle` class and adds an additional attribute `numDoors`. The `Car` class overrides the `getInfo()` method of the `Vehicle` class to add the number of doors to the vehicle information.

When we create a `Vehicle` object and call its `getInfo()` method, it returns the make, model, and year of the vehicle. When we create a `Car` object and call its `getInfo()` method, it calls the `getInfo()` method of the parent class using the `super` keyword and appends the number of doors to the vehicle information.

This is an example of inheritance, as the `Car` class inherits the attributes and methods of the `Vehicle` class and adds its own attributes and methods. Inheritance allows for code reuse and makes the program more organized.
