### String
In Java, `String` is a reference type and is also a class itself. However, the Java compiler treats `String` specially, allowing you to directly represent a string using double quotes (`"..."`).

```java
String s1 = "Hello!";
```

Internally, a string in Java is represented using a `char[]` array. So, you can also create a string like this:

```java
String s2 = new String(new char[] {'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', '!'});
```

However, because `String` is so commonly used, Java provides a convenient way to represent string literals using double quotes.

One important feature of Java strings is immutability. This immutability is achieved through a `private final char[]` field inside the `String` class and the absence of any methods that modify this `char[]`.

When comparing strings in Java, it's important to <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">compare their content, not their references</mark>. You should use the `equals()` method for content comparison rather than the `==` operator.

For example:

```java
String s1 = "hello";
String s2 = "hello";
System.out.println(s1 == s2); // true (due to string interning)
System.out.println(s1.equals(s2)); // true
```

In this case, both `==` and `equals()` return `true` <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">because the Java compiler interns string literals.</mark>

However, when you create strings differently, `==` may not return `true`:

```java
String s1 = "hello";
String s2 = "HELLO".toLowerCase();
System.out.println(s1 == s2); // false
System.out.println(s1.equals(s2)); // true
```

So, the conclusion is that you should always use `equals()` for string comparison.

If you need to perform a case-insensitive comparison, you can use the `equalsIgnoreCase()` method.

The `String` class provides <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">various methods</mark> for working with strings, including:

- `contains(String)` to check if a string contains a substring.
- `indexOf(String)` to find the index of a substring.
- `lastIndexOf(String)` to find the last index of a substring.
- `startsWith(String)` to check if a string starts with a given prefix.
- `endsWith(String)` to check if a string ends with a given suffix.
- `substring(int)` to extract a substring from a given index to the end.
- `substring(int, int)` to extract a substring within a specified range.
- `trim()` to remove leading and trailing whitespace characters.
- `strip()` to remove leading and trailing whitespace characters, including non-breaking spaces (e.g., `\u3000`).
- `isEmpty()` to check if a string is empty (length is 0).
- `isBlank()` to check if a string is blank (contains only whitespace characters).
- `replace(char, char)` to replace characters.
- `replace(CharSequence, CharSequence)` to replace substrings.
- `split(String)` to split a string into an array of substrings.
- `join(CharSequence, CharSequence...)` to concatenate strings with a specified delimiter.
- `formatted(Object...)` and `String.format(String, Object...)` for string formatting using placeholders.

To convert other types to strings, you can use `String.valueOf()` or specific methods like `Integer.toString()`, `Double.toString()`, etc.

### Byte
For character encoding, Java uses Unicode to represent characters. The `String` class in Java represents text as a sequence of Unicode characters. You can manually convert strings to different encodings using the `getBytes()` method:

```java
byte[] utf8Bytes = "Hello".getBytes("UTF-8");
byte[] gbkBytes = "Hello".getBytes("GBK");
```

When converting `bytes[]` back to strings, you specify the encoding as well:

```java
String utf8String = new String(utf8Bytes, "UTF-8");
String gbkString = new String(gbkBytes, "GBK");
```

It's important to remember that `String` in Java always uses Unicode internally. When working with encodings, you are converting between bytes and Unicode characters.

### StringBuilder
The Java compiler has special handling for `String` that allows us to directly concatenate strings using the `+` operator.

Let's examine the following loop code:

```java
String s = "";
for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
    s = s + "," + i;
}
```

While it's possible to concatenate strings directly using `+`, in this loop, a new <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">string object is created and the old string is discarded in each iteration</mark>. As a result, most of the strings created are temporary objects, which not only wastes memory but also affects garbage collection efficiency.

To efficiently concatenate strings, the Java standard library provides `StringBuilder`, which is a mutable object that can preallocate a buffer. With `StringBuilder`, when you add characters to it, it doesn't create new temporary objects:

```java
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(1024);
for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
    sb.append(',');
    sb.append(i);
}
String s = sb.toString();
```

`StringBuilder` also supports chaining operations:

```java
// Chaining operations
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        var sb = new StringBuilder(1024);
        sb.append("Mr ")
          .append("Bob")
          .append("!")
          .insert(0, "Hello, ");
        System.out.println(sb.toString());
    }
}
```

If we examine the source code of `StringBuilder`, we can see that the key to chaining operations is that the `append()` method defined in `StringBuilder` returns `this`, allowing you to continuously call other methods on the same instance.

Inspired by `StringBuilder`, we can design our own classes that support chaining operations. For example, a counter that can be incremented continuously:

```java
// Chaining operations
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Adder adder = new Adder();
        adder.add(3)
             .add(5)
             .inc()
             .add(10);
        System.out.println(adder.value());
    }
}

class Adder {
    private int sum = 0;

    public Adder add(int n) {
        sum += n;
        return this;
    }

    public Adder inc() {
        sum++;
        return this;
    }

    public int value() {
        return sum;
    }
}
```

Note that for regular string concatenation using the `+` operator, you don't need to rewrite it as `StringBuilder`. The Java compiler automatically optimizes multiple consecutive `+` operations into `StringConcatFactory` operations during compilation. At runtime, `StringConcatFactory` automatically optimizes string concatenation into array copying or `StringBuilder` operations.

You may have also heard of `StringBuffer`, which was an early thread-safe version of `StringBuilder`. It used synchronization to ensure that multiple threads could safely operate on `StringBuffer`. However, synchronization introduced performance overhead. Nowadays, there's typically no need to use `StringBuffer`, and you should prefer `StringBuilder` for its better performance.

### StringJoiner

To efficiently concatenate strings, you should use `StringBuilder`.

Many times, we need to concatenate strings like this:

```java
// Hello Bob, Alice, Grace!
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String[] names = {"Bob", "Alice", "Grace"};
        var sb = new StringBuilder();
        sb.append("Hello ");
        for (String name : names) {
            sb.append(name).append(", ");
        }
        // Note: Remove the trailing ", ".
        sb.delete(sb.length() - 2, sb.length());
        sb.append("!");
        System.out.println(sb.toString());
    }
}
```

The need to concatenate arrays with separators like this is quite common. Therefore, the Java standard library provides a `StringJoiner` for this purpose:

```java
import java.util.StringJoiner;
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String[] names = {"Bob", "Alice", "Grace"};
        var sj = new StringJoiner(", ");
        for (String name : names) {
            sj.add(name);
        }
        System.out.println(sj.toString());
    }
}
```

Hold on! The result using `StringJoiner` lacks the "Hello " at the beginning and the "!" at the end! In such cases, you need to specify the "prefix" and "suffix" for the `StringJoiner`:

```java
import java.util.StringJoiner;
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String[] names = {"Bob", "Alice", "Grace"};
        var sj = new StringJoiner(", ", "Hello ", "!");
        for (String name : names) {
            sj.add(name);
        }
        System.out.println(sj.toString());
    }
}
```

`String.join()`

String also provides a static method called `join()`, which internally uses `StringJoiner` to concatenate strings. When you don't need to specify a "prefix" and "suffix," `String.join()` is more convenient:

```java
String[] names = {"Bob", "Alice", "Grace"};
var s = String.join(", ", names);
```
