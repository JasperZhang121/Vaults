In Java, we can define constants using `static final`. For example, if we want to define constants for the days of the week from Monday to Sunday using different integer values, we can do it like this:

```java
public class Weekday {
    public static final int SUN = 0;
    public static final int MON = 1;
    public static final int TUE = 2;
    public static final int WED = 3;
    public static final int THU = 4;
    public static final int FRI = 5;
    public static final int SAT = 6;
}
```

When using constants, you can refer to them like this:

```java
if (day == Weekday.SAT || day == Weekday.SUN) {
    // TODO: work at home
}
```

You can also define constants as strings, for example, defining constants for three colors:

```java
public class Color {
    public static final String RED = "r";
    public static final String GREEN = "g";
    public static final String BLUE = "b";
}
```

When using string constants, you can reference them like this:

```java
String color = ...
if (Color.RED.equals(color)) {
    // TODO:
}
```

Whether you use integer constants or string constants, there is a serious problem when representing a set of enumerated values: the compiler cannot check the validity of each value. For example:

```java
if (weekday == 6 || weekday == 7) {
    if (tasks == Weekday.MON) {
        // TODO:
    }
}
```

The above code will compile and run without errors, but it has two issues:

1. The constants defined in `Weekday` range from 0 to 6, and 7 is not included. The compiler cannot check integer values that are not in the enumeration.
2. Defined constants can still be compared with other variables, even though they are not meant for enumerating weekdays.

Enums
To <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">enable the compiler to automatically check if a value is within a set of enumerated values</mark> and to ensure that different types of enums are not mixed, you can use the `enum` keyword to define enum classes:

```java
// enum
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Weekday day = Weekday.SUN;
        if (day == Weekday.SAT || day == Weekday.SUN) {
            System.out.println("Work at home!");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Work at office!");
        }
    }
}

enum Weekday {
    SUN, MON, TUE, WED, THU, FRI, SAT;
}
```

Notice that enum classes are defined using the `enum` keyword, and you only need to list the constant names. Enum classes have the following advantages over integer or string constants:

1. Enum constants have type information, i.e., `Weekday.SUN` has the type `Weekday`, and the compiler can automatically detect type errors. For example, the following statement will not compile:

```java
int day = 1;
if (day == Weekday.SUN) { // Compile error: bad operand types for binary operator '=='
}
```

2. It's not possible to reference values outside the enum because they cannot be compiled.

3. Enums of different types cannot be compared or assigned to each other due to type mismatch. For example, you cannot assign a `Color` enum value to a `Weekday` enum variable:

```java
Weekday x = Weekday.SUN; // ok!
Weekday y = Color.RED; // Compile error: incompatible types
```

Enum Types
What is the difference between enums defined using `enum` and other classes?

The answer is that there is no significant difference. Enum types are implemented as classes, but they have some unique characteristics:

- Enum types always inherit from `java.lang.Enum` and cannot be extended.
- You can only define instances of the enum, and you cannot create instances using the `new` operator.
- Each enum constant is a globally unique instance of the enum type.
- Enum types can be used in `switch` statements.

For example, consider the `Color` enum class we defined earlier:

```java
public enum Color {
    RED, GREEN, BLUE;
}
```

The compiled `Color` enum class is similar to this:

```java
public final class Color extends Enum { // Inherited from Enum and marked as final class
    public static final Color RED = new Color();
    public static final Color GREEN = new Color();
    public static final Color BLUE = new Color();
    private Color() {} // Private constructor to prevent external instantiation
}
```

So, the compiled enum class is similar to a regular class, but it's required to use the `enum` keyword in Java.

Since enums are classes, each enum constant is an instance of the enum, and they have some methods:

- `name()`: Returns the name of the constant.
- `ordinal()`: Returns the position of the constant in the enum's list.

By default, calling `toString()` on an enum constant will return its name, but you can override `toString()` to provide a custom string representation. For example:

```java
// enum  
public class Main {  
    public static void main(String[] args) {  
        Weekday day = Weekday.SUN;  
        if (day.dayValue == 6 || day.dayValue == 0) {  
            System.out.println("Work at home!");  
        } else {  
            System.out.println("Work at office!");  
        }  
    }  
}  
  
enum Weekday {  
    MON(1, "1"), TUE(2, "2"), WED(3, "3"), THU(4,"4"), FRI(5, "5"), SAT(6, "6"), SUN(0, "6");  
  
    public final int dayValue;  
    private final String chinese;  
  
    private Weekday(int dayValue, String chinese) {  
        this.dayValue = dayValue;  
        this.chinese = chinese;  
    }  
  
    @Override  
    public String toString() {  
        return this.chinese;  
    }  
}
```

It's recommended to use `name()` to check the name of an enum constant, and you should avoid using `toString()` for this purpose.

Switch Statements
Enum classes can be used in `switch` statements because they naturally have type information and a finite number of enum constants. This makes them more suitable for `switch` statements compared to `int` or `String` types:

```java
// switch
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Weekday day = Weekday.SUN;
        switch(day) {
        case MON:
        case TUE:
        case WED:
        case THU:
        case FRI:
            System.out.println("Today is " + day + ". Work at office!");
            break;
        case SAT:
        case SUN:
            System.out.println("Today is " + day + ". Work at home!");
            break;
        default:
            throw new RuntimeException("cannot process " + day);
        }
    }
}

enum Weekday {
    MON, TUE, WED, THU, FRI, SAT, SUN;
}
```
