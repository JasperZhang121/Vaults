```java
public abstract class Shape {
    protected int x;
    protected int y;

    public Shape(int x, int y) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }

    public abstract void draw();
}

public class Circle extends Shape {
    private int radius;

    public Circle(int x, int y, int radius) {
        super(x, y);
        this.radius = radius;
    }

    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a circle at (" + x + "," + y + ") with radius " + radius);
    }
}

public class Square extends Shape {
    private int side;

    public Square(int x, int y, int side) {
        super(x, y);
        this.side = side;
    }

    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a square at (" + x + "," + y + ") with side " + side);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Shape circle = new Circle(10, 10, 5);
        Shape square = new Square(20, 20, 7);

        circle.draw(); // outputs "Drawing a circle at (10,10) with radius 5"
        square.draw(); // outputs "Drawing a square at (20,20) with side 7"
    }
}
```

In this example, we have an abstract class `Shape` that defines two properties `x` and `y` and a method `draw()`. The `draw()` method is abstract, which means that it does not have an implementation in the `Shape` class and must be implemented by any subclass that inherits from `Shape`.

We then create two subclasses of `Shape` - `Circle` and `Square` - which implement their own versions of the `draw()` method.

In the `Main` class, we create an instance of each subclass and call their `draw()` methods. Because `Shape` is abstract and cannot be instantiated, we are forced to use its subclasses to create objects.

This demonstrates how abstraction allows us to create a simplified representation of a complex entity (`Shape`) that defines common properties and behaviors, while leaving the implementation details to the subclasses that inherit from it. It also allows us to treat objects of different classes (`Circle` and `Square`) as if they are of the same type (`Shape`).
