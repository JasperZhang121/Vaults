Files are a crucial means of storage in computer systems. Java's standard library, `java.io`, provides the `File` object to operate on files and directories.

To construct a `File` object, you need to pass in the file path:

```java
import java.io.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        File f = new File("C:\\Windows\\notepad.exe");
        System.out.println(f);
    }
}
```

When constructing a `File` object, you can pass either an absolute path or a relative path. An absolute path is a complete path that starts from the root directory, such as:

```java
File f = new File("C:\\Windows\\notepad.exe");
```

Note that Windows uses `\` as the path separator, and in Java strings, it must be escaped as `\\`. Linux uses `/` as the path separator:

```java
File f = new File("/usr/bin/javac");
```

Relative paths are combined with the current directory to form the absolute path:

```java
// Assuming the current directory is C:\Docs
File f1 = new File("sub\\javac"); // The absolute path is C:\Docs\sub\javac
File f3 = new File(".\\sub\\javac"); // The absolute path is C:\Docs\sub\javac
File f3 = new File("..\\sub\\javac"); // The absolute path is C:\sub\javac
```

`.` represents the current directory, and `..` represents the parent directory.

A `File` object can have three forms of paths: `getPath()` returns the path passed to the constructor, `getAbsolutePath()` returns the absolute path, and `getCanonicalPath()` returns the canonical path, similar to the absolute path but in a standardized form.

What is a canonical path? Consider the following code:

```java
import java.io.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        File f = new File("..");
        System.out.println(f.getPath());
        System.out.println(f.getAbsolutePath());
        System.out.println(f.getCanonicalPath());
    }
}
```

An absolute path can be represented as `C:\Windows\System32\..\notepad.exe`, while the canonical path resolves `.` and `..` to `C:\Windows\notepad.exe`.

Due to differences in path separators between Windows and Linux, the `File` object has a static variable to represent the system's path separator:

```java
System.out.println(File.separator); // Prints "\" or "/" based on the current platform
```

### Files and Directories

`File` objects can represent both files and directories. Importantly, constructing a `File` object doesn't cause any disk operations and won't fail even if the file or directory doesn't exist. Disk operations only occur when certain methods of the `File` object are called.

For example, `isFile()` checks if the `File` object is an existing file, and `isDirectory()` checks if it's an existing directory:

```java
import java.io.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        File f1 = new File("C:\\Windows");
        File f2 = new File("C:\\Windows\\notepad.exe");
        File f3 = new File("C:\\Windows\\nothing");
        System.out.println(f1.isFile());
        System.out.println(f1.isDirectory());
        System.out.println(f2.isFile());
        System.out.println(f2.isDirectory());
        System.out.println(f3.isFile());
        System.out.println(f3.isDirectory());
    }
}
```

When dealing with files, you can further check permissions and size:

- `boolean canRead()`: Check if readable.
- `boolean canWrite()`: Check if writable.
- `boolean canExecute()`: Check if executable.
- `long length()`: File size in bytes.

For directories, being executable means being able to list its files and subdirectories.

### Creating and Deleting Files

When a `File` object represents a file, `createNewFile()` can be used to create a new file, and `delete()` deletes it:

```java
File file = new File("/path/to/file");
if (file.createNewFile()) {
    // File created successfully
    if (file.delete()) {
        // File deleted successfully
    }
}
```

For temporary file operations, `File` provides `createTempFile()` to create a temporary file and `deleteOnExit()` to automatically delete it when the JVM exits.

```java
import java.io.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        File f = File.createTempFile("tmp-", ".txt"); // Provide prefix and suffix
        f.deleteOnExit(); // Automatically delete when JVM exits


        System.out.println(f.isFile());
        System.out.println(f.getAbsolutePath());
    }
}
```

### Traversing Files and Directories

When a `File` object represents a directory, `list()` and `listFiles()` can list files and subdirectories. `listFiles()` offers overloaded methods for filtering unwanted files and directories:

```java
import java.io.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        File f = new File("C:\\Windows");
        File[] fs1 = f.listFiles(); // List all files and subdirectories
        printFiles(fs1);
        File[] fs2 = f.listFiles(new FilenameFilter() { // Only list .exe files
            public boolean accept(File dir, String name) {
                return name.endsWith(".exe"); // Return true to accept the file
            }
        });
        printFiles(fs2);
    }

    static void printFiles(File[] files) {
        System.out.println("==========");
        if (files != null) {
            for (File f : files) {
                System.out.println(f);
            }
        }
        System.out.println("==========");
    }
}
```

Similar to file operations, if a `File` object represents a directory, the following methods can be used to create and delete directories:

- `boolean mkdir()`: Create the directory represented by the current `File` object.
- `boolean mkdirs()`: Create the directory and necessary parent directories.
- `boolean delete()`: Delete the directory; it must be empty to succeed.

### Path

The Java standard library also provides a `Path` object in the `java.nio.file` package. `Path` and `File` are similar, but `Path` operations are simpler:

```java
import java.io.*;
import java.nio.file.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        Path p1 = Paths.get(".", "project", "study"); // Construct a Path object
        System.out.println(p1);
        Path p2 = p1.toAbsolutePath(); // Convert to an absolute path
        System.out.println(p2);
        Path p3 = p2.normalize(); // Convert to a canonical path
        System.out.println(p3);
        File f = p3.toFile(); // Convert to a File object
        System.out.println(f);
        for (Path p : Paths.get("..").toAbsolutePath()) { // Directly iterate through Path
            System.out.println("  " + p);
        }
    }
}
```

`Path` is particularly useful for complex directory operations like concatenation and traversal.
