IoC, short for Inversion of Control, refers to a principle where <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">the control of objects or portions of a program is transferred to a container or framework</mark>. Let's delve into what this means by first understanding how typical Java components cooperate.

Consider an online bookstore that retrieves books through a `BookService`:

```java
public class BookService {
    private HikariConfig config = new HikariConfig();
    private DataSource dataSource = new HikariDataSource(config);

    public Book getBook(long bookId) {
        try (Connection conn = dataSource.getConnection()) {
            ...
            return book;
        }
    }
}
```

To query books from a database, `BookService` holds a `DataSource`. To instantiate a `HikariDataSource`, a `HikariConfig` must be instantiated first.

Similarly, a `UserService` to fetch users would look like this:

```java
public class UserService {
    private HikariConfig config = new HikariConfig();
    private DataSource dataSource = new HikariDataSource(config);

    public User getUser(long userId) {
        try (Connection conn = dataSource.getConnection()) {
            ...
            return user;
        }
    }
}
```

For handling user purchases, `CartServlet` would instantiate both `UserService` and `BookService`:

```java
public class CartServlet extends HttpServlet {
    private BookService bookService = new BookService();
    private UserService userService = new UserService();

    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp) throws ServletException, IOException {
        long currentUserId = getFromCookie(req);
        User currentUser = userService.getUser(currentUserId);
        Book book = bookService.getBook(req.getParameter("bookId"));
        cartService.addToCart(currentUser, book);
        ...
    }
}
```

Each component uses a straightforward method of creation via `new` and retains the instance. However, this method has several disadvantages:

1. Instantiating a component is challenging, such as creating a `HikariDataSource`, which requires configuration reading.
2. There's no need for separate instances of `DataSource` for `BookService` and `UserService`; they could share a single instance. However, determining who creates or retrieves an already created `DataSource` is problematic.
3. Many components need to be destroyed to free resources, such as `DataSource`, but it's difficult to ensure proper destruction when shared among multiple components.
4. Testing components like `BookService` becomes complex because they must operate under actual database conditions.

The core issue then becomes: Who is responsible for creating components? Who assembles them based on dependencies? When destroying, how do you ensure proper sequence based on dependencies?

The solution to these problems lies in IoC. In traditional applications, control flows designed by developers dictate component instantiation. For instance, `CartServlet` creates a `BookService`, which in turn creates a `DataSource`. This pattern has the drawback that a component must know how to correctly create another component.

Under the IoC paradigm, control is inverted from the application to the IoC container. The container handles the creation and configuration of components, so the application only needs to use these pre-configured components. For instance, `BookService` doesn't create a `DataSource` itself but waits for an external method like `setDataSource()` to inject it:

```java
public class BookService {
    private DataSource dataSource;

    public void setDataSource(DataSource dataSource) {
        this.dataSource = dataSource;
    }
}
```

Such a minor change yields substantial benefits:

- `BookService` no longer concerns itself with how to create a `DataSource`, thus no need to handle database configuration code.
- Sharing a `DataSource` instance becomes simple, and testing `BookService` is easier using an in-memory database instead of a real MySQL setup.

Thus, IoC is also known as Dependency Injection (DI), addressing the primary issue: separating component creation and configuration from their use, with the IoC container managing component lifecycles.

For IoC container configuration, one common method is through XML files, where the container is instructed on component creation and their dependencies, like this:

```xml
<beans>
    <bean id="dataSource" class="HikariDataSource" />
    <bean id="bookService" class="BookService">
        <property name="dataSource" ref="dataSource" />
    </bean>
    <bean id="userService" class="UserService">
        <property name="dataSource" ref="dataSource" />
    </bean>
</beans>
```

In Spring's IoC container, all components are referred to as JavaBeans. Dependency injection can occur via setter methods or constructors, and Spring supports both methods along with their mix.

Design-wise, Spring's IoC container is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">highly scalable and non-intrusive</mark>, meaning application components do not need to implement Spring-specific interfaces or even be aware of running within a Spring container. This design enhances flexibility, allowing components to be tested independently of Spring, significantly boosting development efficiency.
