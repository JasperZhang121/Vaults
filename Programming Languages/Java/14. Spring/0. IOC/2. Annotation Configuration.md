#### XML Configuration Approach

In Spring's IoC (Inversion of Control) container, we typically describe the dependencies of our Beans using configuration files like XML. The container then creates and assembles the Beans based on this configuration. Once the container is initialized, we can retrieve Beans directly from it and use them in our application.

Using XML configuration has its advantages—primarily, it provides a <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">clear overview of all Beans</mark>, with their dependencies visible at a glance. However, this approach can become cumbersome as the application grows. Every time a new component is added, the corresponding Bean must be explicitly defined in the XML configuration file, leading to a lot of repetitive and verbose code.

#### Transitioning to Annotation Configuration

Let’s modify an existing example by removing the XML configuration and adding a few annotations to the `UserService` and `MailService` classes.

First, we annotate the `MailService` class with `@Component`:

```java
@Component
public class MailService {
    // Implementation details
}
```

The `@Component` annotation is equivalent to defining a Bean in XML. It automatically registers the class as a Bean with the default name derived from the class name (e.g., `mailService`).

Next, we annotate the `UserService` class with both `@Component` and `@Autowired`:

```java
@Component
public class UserService {
    @Autowired
    private MailService mailService;

    // Other implementation details
}
```

The `@Autowired` annotation is used to inject the `MailService` Bean into the `UserService`. Compared to XML configuration, `@Autowired` simplifies dependency injection. It can be placed on fields, setters, or constructors, allowing for greater flexibility:

```java
@Component
public class UserService {
    private final MailService mailService;

    @Autowired
    public UserService(MailService mailService) {
        this.mailService = mailService;
    }

    // Other implementation details
}
```

Typically, we use `@Autowired` on fields, which is often the easiest approach for testing.

#### Starting the Spring Container

Finally, we need to create a configuration class, `AppConfig`, to initialize the Spring container:

```java
@Configuration
@ComponentScan
public class AppConfig {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ApplicationContext context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(AppConfig.class);
        UserService userService = context.getBean(UserService.class);
        User user = userService.login("bob@example.com", "password");
        System.out.println(user.getName());
    }
}
```

Here, `AppConfig` is annotated with `@Configuration`, marking it as a configuration class. When we create the `ApplicationContext`:

```java
ApplicationContext context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(AppConfig.class);
```

We use the `AnnotationConfigApplicationContext` class, which requires a class annotated with `@Configuration`.

The `@ComponentScan` annotation on `AppConfig` tells Spring to automatically scan the current package and its sub-packages for classes annotated with `@Component`, creating and assembling Beans accordingly.

#### Project Structure

The overall project structure after moving to Annotation configuration looks like this:

```
spring-ioc-annoconfig
├── pom.xml
└── src
    └── main
        └── java
            └── com
                └── jasper
                    └── learnjava
                        ├── AppConfig.java
                        └── service
                            ├── MailService.java
                            ├── User.java
                            └── UserService.java
```

#### Conclusion

Using Annotations with automatic scanning simplifies Spring configuration significantly. The key steps to follow are:

1. Annotate each Bean with `@Component` and inject dependencies with `@Autowired`.
2. Ensure the configuration class is annotated with `@Configuration` and `@ComponentScan`.
3. Keep all Beans within the specified package and sub-packages for efficient scanning.

While `@ComponentScan` is convenient, it's crucial to maintain a well-organized package structure. Typically, the configuration class (e.g., `AppConfig`) resides in a top-level package, with Beans organized into sub-packages for clarity and maintainability.
