In Java applications, it is common to read configuration files or resource files. When using the Spring container, we can also inject files directly into the application, simplifying the process of file handling.

For example, suppose `AppService` needs to read a file named `logo.txt`. Typically, this would involve writing a lot of boilerplate code to locate the file and open an `InputStream`.

Spring provides the `org.springframework.core.io.Resource` interface (note: not `jakarta.annotation.Resource` or `javax.annotation.Resource`), which can be injected with `@Value` just like a `String` or `int`:

```java
@Component
public class AppService {
    @Value("classpath:/logo.txt")
    private Resource resource;

    private String logo;

    @PostConstruct
    public void init() throws IOException {
        try (var reader = new BufferedReader(
                new InputStreamReader(resource.getInputStream(), StandardCharsets.UTF_8))) {
            this.logo = reader.lines().collect(Collectors.joining("\n"));
        }
    }
}
```

The most common way to inject a `Resource` is through the classpath. For example, `classpath:/logo.txt` specifies that the `logo.txt` file should be searched within the classpath. The `Resource.getInputStream()` method provides an input stream, avoiding the need for custom file-searching code.

You can also specify the file path directly, such as:

```java
@Value("file:/path/to/logo.txt")
private Resource resource;
```

However, using the classpath is usually the simplest approach. The project structure for the above example is as follows:

```
spring-ioc-resource
├── pom.xml
└── src
    └── main
        ├── java
        │   └── com
        │       └── itranswarp
        │           └── learnjava
        │               ├── AppConfig.java
        │               └── AppService.java
        └── resources
            └── logo.txt
```

With Maven's standard directory structure, all resource files can be placed in the `src/main/resources` directory.
