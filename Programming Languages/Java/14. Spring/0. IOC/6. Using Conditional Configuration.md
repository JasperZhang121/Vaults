When developing applications, it's common to adapt to different environments, such as using an in-memory database during development for quick startup and a MySQL database in production. An application that can automatically adapt to its environment is more flexible.

Spring provides the concept of **Profiles** to represent different environments, such as:

- `native` (development)
- `test`
- `production`

#### Using `@Profile`

You can configure Spring to create Beans conditionally based on the active profile. For example:

```java
@Configuration
@ComponentScan
public class AppConfig {
    @Bean
    @Profile("!test")
    ZoneId createZoneId() {
        return ZoneId.systemDefault();
    }

    @Bean
    @Profile("test")
    ZoneId createZoneIdForTest() {
        return ZoneId.of("America/New_York");
    }
}
```

If the current profile is `test`, Spring will call `createZoneIdForTest()` to create the `ZoneId`. Otherwise, it will call `createZoneId()`. Note that `@Profile("!test")` means "not in the `test` environment."

To specify the profile when running the application, use the JVM parameter:

```bash
-Dspring.profiles.active=test
```

This sets the active profile to `test`.

You can also specify multiple profiles:

```bash
-Dspring.profiles.active=test,master
```

This example represents the `test` environment and uses the `master` branch of the code.

To match multiple profiles, you can use an array:

```java
@Bean
@Profile({ "test", "master" }) // Matches either "test" or "master"
ZoneId createZoneId() {
    ...
}
```

#### Using `@Conditional`

In addition to `@Profile`, Spring allows the use of `@Conditional` to decide whether to create a Bean based on custom conditions.

For example, consider the following annotation on a `SmtpMailService` class:

```java
@Component
@Conditional(OnSmtpEnvCondition.class)
public class SmtpMailService implements MailService {
    ...
}
```

This means `SmtpMailService` will only be created if the condition defined in `OnSmtpEnvCondition` is satisfied. The condition logic is as follows:

```java
public class OnSmtpEnvCondition implements Condition {
    public boolean matches(ConditionContext context, AnnotatedTypeMetadata metadata) {
        return "true".equalsIgnoreCase(System.getenv("smtp"));
    }
}
```

In this case, the Bean is created only if the environment variable `smtp` exists and its value is `true`. This allows environment variables to control whether `SmtpMailService` is created.

Spring provides the `@Conditional` annotation, but the condition logic must be implemented manually.

#### Conditional Annotations in Spring Boot

Spring Boot extends `@Conditional` with several easier-to-use annotations. For example:

- **Based on a property in the configuration file:**

```java
@Component
@ConditionalOnProperty(name = "app.smtp", havingValue = "true")
public class MailService {
    ...
}
```

The `MailService` Bean is created if the property `app.smtp=true` exists.

- **Based on the presence of a class in the classpath:**

```java
@Component
@ConditionalOnClass(name = "javax.mail.Transport")
public class MailService {
    ...
}
```

The `MailService` Bean is created if the class `javax.mail.Transport` is available in the classpath.

#### Example: File Storage

Suppose you need to store user-uploaded images and return their storage path. During local development, files are stored on the filesystem:

```java
@Component
@ConditionalOnProperty(name = "app.storage", havingValue = "file", matchIfMissing = true)
public class FileUploader implements Uploader {
    ...
}
```

In production, files are stored on AWS S3:

```java
@Component
@ConditionalOnProperty(name = "app.storage", havingValue = "s3")
public class S3Uploader implements Uploader {
    ...
}
```

The dependent service can inject the appropriate `Uploader`:

```java
@Component
public class UserImageService {
    @Autowired
    Uploader uploader;
}
```

If the configuration file specifies `app.storage=s3`, `S3Uploader` is automatically used. If the configuration specifies `app.storage=file` or does not include `app.storage`, `FileUploader` is used by default.

#### Benefits of Conditional Annotations

Using conditional annotations allows for flexible and dynamic Bean assembly, making your application more adaptable to different environments.
