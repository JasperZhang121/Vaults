In AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming), we often encounter the following concepts:

- **Aspect**: A cross-cutting concern that spans multiple core logic areas, such as system concerns like logging.
- **Joinpoint**: A specific point in the program execution where an aspect can be applied.
- **Pointcut**: A collection of joinpoints where advice is applied.
- **Advice**: The action taken at a specific joinpoint.
- **Introduction**: Dynamically adding new interfaces to an existing Java object.
- **Weaving**: Integrating aspects into the program's execution flow.
- **Interceptor**: A mechanism to implement advice.
- **Target Object**: The original object containing the core business logic.
- **AOP Proxy**: The enhanced object reference held by the client.

These terms might initially seem overwhelming, but AOP is essentially a proxy pattern implementation. With Spring, implementing AOP becomes remarkably straightforward.

### Example: Logging for `UserService` and `MailService`

Suppose we want to:

- Add a log before every method of `UserService`.
- Add logs before and after every method of `MailService`.

In Spring, this can be achieved as follows:

#### Step 1: Add Spring AOP Dependency

Include the following Maven dependency for Spring AOP support:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-aspects</artifactId>
    <version>6.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

This dependency automatically includes AspectJ for easier AOP implementation.

#### Step 2: Define the `LoggingAspect`

Create a logging aspect using AspectJ annotations:

```java
@Aspect
@Component
public class LoggingAspect {
    // Log before every method in UserService:
    @Before("execution(public * com.example.service.UserService.*(..))")
    public void doAccessCheck() {
        System.err.println("[Before] Performing access check...");
    }

    // Log before and after every method in MailService:
    @Around("execution(public * com.example.service.MailService.*(..))")
    public Object doLogging(ProceedingJoinPoint pjp) throws Throwable {
        System.err.println("[Around] Start " + pjp.getSignature());
        Object retVal = pjp.proceed();
        System.err.println("[Around] Done " + pjp.getSignature());
        return retVal;
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The `@Before` annotation in `doAccessCheck()` specifies that the method should execute before every public method in `UserService`. The `execution` syntax defines the applicable methods.
- The `@Around` annotation in `doLogging()` allows complete control over method execution. It logs before and after invoking the target method (`pjp.proceed()`).

Marking the class with both `@Aspect` and `@Component` indicates it is an aspect and a Spring-managed Bean.

#### Step 3: Enable AspectJ Auto Proxy

Add the `@EnableAspectJAutoProxy` annotation in the configuration class:

```java
@Configuration
@ComponentScan
@EnableAspectJAutoProxy
public class AppConfig {
    ...
}
```

This tells Spring's IoC container to look for Beans annotated with `@Aspect` and apply AOP based on annotations like `@Before` and `@Around`.

#### Output Example

Running the application produces the following output:

```text
[Before] Performing access check...
[Around] Start void com.example.service.MailService.sendRegistrationMail(User)
Welcome, test!
[Around] Done void com.example.service.MailService.sendRegistrationMail(User)
[Before] Performing access check...
[Around] Start void com.example.service.MailService.sendLoginMail(User)
Hi, Bob! You are logged in at 2020-02-14T23:13:52.167996+08:00[Asia/Shanghai]
[Around] Done void com.example.service.MailService.sendLoginMail(User)
```

This demonstrates that the logging aspect (`LoggingAspect`) executes correctly before and after the business logic.

### AOP Implementation Details

The AOP mechanism is based on dynamic proxies. For example, `LoggingAspect.doAccessCheck()` is injected into every public method of `UserService` through proxy classes like this:

```java
public class UserServiceAopProxy extends UserService {
    private UserService target;
    private LoggingAspect aspect;

    public UserServiceAopProxy(UserService target, LoggingAspect aspect) {
        this.target = target;
        this.aspect = aspect;
    }

    public User login(String email, String password) {
        // Execute aspect logic:
        aspect.doAccessCheck();
        // Delegate to the original UserService logic:
        return target.login(email, password);
    }

    public User register(String email, String password, String name) {
        aspect.doAccessCheck();
        return target.register(email, password, name);
    }

    ...
}
```

Spring creates these proxies dynamically during container initialization using **CGLIB** (for classes) or **JDK dynamic proxies** (for interfaces). For example, the `UserService` instance from Spring might appear as `UserService$$EnhancerBySpringCGLIB$$1f44e01c`.

**Note**: If a Beanâ€™s class is `final`, Spring cannot create a proxy subclass.

### Steps to Use AOP in Spring

1. Define advice methods with AspectJ annotations (`@Before`, `@Around`, etc.).
2. Annotate the aspect class with `@Aspect` and `@Component`.
3. Enable AspectJ auto-proxying with `@EnableAspectJAutoProxy`.

### Types of Interceptors

1. **`@Before`**: Executes before the target method. If an exception is thrown, the target method is not executed.
2. **`@After`**: Executes after the target method, regardless of whether it throws an exception.
3. **`@AfterReturning`**: Executes only if the target method completes successfully.
4. **`@AfterThrowing`**: Executes only if the target method throws an exception.
5. **`@Around`**: Provides full control over method execution. You can execute logic before, after, or instead of the target method.

Spring simplifies AOP by automating much of the complexity, making it an efficient tool for cross-cutting concerns like logging, security, and transaction management.
