When using AOP, whether through AspectJ syntax or annotations, the essence of AOP is to let Spring automatically create a **proxy**. This proxy allows the caller to transparently invoke methods while dynamically "weaving" additional logic at runtime. Fundamentally, AOP is an implementation of the **proxy design pattern**.

Spring uses **CGLIB** to dynamically create proxies at runtime. Without a solid understanding of its mechanism, developers may encounter various perplexing issues.

### Example: AOP Pitfall in `UserService`

Consider the following `UserService` class:

```java
@Component
public class UserService {
    // Member variable:
    public final ZoneId zoneId = ZoneId.systemDefault();

    // Constructor:
    public UserService() {
        System.out.println("UserService(): init...");
        System.out.println("UserService(): zoneId = " + this.zoneId);
    }

    // Public method:
    public ZoneId getZoneId() {
        return zoneId;
    }

    // Public final method:
    public final ZoneId getFinalZoneId() {
        return zoneId;
    }
}
```

We inject this `UserService` into `MailService`:

```java
@Component
public class MailService {
    @Autowired
    UserService userService;

    public String sendMail() {
        ZoneId zoneId = userService.zoneId;
        String dt = ZonedDateTime.now(zoneId).toString();
        return "Hello, it is " + dt;
    }
}
```

Now, run the application:

```java
@Configuration
@ComponentScan
public class AppConfig {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ApplicationContext context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(AppConfig.class);
        MailService mailService = context.getBean(MailService.class);
        System.out.println(mailService.sendMail());
    }
}
```

The output is as expected:

```text
UserService(): init...
UserService(): zoneId = Asia/Shanghai
Hello, it is 2020-04-12T10:23:22.917721+08:00[Asia/Shanghai]
```

#### Adding AOP

Now, we add a simple `LoggingAspect`:

```java
@Aspect
@Component
public class LoggingAspect {
    @Before("execution(public * com..*.UserService.*(..))")
    public void doAccessCheck() {
        System.err.println("[Before] Performing access check...");
    }
}
```

Don’t forget to add `@EnableAspectJAutoProxy` to `AppConfig`. When we rerun the application, it throws a `NullPointerException`:

```text
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NullPointerException: zone
    at ...
```

The issue lies in this line within `MailService`:

```java
ZoneId zoneId = userService.zoneId; // zoneId is null!
```

### Cause of the Issue

With AOP enabled, Spring replaces the `UserService` Bean with a **proxy** created using **CGLIB**. Here's what happens:

1. **Original Instance Creation**: Spring creates the original `UserService` instance by invoking its constructor. This behaves as expected, and the `zoneId` field is initialized.
2. **Proxy Creation**: Spring creates a CGLIB proxy class that extends `UserService`:

```java
public class UserService$$EnhancerBySpringCGLIB extends UserService {
    UserService target;    // Reference to the original UserService instance
    LoggingAspect aspect; // Reference to the LoggingAspect

    public UserService$$EnhancerBySpringCGLIB() {
    }

    public ZoneId getZoneId() {
        aspect.doAccessCheck();
        return target.getZoneId();
    }
}
```

The key point is that the proxy class **inherits `zoneId`** but does not initialize it. This happens because the proxy’s purpose is to override methods, not to replicate the original instance's state.

---

### Why Is `zoneId` Null?

The `zoneId` field is initialized in the original `UserService` instance during its constructor execution:

```java
public class UserService {
    public final ZoneId zoneId = ZoneId.systemDefault();

    public UserService() {
        super();
        zoneId = ZoneId.systemDefault();
    }
}
```

However, for the proxy class (`UserService$$EnhancerBySpringCGLIB`), the `super()` constructor is not called, and therefore, the `zoneId` field is never initialized.

Since `MailService` references the proxy instead of the original instance, accessing `zoneId` results in `null`.

### Solution: Use Method Accessors

To avoid this issue, always access fields through getter methods rather than directly accessing them:

```java
@Component
public class MailService {
    @Autowired
    UserService userService;

    public String sendMail() {
        // Use the getter method instead of direct field access:
        ZoneId zoneId = userService.getZoneId();
        ...
    }
}
```

This ensures that whether `UserService` is proxied or not, the `getZoneId()` method will work as expected. The proxy will delegate the method call to the original `UserService` instance.

### The Final Trap: `final` Methods

If the `UserService` class includes a `final` method:

```java
@Component
public class UserService {
    public final ZoneId getFinalZoneId() {
        return zoneId;
    }
}
```

Calling this method in `MailService` will still result in a `NullPointerException`. This happens because **CGLIB cannot override `final` methods**. Therefore, the proxy class cannot delegate the call to the original instance, and the proxy’s uninitialized `zoneId` field is returned.

When Spring detects such methods, it logs a warning:

```text
DEBUG org.springframework.aop.framework.CglibAopProxy - Final method 
[public final java.time.ZoneId xxx.UserService.getFinalZoneId()] cannot get proxied via CGLIB:
Calls to this method will NOT be routed to the target instance and might lead to NPEs against uninitialized fields in the proxy instance.
```

### AOP Pitfall Guide

1. **Always Use Getter Methods**: Access injected Beans through their methods instead of directly accessing fields.
2. **Avoid `final` Methods in Beans**: Do not write `public final` methods in Beans that might be proxied.

By following these guidelines, your code will behave correctly, with or without AOP enabled.
