### Shared resources and their problems

In a multithreaded program, multiple threads may access the same resources concurrently. This can lead to several problems, such as race conditions, deadlocks, and thread interference.

### Synchronization in Java

Synchronization is the process of controlling access to shared resources in a multithreaded program. In Java, synchronization can be achieved using the synchronized keyword or using locks.

Here is an example of using the synchronized keyword:

```java
public class Counter {
    private int count;

    public synchronized void increment() {
        count++;
    }

    public synchronized int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}
```

Here is an example of using locks:

```java
public class Counter {
    private int count;
    private Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();

    public void increment() {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            count++;
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }

    public int getCount() {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            return count;
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }
}
```
