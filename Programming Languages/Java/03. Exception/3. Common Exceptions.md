The Java Standard Library defines several commonly used exceptions as follows:

- Exception
  - RuntimeException
    - NullPointerException
    - IndexOutOfBoundsException
    - SecurityException
    - IllegalArgumentException
      - NumberFormatException
  - IOException
    - UnsupportedCharsetException
    - FileNotFoundException
    - SocketException
  - ParseException
  - GeneralSecurityException
  - SQLException
  - TimeoutException

When throwing exceptions in the code, it's advisable to use the exception types already defined in the JDK. For example, if a parameter check is invalid, an `IllegalArgumentException` should be thrown:

```java
static void process1(int age) {
    if (age <= 0) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException();
    }
}
```

In a large project, it's possible to define new types of exceptions, but maintaining a reasonable exception inheritance hierarchy is very important.

A common practice is to define a `BaseException` as the "root exception" and then derive various business-specific exceptions from it.

`BaseException` should be derived from a suitable `Exception`, usually recommended to be derived from `RuntimeException`:

```java
public class BaseException extends RuntimeException {
}
```

Other business-specific exceptions can then be derived from `BaseException`:

```java
public class UserNotFoundException extends BaseException {
}

public class LoginFailedException extends BaseException {
}

// ...
```

The custom `BaseException` should provide multiple constructors:

```java
public class BaseException extends RuntimeException {
    public BaseException() {
        super();
    }

    public BaseException(String message, Throwable cause) {
        super(message, cause);
    }

    public BaseException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }

    public BaseException(Throwable cause) {
        super(cause);
    }
}
```

The above constructors are actually copied as is from `RuntimeException`. This way, when throwing an exception, you can choose the appropriate constructor. IDEs can be used to quickly generate constructors for subclasses based on the superclass.
