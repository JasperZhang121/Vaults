Among all `RuntimeException` exceptions, the one most familiar to Java programmers is probably `NullPointerException`, commonly known as NPE. It occurs when a method is called or a field is accessed on a `null` object. This exception is usually thrown by the JVM. For example:

```java
// NullPointerException
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String s = null;
        System.out.println(s.toLowerCase());
    }
}
```

The concept of a pointer originates from C language. In Java, there are no pointers as such; what we define as variables are actually references. So, a "Null Pointer" is more accurately a "Null Reference," although the distinction is not significant.

### **Handling NullPointerException**

How should we deal with `NullPointerException`? First and foremost, it's important to understand that `NullPointerException` is a logical error in the code. When encountering `NullPointerException`, the principle should be to expose and fix it early. It's crucial not to hide such coding errors with a `catch` block:

```java
// Bad example: Catching NullPointerException
try {
    transferMoney(from, to, amount);
} catch (NullPointerException e) {
}
```

Good coding practices can greatly reduce the occurrence of `NullPointerException`. For example:

- Initialize member variables when defining them:

    ```java
    public class Person {
        private String name = "";
    }
    ```

    Using an empty string `""` instead of `null` can avoid many `NullPointerExceptions`. In business logic, using an empty string `""` to represent "not filled" is much safer than `null`.

- Return an empty string `""` or empty array instead of `null`:

    ```java
    public String[] readLinesFromFile(String file) {
        if (getFileSize(file) == 0) {
            // Return an empty array instead of null:
            return new String[0];
        }
        ...
    }
    ```

    This approach ensures that the caller does not need to check if the result is `null`.

- If the calling code must determine results based on `null` (e.g., `null` indicates the file does not exist), consider returning `Optional<T>`:

    ```java
    public Optional<String> readFromFile(String file) {
        if (!fileExist(file)) {
            return Optional.empty();
        }
        ...
    }
    ```

    In this case, the caller must check for the presence of a result using `Optional.isPresent()`.

### **Locating NullPointerException**

If a `NullPointerException` occurs, for example, when calling `a.b.c.x()`, the possible reasons could be:

- `a` is `null`.
- `a.b` is `null`.
- `a.b.c` is `null`.

Before Java 14, pinpointing which object was `null` could only be done by logging statements like:

```java
System.out.println(a);
System.out.println(a.b);
System.out.println(a.b.c);
```

Starting with Java 14, if a `NullPointerException` occurs, the JVM can provide detailed information about which object is `null`. For example:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person p = new Person();
        System.out.println(p.address.city.toLowerCase());
    }
}

class Person {
    String[] name = new String[2];
    Address address = new Address();
}

class Address {
    String city;
    String street;
    String zipcode;
}
```

In the detailed information of `NullPointerException`, you can see messages like `... because "<local1>.address.city" is null`, meaning the `city` field is `null`, which helps to quickly locate the problem.

This enhanced `NullPointerException` information is a new feature in Java 14, but it is disabled by default. It can be enabled with the `-XX:+ShowCodeDetailsInExceptionMessages` JVM argument:

```bash
java -XX:+ShowCodeDetailsInExceptionMessages Main.java
```
