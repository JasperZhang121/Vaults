During the running process of a computer program, various kinds of errors always occur.

Some errors are caused by users. For example, the program expects the user to input an age of type `int`, but the input is `abc`:

```java
// Assuming the user input is 'abc':
String s = "abc";
int n = Integer.parseInt(s); // NumberFormatException!
```
The program wants to read and write the content of a file, but the user has deleted it:

```java
// The user deleted the file:
String t = readFile("C:\\abc.txt"); // FileNotFoundException!
```
There are also errors that occur randomly and can never be avoided. For instance:

- The network suddenly disconnects, losing connection to a remote server.
- Memory is exhausted, causing the program to crash.
- The user clicks “print”, but there is no printer connected.
- … and more.

Therefore, a robust program must handle a variety of errors.

The so-called error means that when a program calls a certain function, if it fails, it is considered an error.

How does the caller get information about a failed call? There are two methods:

Method One: Agree on returning an error code.

For example, when processing a file, if it returns 0, it means success; other integers represent agreed-upon error codes:

```java
int code = processFile("C:\\test.txt");
if (code == 0) {
    // ok:
} else {
    // error:
    switch (code) {
    case 1:
        // file not found:
    case 2:
        // no read permission:
    default:
        // unknown error:
    }
}
```
Because the error code is of type `int`, it is very cumbersome to handle. This method is common in low-level C functions.

Method Two: Provide an exception handling mechanism at the language level.

Java has a built-in exception handling mechanism and always uses exceptions to represent errors.

An exception is a kind of class, so it carries type information itself. An exception can be thrown anywhere, but only needs to be caught at a higher level, separating it from method calls:

```java
try {
    String s = processFile("C:\\test.txt");
    // ok:
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
    // file not found:
} catch (SecurityException e) {
    // no read permission:
} catch (IOException e) {
    // io error:
} catch (Exception e) {
    // other error:
}
```
Because Java's exceptions are classes, their inheritance relationship is as follows:

```
                     ┌───────────┐
                     │  Object   │
                     └───────────┘
                           ▲
                           │
                     ┌───────────┐
                     │ Throwable │
                     └───────────┘
                           ▲
                 ┌─────────┴─────────┐
                 │                   │
           ┌───────────┐       ┌───────────┐
           │   Error   │       │ Exception │
           └───────────┘       └───────────┘
                 ▲                   ▲
         ┌───────┘              ┌────┴──────────┐
         │                      │               │
┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐┌───────────┐

└─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘└───────────┘
                                ▲
                    ┌───────────┴─────────────┐
                    │                         │
         ┌─────────────────────┐ ┌─────────────────────────┐
         │NullPointerException │ │IllegalArgumentException │...
         └─────────────────────┘ └─────────────────────────┘
```
From the inheritance relationship, we can see that `Throwable` is the root of the exception hierarchy, inheriting from `Object`. `Throwable` has two branches: `Error` and `Exception`. `Error` indicates serious problems that the program generally cannot handle, such as:

- `OutOfMemoryError`: Out of memory
- `NoClassDefFoundError`: Unable to load a Class
- `StackOverflowError`: Stack overflow

`Exception`, on the other hand, represents errors during runtime that can be caught and handled.

Some exceptions are part of application logic processing and should be caught and handled. For example:

- `NumberFormatException`: Incorrect format for numeric types
- `FileNotFoundException`: File not found
- `SocketException`: Network read failure

Some exceptions are caused by incorrect program logic and should be fixed in the program itself. For example:

- `NullPointerException`: Calling a method or accessing a field on a `null` object
- `IndexOutOfBoundsException`: Array index out of bounds

Exceptions are divided into two major

 categories:

- `RuntimeException` and its subclasses;
- Non-`RuntimeException` (including `IOException`, `ReflectiveOperationException`, etc.)

Java stipulates:

- Checked Exceptions must be caught or declared to be thrown. These include `Exception` and its subclasses, but not `RuntimeException` and its subclasses.
- Unchecked Exceptions, including `Error` and its subclasses, and `RuntimeException` and its subclasses, do not need to be caught.

Note: The compiler not requiring `RuntimeException` and its subclasses to be caught does not mean that the application itself should not catch and handle `RuntimeException`. Whether to catch it depends on the specific situation.

### **Catching Exceptions**

Catching exceptions is done using the `try...catch` statement. Place the code that might cause an exception in the `try {...}` block, and then use `catch` to capture the corresponding `Exception` and its subclasses:

```java
// try...catch
import java.io.UnsupportedEncodingException;
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        byte[] bs = toGBK("中文");
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(bs));
    }

    static byte[] toGBK(String s) {
        try {
            // Convert String to byte[] with specified encoding:
            return s.getBytes("GBK");
        } catch (UnsupportedEncodingException e) {
            // Catch UnsupportedEncodingException if the system does not support the GBK encoding:
            System.out.println(e); // Print exception information
            return s.getBytes(); // Try using the default encoding
        }
    }
}
```

If we don't catch `UnsupportedEncodingException`, there will be a compilation failure:

```java
// try...catch
import java.io.UnsupportedEncodingException;
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        byte[] bs = toGBK("中文");
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(bs));
    }

    static byte[] toGBK(String s) {
        return s.getBytes("GBK");
    }
}
```

The compiler will report an error, indicating the need to catch `UnsupportedEncodingException`.

This is because the method `String.getBytes(String)` is defined as:

```java
public byte[] getBytes(String charsetName) throws UnsupportedEncodingException {
    ...
}
```

When a method is defined with `throws Xxx`, it indicates the types of exceptions that the method might throw. The caller must catch these exceptions, or the compiler will report an error.

In the `toGBK()` method, since `String.getBytes(String)` is called, `UnsupportedEncodingException` must be caught. Alternatively, we can declare in the method definition that `toGBK()` might throw `UnsupportedEncodingException`, allowing it to pass the compiler check:

```java
// try...catch
import java.io.UnsupportedEncodingException;
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        byte[] bs = toGBK("中文");
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(bs));
    }

    static byte[] toGBK(String s) throws UnsupportedEncodingException {
        return s.getBytes("GBK");
    }
}
```

However, this code will still result in a compilation error. The compiler now points out the issue at `byte[] bs = toGBK("中文");`. It's because in the `main()` method, when calling `toGBK()`, the potential `UnsupportedEncodingException` is not caught.

The solution is to catch the exception in the `main()` method and handle it:

```java
// try...catch
import java.io.UnsupportedEncodingException;
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            byte[] bs = toGBK("中文");
            System.out.println(Arrays.toString(bs));
        } catch (UnsupportedEncodingException e) {
            System.out.println(e);
        }
    }

    static byte[] toGBK(String s) throws UnsupportedEncodingException {
        // Convert String to byte[] with specified encoding:
        return s.getBytes("GBK");
    }
}
```

Thus, any Checked Exception declared in a method must either be caught or declared at a higher calling level. All uncaught exceptions must ultimately be caught in the `main()` method. This is ensured by the compiler. The `main()` method is also the last chance to catch an Exception.

For testing code, the above method might be a bit cumbersome. If you don't want to write any `try` code, you can directly define the `main()` method as `throws Exception`:

```java
// try...catch
import java.io.UnsupportedEncodingException;
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        byte[] bs = toGBK("中文");
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(bs));
    }

    static byte[] toGBK(String s) throws UnsupportedEncodingException {
        // Convert String to byte[] with specified encoding:
        return s.getBytes("GBK");
    }
}
```

Because `main()` declares that it may throw an `Exception`, it also declares that it may throw all kinds of `Exceptions`, so there's no need to catch them internally. The cost is that if an exception occurs, the program will immediately exit.

Some might prefer to "swallow" the exception inside `toGBK()`:

```java
static byte[] toGBK(String s) {
    try {
        return s.getBytes("GBK");
    } catch (UnsupportedEncodingException e) {
        // Do nothing
    }
    return null;
}
```

This method of catching without handling the exception is very bad practice. Even if there's really nothing you can do

, you should at least log the exception:

```java
static byte[] toGBK(String s) {
    try {
        return s.getBytes("GBK");
    } catch (UnsupportedEncodingException e) {
        // Log it first:
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
    return null;
}
```

All exceptions can call `printStackTrace()` to print the exception stack, which is a simple and useful method for quickly printing exceptions.
