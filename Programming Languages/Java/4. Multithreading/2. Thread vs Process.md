In Java, both threads and processes can be used for concurrent programming. Threads are lightweight and share the same memory space, while processes are heavyweight and have separate memory spaces. Here are some differences between threads and processes:

-   Threads are used for lightweight tasks that can be performed concurrently within the same process, while processes are used for heavyweight tasks that require separate memory spaces.
-   Threads share the same memory space and resources, while processes have separate memory spaces and resources.
-   Threads are more efficient than processes because they have lower overhead and consume fewer system resources.

Here is an example of using threads in Java:

```java
public class MyThread extends Thread {
   public void run() {
      // code to be executed in this thread
   }

   public static void main(String args[]) {
      MyThread thread1 = new MyThread();
      MyThread thread2 = new MyThread();

      thread1.start();
      thread2.start();
   }
}
```

In this example, we define a class `MyThread` that extends the `Thread` class and overrides its `run` method. The `run` method contains the code to be executed in the thread. We then create two instances of `MyThread` and start them using the `start` method.

Here is an example of using processes in Java:

```java
public class MyProcess {
   public static void main(String args[]) throws Exception {
      Process process1 = Runtime.getRuntime().exec("my_command arg1 arg2");
      Process process2 = Runtime.getRuntime().exec("my_command arg3 arg4");

      process1.waitFor();
      process2.waitFor();
   }
}
```

In this example, we use the `Runtime.getRuntime().exec` method to execute two separate processes. We pass the command and arguments as a string parameter to the `exec` method. We then use the `waitFor` method to wait for the processes to complete before continuing with the program execution.

### Thread methods:

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `start()` | Starts the thread, calling the `run()` method. |
| `run()` | The code that will be executed in the thread. |
| `sleep(long millis)` | Causes the thread to sleep for the specified number of milliseconds. |
| `join()` | Waits for the thread to die. |
| `isAlive()` | Returns `true` if the thread is still alive. |
| `interrupt()` | Interrupts the thread, causing it to throw an `InterruptedException` at the next available opportunity. |
| `yield()` | Temporarily gives up the CPU to other threads. |
| `setName(String name)` | Sets the name of the thread. |
| `getName()` | Returns the name of the thread. |
| `setPriority(int priority)` | Sets the priority of the thread. |
| `getPriority()` | Returns the priority of the thread. |
