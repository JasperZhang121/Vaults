In network application development, the concept of a Socket is frequently encountered. A Socket is an abstraction through which an application establishes remote connections, with the underlying TCP/IP protocol managing data transmission across the network.

**Why Sockets?**  
Communicating solely via IP addresses is insufficient, as a computer typically runs multiple network applications simultaneously, like web browsers, chat clients, and email clients. The operating system, therefore, cannot determine the appropriate application for incoming data without additional information. Sockets help in identifying the application through the combination of IP address and port number, allowing the correct routing of data to the intended application.

**Socket Composition:**
A Socket comprises an IP address and a port number (ranging from 0 to 65535). Ports below 1024 are privileged and require administrator rights, while ports above 1024 are available for general applications.

**Server and Client Model in TCP:**  
In TCP programming, one process acts as the server, listening on a specific port, while another acts as the client, initiating a connection to the server's IP address and port. Successful connection establishment leads to the formation of a TCP link, enabling bidirectional data transmission.

**Server-Side Implementation:**
Server-side programming involves using the `ServerSocket` class in Java, which listens on a specified IP and port. Here’s the server-side code example:

```java
public class Server {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        ServerSocket ss = new ServerSocket(6666);
        System.out.println("server is running...");
        while (true) {
            Socket sock = ss.accept();
            System.out.println("connected from " + sock.getRemoteSocketAddress());
            new Thread(new Handler(sock)).start();
        }
    }
}

class Handler extends Thread {
    Socket sock;

    public Handler(Socket sock) {
        this.sock = sock;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        try (InputStream input = this.sock.getInputStream()) {
            try (OutputStream output = this.sock.getOutputStream()) {
                handle(input, output);
            }
        } catch (Exception e) {
            try {
                this.sock.close();
            } catch (IOException ioe) {
            }
            System.out.println("client disconnected.");
        }
    }

    private void handle(InputStream input, OutputStream output) throws IOException {
        var writer = new BufferedWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(output, StandardCharsets.UTF_8));
        var reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(input, StandardCharsets.UTF_8));
        writer.write("hello\n");
        writer.flush();
        for (;;) {
            String s = reader.readLine();
            if (s.equals("bye")) {
                writer.write("bye\n");
                writer.flush();
                break;
            }
            writer.write("ok: " + s + "\n");
            writer.flush();
        }
    }
}
```

**Client-Side Implementation:**
The client connects to the server using the `Socket` class, specifying the server’s IP address and port. The client-side code example is as follows:

```java
public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        Socket sock = new Socket("localhost", 6666);
        try (InputStream input = sock.getInputStream()) {
            try (OutputStream output = sock.getOutputStream()) {
                handle(input, output);
            }
        }
        sock.close();
        System.out.println("disconnected.");
    }

    private static void handle(InputStream input, OutputStream output) throws IOException {
        var writer = new BufferedWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(output, StandardCharsets.UTF_8));
        var reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(input, StandardCharsets.UTF_8));
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("[server] " + reader.readLine());
        for (;;) {
            System.out.print(">>> ");
            String s = scanner.nextLine();
            writer.write(s);
            writer.newLine();
            writer.flush();
            String resp = reader.readLine();
            System.out.println("<<< " + resp);
            if (resp.equals("bye")) {
                break;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Stream Communication in Sockets:**
Both server and client use the Socket instance for communication, with `InputStream` and `OutputStream` encapsulating the data flow in TCP, which is stream-based.

**Need for flush() Method:**
Data written to network streams isn’t sent immediately but is buffered. To ensure timely data transmission, `flush()` is called to forcibly send the buffered data over the network.

In summary, TCP programming in Java involves using the Socket model for communication, with the server listening on a specified port using `ServerSocket`, and the client connecting via `Socket`. Efficient management of connections, especially on the server side, can be achieved using threading or thread pools, with `flush()` ensuring prompt data dispatch.
