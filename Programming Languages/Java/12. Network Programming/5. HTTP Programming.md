**What is HTTP?**
HTTP is the foundational protocol used by the most widely used Web applications today. For example, when browsers access websites or mobile apps access backend servers, they all use the HTTP protocol.

HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol. It is a request-response protocol built on top of the TCP protocol.

Let's take a look at the HTTP request-response when a browser requests to access a website. When the browser wants to visit a website, a TCP connection is first established between the browser and the website server, which always uses port 80 and the encrypted port 443. Then, the browser sends an HTTP request to the server. Upon receiving this, the server returns an HTTP response that includes the HTML content of the webpage, allowing the browser to parse the HTML and display the webpage to the user. A complete HTTP request-response looks like this:

```ascii
            GET / HTTP/1.1
            Host: www.sina.com.cn
            User-Agent: Mozilla/5 MSIE
            Accept: */*                ┌────────┐
┌─────────┐ Accept-Language: zh-CN,en  │░░░░░░░░│
│O ░░░░░░░│───────────────────────────>├────────┤
├─────────┤<───────────────────────────│░░░░░░░░│
│         │ HTTP/1.1 200 OK            ├────────┤
│         │ Content-Type: text/html    │░░░░░░░░│
└─────────┘ Content-Length: 133251     └────────┘
  Browser   <!DOCTYPE html>              Server
            <html><body>
            <h1>Hello</h1>
            ...
```

The format of an HTTP request is fixed, consisting of the HTTP Header and the HTTP Body. The first line always includes the request method, path, and HTTP version, e.g., `GET / HTTP/1.1` indicates a GET request to the path `/` with HTTP version 1.1.

Each subsequent line follows the fixed Header: Value format, which is called the HTTP Header. The server uses certain specific headers to recognize client requests, such as:

- **Host:** Indicates the domain name because a server might host multiple websites, so it is necessary to use the Host to identify which website the request is intended for.
- **User-Agent:** Indicates the client's identity information; different browsers have different identifiers. The server uses the User-Agent to determine whether the client is IE, Chrome, Firefox, or a Python scraper.
- **Accept:** Indicates the HTTP response formats the client can handle; `*/*` means any format, `text/*` means any text, `image/png` means PNG format images.
- **Accept-Language:** Indicates the languages the client accepts, sorted by priority. The server uses this field to return a web page version in a specific language to the user.

If it is a GET request, the HTTP request only has an HTTP Header and no HTTP Body. If it is a POST request, then the HTTP request includes a Body, separated by an empty line. A typical POST request with a body looks like this:

```
POST /login HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 30

username=hello&password=123456
```
POST requests usually set the Content-Type to indicate the type of the Body and Content-Length to indicate the length of the Body so that the server can respond correctly based on the request's Header and Body.

Moreover, parameters for a GET request must be attached to the URL and encoded in URLEncode format, e.g., `http://www.example.com/?a=1&b=K%26R`, with parameters `a=1` and `b=K&R`. Due to URL length restrictions, GET request parameters cannot be too many, while POST request parameters have no length restrictions because they must be placed in the Body. Moreover, POST request parameters do not necessarily have to be URL-encoded; they can be encoded in any format as long as it is correctly set in the Content-Type. A common POST request sending JSON looks like this:

```
POST /login HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 38

{"username":"bob","password":"123456"}
```
An HTTP response also consists of a Header and a Body. A typical HTTP response looks like this:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 133251

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html><body>
<h1>Hello</h1>
...
```
The first line of the response always indicates the HTTP version, response code, and response description, e.g., `HTTP/1.1 200 OK` means the version is HTTP/1.1, the response code is 200, and the description is OK. The client relies only on the response code to determine if the HTTP response was successful. HTTP has fixed response codes:

- **1xx:** Indicates an informational response, such as 101, which means switching protocols, commonly seen in WebSocket connections.
- **2xx:** Indicates a successful response,

 such as 200, which means success, and 206, which means only partial content was sent.
- **3xx:** Indicates a redirection response, such as 301, which means permanent redirection, and 303, which means the client should resend the request via a specified path.
- **4xx:** Indicates an error response due to client issues, such as 400, which means the request was invalid due to reasons like Content-Type, and 404, which means the specified path does not exist.
- **5xx:** Indicates an error response due to server issues, such as 500, which means an internal server error, and 503, which means the server is temporarily unable to respond.

When the browser receives the first HTTP response, it parses the HTML and then sends a series of HTTP requests, such as a `GET /logo.jpg HTTP/1.1` request for an image. After responding to the image request, the server directly sends the binary content of the image to the browser:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: image/jpeg
Content-Length: 18391

????JFIFHH??XExifMM?i&??X?...(binary JPEG image)
```
Therefore, the server always passively receives a client's HTTP request and then responds to it. The client, according to its needs, sends several HTTP requests.

With the earliest HTTP/1.0 protocol, each time an HTTP request was sent, the client had to first create a new TCP connection, then close this TCP connection after receiving the server's response. Since establishing a TCP connection is relatively time-consuming, to improve efficiency, the HTTP/1.1 protocol allows for repeated sending and responding within a single TCP connection, greatly enhancing efficiency:

```
       ┌─────────┐
┌─────────┐        │░░░░░░░░░│
│O ░░░░░░░│        ├─────────┤
├─────────┤        │░░░░░░░░░│
│         │        ├─────────┤
│         │        │░░░░░░░░░│
└─────────┘        └─────────┘
     │      request 1       │
     │─────────────────────>│
     │      response 1      │
     │<─────────────────────│
     │      request 2       │
     │─────────────────────>│
     │      response 2      │
     │<─────────────────────│
     │      request 3       │
     │─────────────────────>│
     │      response 3      │
     │<─────────────────────│
     ▼                      ▼
```
Because the HTTP protocol is a request-response protocol, the client, after sending an HTTP request, must wait for the server's response before sending the next request. Thus, if a response is too slow, it can block subsequent requests.

Therefore, to further speed up the process, HTTP/2.0 allows the client to send multiple HTTP requests without having received a response. When the server returns a response, it does not necessarily do so in order; as long as both parties can identify which response corresponds to which request, they can achieve parallel sending and receiving:

```
       ┌─────────┐
┌─────────┐        │░░░░░░░░░│
│O ░░░░░░░│        ├─────────┤
├─────────┤        │░░░░░░░░░│
│         │        ├─────────┤
│         │        │░░░░░░░░░│
└─────────┘        └─────────┘
     │      request 1       │
     │─────────────────────>│
     │      request 2       │
     │─────────────────────>│
     │      response 1      │
     │<─────────────────────│
     │      request 3       │
     │─────────────────────>│
     │      response 3      │
     │<─────────────────────│
     │      response 2      │
     │<─────────────────────│
     ▼                      ▼
```
Clearly, HTTP/2.0 further improves efficiency.

**HTTP Programming**
Since HTTP involves both client and server sides, similar to TCP, we need programming for both client and server sides.

Since a browser is also a type of HTTP client, the behavior of client-side HTTP programming is essentially the same as that of a browser, i.e., sending an HTTP request, receiving a server response, and obtaining the response content. However, unlike a browser that further parses the response content and renders and displays it to the user, we use Java for HTTP client programming, which is limited to obtaining the response content.

Let's take a look at how Java uses HTTP client programming.

The Java standard library provides HTTP-based packages, but it's important to note that earlier JDK versions accessed HTTP through HttpURLConnection. Typical code is as follows:

```java
URL url = new URL("http://www.example.com/path/to/target?a=1&b=2");
HttpURLConnection conn = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();
conn.setRequestMethod("GET");
conn.setUseCaches(false);
conn.setConnectTimeout(5000); // Request timeout 5 seconds
// Set HTTP headers:
conn.setRequestProperty("Accept", "*/*");
conn.setRequestProperty("User-Agent", "Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 11; Windows NT 5.1)");
// Connect and send HTTP request:
conn.connect();
// Check if HTTP response is 200:
if (conn.getResponseCode() != 200) {
    throw new RuntimeException("bad response");
}
// Get all response Headers:
Map<String, List<String>> map = conn.getHeaderFields();
for (String key : map.keySet()) {
    System.out.println(key + ": " + map.get(key));
}
// Get response content:
InputStream input = conn.getInputStream();
...
```
The above code is relatively cumbersome to write and manually handle InputStream, making it troublesome to use.

Starting with Java 11, a new HttpClient was introduced, which uses a chain-call API to greatly simplify the handling of HTTP.

Let's take a look at how to use the new version of HttpClient. First, you need to create a global HttpClient instance because HttpClient internally uses a thread pool to optimize multiple HTTP connections, allowing for reuse:

```java
static HttpClient httpClient = HttpClient.newBuilder().build();
```
The code to use a GET request to obtain text content is as follows:

```java
import java.net.URI;
import java.net.http.*;
import java.net.http.HttpClient.Version;
import java.time.Duration;
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    // Global HttpClient:
    static HttpClient httpClient = HttpClient.newBuilder().build();

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        String url = "https://www.sina.com.cn/";
        HttpRequest request = HttpRequest.newBuilder(new URI(url))
            // Set Header:
            .header("User-Agent", "Java HttpClient").header("Accept", "*/*")
            // Set timeout:
            .timeout(Duration.ofSeconds(5))
            // Set version:
            .version(Version.HTTP_2).build();
        HttpResponse<String> response = httpClient.send(request, HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString());
        // HTTP allows duplicate Headers, so a Header can correspond to multiple Values:
        Map<String, List<String>> headers = response.headers().map();
        for (String header : headers.keySet()) {
            System.out.println(header + ": " + headers.get(header).get(0));
        }
        System.out.println(response.body().substring(0, 1024) + "...");
    }
}
```
If we need to obtain binary content such as images, we just need to switch `HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString()` to `HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofByteArray()` to obtain an `HttpResponse<byte[]>` object. If the response content is very large and we do not want to load it all into memory at once, we can use HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofInputStream() to obtain an InputStream.

To use a POST request, we need to prepare the Body data to be sent and correctly set the Content-Type:

```java
String url = "http://www.example.com/login";
String body = "username=bob&password=123456";
HttpRequest request = HttpRequest.newBuilder(new URI(url))
    // Set Header:
    .header("Accept", "*/*")
    .header("Content-Type", "application/x-www-form-urlencoded")
    // Set timeout:
    .timeout(Duration.ofSeconds(5))
    // Set version:
    .version(Version.HTTP_2)
    // Use POST and set Body:
    .POST(BodyPublishers.ofString(body, StandardCharsets.UTF_8)).build();
HttpResponse<String> response = httpClient.send(request, HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString());
String s = response.body();
```
