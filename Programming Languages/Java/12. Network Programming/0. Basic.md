Check [[1. Concept]]

A computer network connects two or more computers so they can communicate directly, adhering to a common network protocol.

**What is the Internet?**  
The Internet is a network of networks, connecting various computer networks worldwide, each possibly using different network protocols. To integrate these networks into the Internet, the TCP/IP protocol suite is used.

**TCP/IP Protocol**  
TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol, which are the core protocols of the Internet. Only devices using TCP/IP can connect to the Internet. Other protocols like NetBIOS or AppleTalk are not compatible with Internet connectivity.

**IP Address**  
An IP address uniquely identifies a network interface on the Internet. A device connected to the Internet has at least one IP address but may have more.

- **IPv4** addresses use 32 bits, resembling `101.202.99.12`.
- **IPv6** addresses use 128 bits, resembling `2001:0DA8:100A:0000:0000:1020:F2F3:1428`.

There are public IP addresses, directly accessible, and private IP addresses, only accessible within a local network. Special addresses like `127.0.0.1` refer to the local machine.

**Networking Model**  
Due to the complexity of computer networking, a layered model like OSI (Open System Interconnection) is used to organize network functions. The OSI model has several layers, each responsible for different aspects of network communication. However, the Internet primarily uses the TCP/IP model, which roughly aligns with OSI but is simplified to four layers:

1. **Application Layer:** Handles high-level protocols, user interactions, and data encoding.
2. **Transport Layer:** Manages end-to-end communication, ensuring data integrity and order.
3. **Internet Layer (IP Layer):** Facilitates logical addressing and routing of packets.
4. **Link Layer (Network Interface Layer):** Deals with physical network connections and hardware addressing.

**Common Protocols**  
- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):** Provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of bytes over the network.
- **UDP (User Datagram Protocol):** Offers a connectionless dispatch of datagrams but doesnâ€™t guarantee delivery or order, suitable for applications where speed is crucial and errors can be tolerated, like streaming.

**Domain Names and DNS**  
Since IP addresses are difficult to remember, domain names are used. The Domain Name System (DNS) translates these domain names into IP addresses.
