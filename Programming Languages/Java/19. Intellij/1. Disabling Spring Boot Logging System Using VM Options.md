### Issue

When running a Spring Boot application or pulling another program, you might encounter the following error:

```text
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/slf4j/impl/StaticLoggerBinder
```

This issue may arise even when all Maven dependencies are correctly configured, and the required JAR files are present. The root cause is often a conflict between **Spring Boot's embedded logging system** and the external **SLF4J** library.

To address this, you can disable Spring Boot's default logging system.

### Solution

Disable Spring Boot's logging system by adding the following JVM option:

```text
-Dorg.springframework.boot.logging.LoggingSystem=none
```

### Explanation

1. **`-D` Prefix**: Sets a system property for the JVM.
2. **Property Name**: `org.springframework.boot.logging.LoggingSystem` - Configures the logging system used by Spring Boot.
3. **Value**: Setting the value to `none` disables Spring Boot's automatic logging configuration.

### Use Cases

- **Custom Logging**: To fully control the logging setup outside of Spring Boot.
- **Debugging/Testing**: To reduce unnecessary log output during development or troubleshooting.
- **Performance Optimization**: For scenarios where logging is not required, improving resource utilization.

### Steps for IntelliJ Integration

To apply this fix in IntelliJ:

1. Open **Run/Debug Configurations**.
2. Locate the **VM Options** field.
3. Add the following line:
    
    ```text
    -Dorg.springframework.boot.logging.LoggingSystem=none
    ```

### Effect

- **No Automatic Logging**: Spring Boot will not initialize or configure any logging system.
- **Custom Setup Required**: If logging is still needed, ensure an alternative logging framework or manual configuration is in place.

This solution is particularly useful when fine-tuning application behavior for **specialized environments**, **development**, or **testing**.

By following this guide, you can resolve the SLF4J logging conflict and customize logging behavior for your Spring Boot application effectively.
