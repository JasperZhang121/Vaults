In IntelliJ IDEA, after using **Ctrl + Click** (or **Command + Click** on macOS) to navigate to a method or class, you can quickly go back to the previous location using the following methods:

### Keyboard Shortcut

1. **Windows/Linux**: Press **Ctrl + Alt + Left Arrow**.
2. **macOS**: Press **Command + Option + Left Arrow**.

This navigates you back to the previous location in the editor history.

### Toolbar Option

- On the toolbar or in the navigation menu, use:
    - **Navigate > Back**.

### Using the Mouse

- Right-click in the editor and select **Back** from the context menu.

### Additional Navigation Shortcuts

- **Ctrl + Alt + Right Arrow** (or **Command + Option + Right Arrow** on macOS) to move **forward** in the navigation history.
- View navigation history:
    - **Ctrl + E** (Windows/Linux) or **Command + E** (macOS) to see a list of recently opened files and navigate directly to the desired one.

### Tabs

In IntelliJ IDEA, when you open multiple files, they appear as tabs in the editor. The default behavior for ordering these tabs in the tab bar is determined by IntelliJ's **Editor Tab** settings and user interactions. Hereâ€™s how the ordering typically works:

### Default Ordering Behavior

1. **Files Open in Sequence**:
    
    - Tabs are arranged in the order in which you open the files. New tabs are added to the rightmost position of the tab bar.
2. **Active Tab Focus**:
    
    - When you switch to an existing tab, it does not reorder the tab bar by default. The tab remains in its original position unless explicitly rearranged.
3. **Tab Pinning**:
    
    - If you pin a tab, it stays on the leftmost side of the tab bar, regardless of the opening order. This is useful for keeping certain files always accessible.

### Customizable Ordering Settings

You can configure the tab behavior in **Settings/Preferences**:

1. Go to **File > Settings > Editor > General > Editor Tabs** (or **Preferences > Editor > General > Editor Tabs** on macOS).
2. Adjust the following:
    - **Tab Closing Policy**:
        - Determines how many tabs remain open and which tabs are closed when the limit is reached (e.g., oldest, least recently used).
    - **Opening Policy**:
        - Decide if tabs should always open to the right or in some other order.
    - **Order Tabs by Usage**:
        - Enabling this will reorder tabs based on your recent activity (e.g., the most recently used tab moves to the left).

### Rearranging Tabs Manually

- Drag and drop tabs to reorder them in the tab bar.

### Quick Navigation Options

If the tab bar becomes crowded:

1. **Switch to File**: Press **Ctrl + E** (Windows/Linux) or **Command + E** (macOS) to see a list of recently opened files.
2. **Navigate to Class/File/Symbol**: Use **Ctrl + N** (Windows/Linux) or **Command + O** (macOS) to quickly jump to a specific class or file by name.
