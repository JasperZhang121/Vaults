When running code in **Run** vs. **Debug** mode, there are several key differences, primarily in terms of how the execution process is handled, the level of visibility into the program's behavior, and the available tools for diagnosing issues. Below is an academic-style summary of the key differences:

### Key Differences Between **Run** and **Debug** Modes

1. **Execution Behavior**:
    
    - **Run Mode**: The program is <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">executed from start to finish without any interruptions unless it encounters a runtime erro</mark>r. It follows the normal flow of execution, running at full speed, and terminates once the program reaches its natural end.
    - **Debug Mode**: The program is <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">executed step-by-step, with the ability to pause (breakpoints), step over or into code, and inspect variables and data structures at any point in the execution flow</mark>. This allows a deeper investigation of the program's behavior.
2. **Breakpoints**:
    
    - **Run Mode**: No breakpoints are used. The program runs continuously until completion or an error occurs.
    - **Debug Mode**: Developers can set breakpoints (specific points where the program execution will pause) to inspect the state of the program at those points. This helps in tracking the flow of execution and analyzing issues like logical errors, exceptions, or unexpected behavior.
3. **Performance**:
    
    - **Run Mode**: Typically faster since no additional processes (such as pausing or stepping through the code) are involved. The program runs to completion without interference.
    - **Debug Mode**: Slower due to the extra overhead introduced by the debugger, such as pausing the program, stepping through lines of code, and evaluating expressions. It also typically uses more system resources (memory and CPU).
4. **Tooling and Insights**:
    
    - **Run Mode**: You don’t have access to advanced debugging features such as variable inspection, stack traces, or call stack monitoring while the program is running.
    - **Debug Mode**: Provides a wealth of debugging tools, such as:
        - **Variable Watch**: Viewing the current values of variables in real-time.
        - **Call Stack**: Monitoring the chain of function calls leading up to the current point.
        - **Step Execution**: The ability to execute one line of code at a time, which helps to isolate problematic code sections.
        - **Exception Handling**: Monitoring exceptions and their call stack context for better error resolution.
5. **Error Detection**:
    
    - **Run Mode**: Errors are typically detected only when the program executes that specific part of the code. These may include runtime errors such as division by zero, null pointer exceptions, or other issues that cause crashes or unexpected behavior.
    - **Debug Mode**: Errors can be detected earlier by stopping execution at specific breakpoints, allowing inspection of variables, control flow, and logic before the error occurs. This proactive approach aids in identifying bugs early in the development cycle.
6. **Output and Logs**:
    
    - **Run Mode**: Output is often displayed in the console or logged to a file without any intervention from the developer. The program’s output depends entirely on its design.
    - **Debug Mode**: The debugger often provides additional logs, such as detailed messages about variable states, breakpoints hit, stack traces, and control flow. This is especially useful for diagnosing complex issues in the code.
7. **Integration with IDE Features**:
    
    - **Run Mode**: The IDE will simply compile the code (if needed) and run it in the terminal or dedicated environment without providing additional support for debugging.
    - **Debug Mode**: Integrated debugging features within the IDE allow for advanced capabilities, such as pausing execution, inspecting variable values, modifying variables in runtime, and performing dynamic analysis.
