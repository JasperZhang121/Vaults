### Timing of Build and Run

The use cases and timing for **Build** and **Run** vary based on the project requirements and development stage. Here's a detailed explanation of **when to Build and when to Run**:

### **1. What are Build and Run?**

- **Build**: The process of compiling source code (e.g., `.java`) into executable files (e.g., `.class`), handling resources, dependencies, optimization, and packaging. It is typically used to generate executable programs or deployment files (e.g., `.jar`, `.war`).
    
- **Run**: The execution of compiled code, either to run the application or to debug it directly.

### **2. When to Build?**

#### **Scenarios requiring Build during development:**

1. **When the project structure or configuration files are modified**:
    
    - Adding new modules, classes, or configuration files (e.g., `application.properties`).
    - Ensuring that all dependencies and resources are properly processed.
2. **When adding or updating dependencies**:
    
    - Introducing new libraries via Maven/Gradle or updating existing library versions.
    - Building is required to download the new dependencies and verify compatibility.
3. **When generating deployment files**:
    
    - Packaging the project into `.jar`, `.war`, or other deployable formats for server deployment or sharing.
4. **During integration or build environment testing**:
    
    - Ensuring the project runs in environments outside the local machine (e.g., CI/CD pipelines).

#### **Scenarios requiring Build during release:**

1. **For production deployment**:
    
    - Generating a stable and optimized production package during a new version release.
2. **Environment-specific configurations**:
    
    - Creating different configuration versions for development, testing, and production environments, e.g., using Maven Profiles.
3. **Creating a formal version**:
    
    - Finalizing the project by removing SNAPSHOT tags and assigning stable version numbers (e.g., `1.0.0`).

### **3. When to Run?**

#### **Scenarios requiring Run during development:**

1. **For debugging**:
    
    - Running the program to test functionality after writing new code.
    - Useful for minor changes like editing a method or logic.
2. **For quick functionality validation**:
    
    - Verifying small features without managing dependencies or resource files.
3. **When recompilation is unnecessary**:
    
    - Running previously compiled code after making non-structural changes (e.g., updating print statements or local logic).
4. **Using debugging tools in IDEs**:
    
    - Running in Debug mode via tools like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse for real-time debugging.

#### **Scenarios requiring Run during testing or operation:**

1. **Running local services**:
    
    - Starting a Spring Boot application (e.g., `mvn spring-boot:run`) to test APIs or app functionality.
2. **Executing scripts or tools**:
    
    - Running independent utility classes (e.g., `Main.java`) without a full Build process.
3. **Running unit tests**:
    
    - Executing test classes via IDE or command line to validate the logic.

### **4. Typical Development Workflow Combining Build and Run**

A common development workflow to decide when to Build or Run:

1. **Daily development**:
    
    - Write code and Run directly using an IDE.
    - Build first if dependencies or configurations are modified, then Run.
2. **Before committing code**:
    
    - Build the project locally and run all test cases to ensure correctness.
3. **During integration testing**:
    
    - Use CI/CD pipelines to Build the project and run tests.
    - Deploy to testing environments if tests pass.
4. **For production deployment**:
    
    - Build the production-ready `.jar`/`.war` file and deploy it to the server.

### **5. Relationship Between Build and Run**

|**Scenario**|**Action**|**Reason**|
|---|---|---|
|**Developing new features**|Run|Quickly test new features without packaging or optimization.|
|**Changing configuration or dependencies**|Build → Run|Ensure proper integration of changes before execution.|
|**Packaging for release**|Build|Generate a stable deployable file, e.g., `.jar` or `.war`.|
|**Debugging small changes**|Run|Faster execution without re-building the entire project.|
|**Integration testing**|Build → Run|Validate integration after ensuring all modules and dependencies align.|
|**Pre-release checks**|Build|Ensure consistency in production configurations and versioning.|

### **6. Summary**

- **Build ensures the integrity of code, resources, and dependencies**, suitable for large project changes or generating deployable versions.
- **Run enables quick validation and debugging of functionality**, ideal for testing small changes during development.

In short:

- **For small changes**: Run directly.
- **For dependency/configuration changes, large-scale updates, or deployment**: Build first.
