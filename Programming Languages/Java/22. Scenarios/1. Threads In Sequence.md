### 1.1 Key Concepts and Components  
  
#### **1.1.1 AtomicInteger**  
- `AtomicInteger` is used for thread-safe incrementing of the counter. It ensures atomicity and visibility across threads without requiring explicit synchronization for the counter.  
  
#### **1.1.2 Synchronization Mechanism**  
- The `synchronized` block ensures mutual exclusion, preventing both threads from modifying shared resources (`counter` and the lock object) simultaneously.  
  
#### **1.1.3 Lock Object**  
- A shared `Object` (`lock`) is used as a monitor to coordinate communication between threads using `wait()` and `notify()`.  
  
#### **1.1.4 `wait()` and `notify()`**  
- `wait()`: Causes the current thread to wait until it is notified by another thread.   
- `notify()`: Wakes up a single thread waiting on the object's monitor.  
  
---  
  
### 1.2 Program Workflow  
  
1. **Setup Counter and Lock**  
   - A static `AtomicInteger counter` is initialized to `0` to track the numbers to be printed.  
   - A static `Object lock` is created to serve as a synchronization monitor.  
  
2. **Define Runnable Task**  
   - A `Runnable` task is defined that will:  
     1. **Acquire the Lock**: Use `synchronized(lock)` to ensure thread-safe access.  
     2. **Notify the Other Thread**: Call `lock.notify()` to wake up the other thread waiting on the lock.  
     3. **Check Termination Condition**: If `counter > 200`, exit the loop and terminate the thread.  
     4. **Print the Counter**: Print the current counter value and increment it atomically using `counter.getAndIncrement()`.  
     5. **Wait for Notification**: Call `lock.wait()` to release the lock and wait for the other thread's signal.  
  
3. **Start Threads**  
   - Two threads (`Thread-1` and `Thread-2`) are created and started with the shared `Runnable` task.

### 1.3 Explanation of Core Sections  
  
#### **1.3.1 The Task Logic**  
```java  
Runnable task = () -> {
    while (true) {
        synchronized (lock) {
            lock.notify(); // Notify the other thread to proceed.
            if (counter.get() > 200) { // Check termination condition.
                break;
            }
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " prints " + counter.getAndIncrement());
            try {
                lock.wait(); // Wait for the other thread's notification.
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                throw new RuntimeException(e);
            }
        }
    }
};  
```  
- Threads alternate in acquiring the lock.  
- Each thread:  
  - Prints the current counter value.  
  - Notifies the other thread.  
  - Waits for the other thread's signal.  
  
#### **1.3.2 Starting Threads**  
```java  
new Thread(task, "Thread-1").start();  
new Thread(task, "Thread-2").start();  
```  
- Two threads are instantiated with the same `Runnable` task.  
- Their names (`Thread-1` and `Thread-2`) help identify which thread is printing the current value.  
  
---  
  
### 1.4 Execution Flow  
  
1. Thread-1 acquires the lock, prints `0`, and notifies Thread-2.  
2. Thread-1 releases the lock and waits.  
3. Thread-2 acquires the lock, prints `1`, and notifies Thread-1.  
4. Thread-2 releases the lock and waits.  
5. This process repeats until the counter exceeds `200`.  
  
---  
  
### 1.5 Termination Condition  
- The termination condition (`counter.get() > 200`) ensures both threads exit the loop when all numbers from `0` to `200` are printed.  
  
---  
  
### 1.6 Output Example  
The output alternates between the two threads, as shown below:  
```  
Thread-1 prints 0  
Thread-2 prints 1  
Thread-1 prints 2  
Thread-2 prints 3  
...  
Thread-1 prints 200  
```

### 1.7 Notes and Considerations  
1. **Thread Safety**: The use of `synchronized` ensures mutual exclusion and prevents race conditions.  
2. **Atomic Counter**: `AtomicInteger` simplifies atomic updates without explicit synchronization.  
3. **Efficient Communication**: `wait()` and `notify()` handle thread coordination effectively.

### 1.8 Extension  
  
How to use three threads to output values 0 to 200 in turn in sequence?  
  
#### **Key Concepts**  
1. **Thread Synchronization**:  
   - Threads use a shared `lock` object to coordinate their turns.  
   - The `synchronized` block ensures only one thread can execute the critical section at any time.  
  
2. **Thread Turn Management**:  
   - A shared `turn` variable determines which thread should proceed.  
   - The turn rotates among the three threads (values `1`, `2`, and `3`).  
  
3. **Termination Condition**:  
   - The shared counter is checked inside the synchronized block.  
   - If `counter > 200`, all threads are notified, and the current thread exits its loop.  
  
4. **Wait and Notify**:  
    - `lock.wait()` pauses a thread until it is signaled to proceed.  
    - `lock.notifyAll()` wakes up all waiting threads, ensuring no thread remains stuck indefinitely.  
  
---  
  
#### **Code Walkthrough**  
1. **Runnable Task**:  
   - Each thread runs a task that:  
      - Checks if it is the thread's turn to execute (`turn == threadNumber`).  
      - Waits (`lock.wait()`) if it is not its turn or if the counter has exceeded the limit.  
      - Prints the current value of the counter and increments it.  
      - Updates the `turn` to the next thread (`(turn % 3) + 1`).  
      - Calls `lock.notifyAll()` to wake up the other threads.  
  
2. **Termination Logic**:  
   - When the counter exceeds 200, the current thread calls `lock.notifyAll()` to wake up any waiting threads and exits the loop.  
  
3. **Thread Creation**:  
   - Three threads are created, each named "1", "2", and "3" to represent their turn numbers.  
   - The threads are started concurrently.

#### **Code**  
```java  
public static void threeThreads() {
    Runnable task = (Runnable & java.io.Serializable) () -> {
        int threadNumber = Integer.parseInt(Thread.currentThread().getName());
        while (true) {
            synchronized (lock) {
                // Wait until it's this thread's turn or the counter exceeds 200
                while (turn != threadNumber && counter.get() <= 200) {
                    try {
                        lock.wait();
                    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                        throw new RuntimeException(e);
                    }
                }

                // Exit if the counter exceeds 200
                if (counter.get() > 200) {
                    lock.notifyAll(); // Wake up all threads to let them exit
                    break;
                }

                // Print the current counter value
                System.out.println("Thread-" + threadNumber + " prints " + counter.getAndIncrement());

                // Set the turn to the next thread
                turn = (turn % 3) + 1;

                // Notify all waiting threads
                lock.notifyAll();
            }
        }
    };

    // Create and start three threads
    new Thread(task, "1").start();
    new Thread(task, "2").start();
    new Thread(task, "3").start();
}```

#### **Key Variables**  
- **`lock`**: A shared object used for synchronization.  
- **`turn`**: Determines which thread can execute its task. Values rotate between 1, 2, and 3.  
- **`counter`**: A shared atomic variable that stores the current value to be printed.  
  
---  
  
#### **Execution Flow**  
1. **Initialization**:  
   - Three threads are started, each running the same task.  
   - The `turn` variable ensures the threads execute in order.  
  
2. **Thread Execution**:  
   - Each thread checks if it’s their turn. If not, they wait.  
   - When it’s a thread’s turn, it prints the current counter value and increments the counter.  
  
3. **Termination**:  
   - When `counter > 200`, the thread notifies all waiting threads and exits.  
   - Other threads wake up, check the condition, and also exit.  
  
  
---  
  
#### **Notes**  
1. **Fair Scheduling**:  
   - The use of `turn` ensures each thread gets its turn in a round-robin fashion.  
  
2. **Thread-Safe Counter**:  
   - The `counter` variable is atomic to ensure thread-safe updates.  
  
3. **Scalability**:  
   - This method can be extended to support `n` threads by modifying the logic for `turn`.  
  
4. **Improvement**:  
   - Use `Thread.join()` in the `main` method to wait for all threads to complete before exiting the program.
