### Functions and the `main` Function

- Functions in Rust are declared using the `fn` keyword, followed by the function name and parentheses containing optional parameters.
- The `main` function is the entry point of a Rust program and is where the execution begins.
- The `main` function is defined as `fn main() { ... }` and contains the code to be executed when the program runs.

### Variable Declaration and Mutability

- Variables in Rust are declared using the `let` keyword, followed by the variable name and an optional type annotation.
- By default, variables in Rust are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed once assigned.
- To declare a mutable variable, use the `mut` keyword before the variable name.
- Mutable variables allow you to modify their values.

```rust
fn main() {
    // Variables and Mutability
    
    let mut x = 5; // variable x is mutable because of the keyword mut
    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
  
    x = 6;
    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);

    // Constants
    const MAX_POINTS: u32 = 100_000;

    // Shawdowing
    let y = 5;
    let y = y + 1;
    println!("The value of y is: {}", y);

    let z = "    ";
    let z = z.len(); // z is now a different type
    println!("The value of z is: {}", z);
}
```

### Printing Output with `println!` Macro

- The `println!` macro is used to print output to the console in a formatted manner.
- It starts with `println!` followed by parentheses `( )`, and inside the parentheses, you provide a format string followed by the values to be inserted into the placeholders.
- Placeholders are represented by curly braces `{}` within the format string, and the corresponding values are passed after the format string.

### Data Types and Type Annotations
Type Annotations:
- Rust is a statically-typed language, which means that every variable must have a declared type at compile time.
- Type annotations provide explicit information about the expected type of a variable.
- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Type annotations</mark> are added to variables using the colon `:` followed by the desired type.
- Type annotations help the compiler perform type checking and ensure that variables are used correctly.
- When a type annotation is provided, the compiler can catch type errors early and enforce type safety.

Built-in Data Types: Rust provides several built-in data types that cover a wide range of common data representations:
- Integers: Integers represent whole numbers. Rust has both signed and unsigned integer types. The signed integer types are `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64`, and `i128`, representing 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, 64-bit, and 128-bit signed integers, respectively. The unsigned integer types are `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, and `u128`, representing 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, 64-bit, and 128-bit unsigned integers, respectively.
    
- Floating-Point Numbers: Floating-point numbers represent decimal numbers with a fractional component. Rust provides two types for floating-point numbers: `f32` and `f64`. `f32` is a 32-bit single-precision floating-point number, and `f64` is a 64-bit double-precision floating-point number. By default, Rust uses the `f64` type for floating-point numbers because it provides higher precision.
    
- Booleans: Booleans represent truth values. The boolean type in Rust is `bool`, which can have two possible values: `true` or `false`. Booleans are used for logical operations and conditional expressions.
    
- Characters: Characters represent individual Unicode scalar values. In Rust, the character type is `char`, and it is enclosed in single quotes (`'`). Rust's `char` type supports Unicode characters, allowing for internationalization and multilingual text processing.
    
- Strings: Strings represent a collection of characters. In Rust, strings are represented by the `String` type, which is a growable, heap-allocated string. String literals are represented by the `&str` type, which is a reference to a string slice. Rust provides various methods and functionalities for manipulating and working with strings.
    
- And more: Rust also provides other built-in data types such as arrays, slices, tuples, option types, and more, which enable more complex data structures and representations.

### Control Flow Statements

- Rust supports standard control flow statements like `if` expressions, `loop` loops, `while` loops, and `for` loops.
- `if` expressions are used for conditional branching, and the condition must be a boolean expression.
- `loop` creates an infinite loop that can be terminated using the `break` statement.
- `while` loops execute a block of code as long as the specified condition is true.
- `for` loops iterate over a range or collection of items.

```rust

    let condition: bool = true;
    let number: i32 = if condition { 5 } else { 6 }; // if-else is an expression, not a statement, so it can be used on the right side of a let statement.


    // loop
    let mut counter: i32 = 0;
    let result: i32 = loop {
        counter += 1;
        if counter == 10 {
            break counter * 2;
        }
    };
    println!("The result is {}", result);

    // while
    let mut number: i32 = 3;
    while number != 0 {
        println!("{}!", number);
        number -= 1;
    }
    println!("LIFTOFF!!!");


    // for
    let arr: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    for element in arr.iter() {
        println!("the value is: {}", element);
    }

    for num in (1..4).rev() {
        println!("{}!", num);
    }
    println!("LIFTOFF!!!")
```


### Error Handling with `Result` and `match`

- Rust emphasizes error handling through the `Result` enum and the `match` expression.
- Functions that can potentially fail return a `Result` type, which represents the possibility of success (`Ok`) or failure (`Err`).
- The `match` expression is used to handle different outcomes or errors returned by a `Result`.
- It allows pattern matching against different possible `Result` variants and executing corresponding code blocks.

These notes cover the basic syntax elements of Rust, including function declaration, variable declaration and mutability, printing output, data types, type annotations, control flow statements, and error handling using `Result` and `match`.

```rust
fn main() {
    // Variable Declaration and Mutability
    let immutable_var = 42;
    let mut mutable_var = String::from("Hello");

    // Printing Output with println! Macro
    println!("The value of immutable_var is: {}", immutable_var);
    println!("The value of mutable_var is: {}", mutable_var);

    // Data Types and Type Annotations
    let number: i32 = 10;
    let is_true: bool = true;
    let character: char = 'A';
    let greeting: &str = "Hello, world!";

    println!("Number: {}", number);
    println!("Boolean: {}", is_true);
    println!("Character: {}", character);
    println!("Greeting: {}", greeting);

    // Control Flow Statements
    if number > 5 {
        println!("Number is greater than 5");
    } else {
        println!("Number is less than or equal to 5");
    }

    let mut counter = 0;
    loop {
        counter += 1;
        println!("Counter: {}", counter);

        if counter >= 5 {
            break;
        }
    }

    let mut while_counter = 0;
    while while_counter < 3 {
        println!("While Counter: {}", while_counter);
        while_counter += 1;
    }

    for i in 0..3 {
        println!("For Loop Counter: {}", i);
    }

    // Error Handling with Result and match
    let result: Result<i32, &str> = Ok(42);

    match result {
        Ok(value) => println!("Result: {}", value),
        Err(error) => println!("Error: {}", error),
    }
}
```
