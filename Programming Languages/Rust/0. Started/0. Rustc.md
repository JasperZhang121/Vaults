To compile a Rust program, use the `rustc` command followed by the name of the Rust source file (`<file.rs>`). The `rustc` command is the Rust compiler and is responsible for translating Rust code into machine code that can be executed by the computer.

```
rustc <file.rs>
```

When execute this command, the Rust compiler will generate an executable file with the same name as the source file (e.g., if your source file is `example.rs`, the compiled executable will be named `example`).

The compiler may also generate additional files during the compilation process, such as object files or intermediate representation files. To execute the compiled Rust program, simply run the generated executable file in terminal or command prompt.

```
./example
```
