- Structs, short for "structures," are custom data types that allow you to create your own composite types in Rust.
- Structs enable you to define and group together multiple related fields into a single entity.
- Structs can have named fields, each with its own type, forming a blueprint for creating instances of that struct.

### Declaring and Defining Structs

- Structs are declared using the `struct` keyword, followed by the name of the struct and the list of fields inside curly braces `{ }`.
- The fields within the struct are defined with a name and a type, separated by a colon `:`.

### Creating Instances of Structs

- You can create instances of a struct, also known as struct instances or struct objects, by specifying the field values when initializing the struct.
- Struct instances are created using the struct's name followed by curly braces `{ }`, where each field is assigned a value using the field name and the corresponding value.

### Accessing Struct Fields

- Struct fields can be accessed using dot notation (`.`) followed by the field name.
- Field access allows you to retrieve or modify the value of a specific field within a struct instance.

### Associated Functions and Methods

- Structs can have associated functions and methods.
- Associated functions are defined using the `impl` block, similar to functions, but they don't take `self` as a parameter.
- Methods are associated functions that have access to the instance of the struct using the `self` parameter.
- Methods are defined within the `impl` block and allow struct instances to perform actions or modify their own data.

### Tuple Structs

- Tuple structs are similar to structs but do not have named fields.
- Instead, tuple structs use only the types of their fields to define their structure.
- Tuple structs are declared using the `struct` keyword, followed by the name and a list of field types inside parentheses `( )`.

### Unit Structs

- Unit structs are structs that do not have any fields.
- They are useful when you want to create a distinct type without storing any data.

### Visibility and Modules

- The visibility of structs and their fields can be controlled using the `pub` keyword.
- By default, structs and their fields are private to the module where they are defined.
- To make a struct or its fields accessible outside the module, use `pub` before the struct or field declaration.

```rust

struct User {
    username: String,
    email: String,
    sign_in_count: u64,
    active: bool,
}

fn main() {
    // tuple
    let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
    println!("The value of tup is: {:?}", tup);
    println!("{},{},{}", tup.0, tup.1, tup.2);

    // array
    let arr: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    println!("The value of arr is: {:?}", arr);
    println!("{},{},{},{},{}", arr[0], arr[1], arr[2], arr[3], arr[4]);

    // struct
    let mut user1: User = User {
        username: String::from("user1"), // use string, so the ownership is belonged to the struct, if use &str, the lifetime of the struct must be shorter than the lifetime of the &str because the struct doesn't own the &str, so the &str will be invalid when the struct is invalid
        email: String::from("abc@abc.com"),
        sign_in_count: 1,
        active: true,
    }; // if the instance is mutable, the whole instance must be mutable

    user1.email = String::from("xyz@abc.com");

    let user2: User = User {
        username: String::from("user2"),
        email: String::from("jjj@abc.com"),
        ..user1 // struct update syntax
    };

    // tuple struct
    struct Color(i32, i32, i32);
    struct Point(i32, i32, i32);
    let black = Color(0, 0, 0);
    let origin = Point(0, 0, 0); // different types

    // unit-like struct
    struct UnitLikeStruct;
    let unit_like_struct = UnitLikeStruct; // no fields, behave like (), the unit type

    // struct ownership
    // explain: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch05-01-defining-structs.html#ownership-of-struct-data
}

fn build_user(email: String, username: String) -> User {
    User {
        email, // field init shorthand
        username,
        active: true,
        sign_in_count: 1,
    }
}
