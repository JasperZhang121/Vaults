## Exercise 5.1
>What is a null statement? When might you use a null statement?

```cpp
; // null statement
```

  
The null statement may be used as a placeholder when a statement is expected. For example:
```cpp
// read until we hit end-of-file or find an input equal to sought
while (cin >> s && s != sought)
    ; // null statement.
```

## Exercise 5.2
>What is a block? When might you might use a block?

A block is a (possibly empty) sequence of statements and declarations surrounded by a pair of curly braces.It's used when multiple statements are needed.For example:
```cpp
while (val <= 10)
{
    sum += val;
    ++val;
}
```

## Exercise 5.3
>Use the comma operator (ยง 4.10, p. 157) to rewrite the while loop from ยง 1.4.1 (p. 11)
so that it no longer requires a block.
Explain whether this rewrite improves or diminishes the readability of this code.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
int main()
{
    int sum = 0, val = 1;
    while (val <= 10)
        sum += val, ++val;
    return 0;
}
```

  
## Exercise 5.4
>Explain each of the following examples, and correct any problems you detect.
```
(a) while (string::iterator iter != s.end()) { /* . . . */ }
(b) while (bool status = find(word)) { /* . . . */ } if (!status) { /* . . . */ }
```

(a) Illegal declaration : `string::iterator iter != s.end()`
```cpp
//corrrected as:
std::string::iterator iter = s.begin();
while (iter != s.end()) { /* . . . */ }
```

(b) Variable `status` is only declared inside scope of while condition.
```cpp
//corrrected as:
bool status;
while (status = find(word)) { /* ... */ }
if (!status) { /* ... */ }
```
