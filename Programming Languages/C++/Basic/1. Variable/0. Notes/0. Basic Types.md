### How to Choose a Type

-   When it is clear that the value cannot be negative, use an unsigned type.
-   Use `int` for integer operations. In general, `long` is the same size as `int` and `short` often appears too small. Choose `long long` if the range exceeds `int`.
-   Do not use `char` or `bool` in arithmetic expressions.
-   Use `double` for floating point operations.


### Type Conversion

-   When a non-Boolean type is assigned to a Boolean type, the result is false if the initial value is 0 and true otherwise.
-   When a Boolean type is assigned to a non-Boolean type, the result is 0 if the initial value is false and 1 if the initial value is true.
