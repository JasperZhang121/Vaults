## Exercise 4.1
>What is the value returned by 5 + 10 * 20/2?

```
105
```

## Exercise 4.2
>Using Table 4.12 (p. 166), parenthesize the following expressions to
indicate the order in which the operands are grouped: 

```cpp
*(vec.begin())
(*(vec.begin())) + 1
```

## Exercise 4.4
>Parenthesize the following expression to show how it is evaluated.
Test your answer by compiling the expression (without parentheses)
and printing its result.

```cpp
12 / 3 * 4 + 5 * 15 + 24 % 4 / 2
// parenthesize
((12/3)*4) + (5*15) + ((24%4)/2)
// 16 + 75 + 0 = 91
// print: 91
```

## Exercise 4.5
>Determine the result of the following expressions.

```cpp
-30 * 3 + 21 / 5  // -90+4 = -86
-30 + 3 * 21 / 5  // -30+63/5 = -30+12 = -18
30 / 3 * 21 % 5   // 10*21%5 = 210%5 = 0
-30 / 3 * 21 % 4  // -10*21%4 = -210%4 = -2
```
  
## Exercise 4.6
>Write an expression to determine whether an int value is even or odd.

```cpp
 i & 0x1 // actaully i & 0001 works as well
```

## Exercise 4.7
>What does overflow mean? Show three expressions that will overflow.

```cpp
short svalue = 32767; ++svalue; // -32768
unsigned uivalue = 0; --uivalue;  // 4294967295
unsigned short usvalue = 65535; ++usvalue;  // 0
```


## Exercise 4.8
>Explain when operands are evaluated in the logical `AND`, logical `OR`, and equality operators.

```
The logical `AND` and `OR` operators always evaluate their left operand before the right. Moreover, the right operand is evaluated if and only if the left operand does not determine the result. This strategy is known as **short-circuit evaluation**.

- logical `AND` : the second operand is evaluated if and only if the left side is `true`.
- logical `OR`  : the second operand is evaluated if and only if the left side is `false`
- equality operators `==` : undefined.
```

## Exercise 4.9
>Explain the behavior of the condition in the following if:
```cpp
const char *cp = "Hello World";
if (cp && *cp)
```

```
cp is a pointer to `const char *`, and it's not a nullptr. true.

`*cp` is a const char: 'H', and it is explicit a nonzero value. true.

true && true -> true.
```

## Exercise 4.10
>Write the condition for a while loop that would read ints from
the standard input and stop when the value read is equal to 42.

```cpp
int i;
while(cin >> i && i != 42)
```

## Exercise 4.11
>Write an expression that tests four values, a, b, c, and d,
and ensures that a is greater than b, which is greater than c,
which is greater than d.

```cpp
a>b && b>c && c>d
```


## Exercise 4.13
>What are the values of i and d after each assignment?

```cpp
int i;   double d;
d = i = 3.5; // i = 3, d = 3.0
i = d = 3.5; // d = 3.5, i = 3
```

## Exercise 4.14
>Explain what happens in each of the if tests:
```cpp
if (42 = i)   // compile error: expression is not assignable
if (i = 42)   // true.
```

## Exercise 4.15
>The following assignment is illegal. Why? How would you correct it?
```cpp
double dval; int ival; int *pi;
dval = ival = pi = 0;
// pi is a pointer to int.
// can not assign to 'int' from type 'int *'
// correct it:
dval = ival = 0;
pi = 0;
```

## Exercise 4.16
>Although the following are legal,
they probably do not behave as the programmer expects. Why?
Rewrite the expressions as you think they should be.
```cpp
if (p = getPtr() != 0)
if (i = 1024)
// why? always true. use an assigment as a condition.
// correct it
if ((p=getPtr()) != 0)
if (i == 1024)
```


## Exercise 4.18
>What would happen if the while loop on page 148 that prints
the elements from a vector used the prefix increment operator?
```
It will print from the second element and dereference `v.end()` at last, which is a **UB**.
```



## Exercise 4.19
>Given that ptr points to an int, that vec is a `vector<int>,
and that ival is an int, explain the behavior of each of these expressions.
Which, if any, are likely to be incorrect? Why? How might each be corrected?


```cpp
ptr != 0 && *ptr++  // check ptr is not a nullptr, and then check the pointer value and move to next.
ival++ && ival // check ival, and then check ival+1 whether equal zero.
vec[ival++] <= vec[ival] // incorrect. It is an **undefined behavior.**
// correct:
vec[ival] <= vec[ival+1]
```


## Exercise 4.20
>Assuming that iter is a `vector<string>::iterator,``

indicate which, if any, of the following expressions are legal.
Explain the behavior of the legal expressions and
why those that arenâ€™t legal are in error.

```cpp
*iter++;  // return *iter, then ++iter.
(*iter)++;  // illegal, *iter is a string, cannot increment value.
*iter.empty() // illegal, iter should use '->' to indicate whether empty.
iter->empty();  // indicate the iter' value whether empty.
++*iter;        // illegal, string have not increment.
iter++->empty();  // return iter->empty(), then ++iter.
```

## Exercise 4.24
>Our program that distinguished between high pass, pass,
and fail depended on the fact that
the conditional operator is right associative.
Describe how that operator would be evaluated
if the operator were left associative.

if the operator were left associative.
```cpp
finalgrade = (grade > 90) ? "high pass" : (grade < 60) ? "fail" : "pass";
```
would same as :
```cpp
finalgrade = ((grade > 90) ? "high pass" : (grade < 60)) ? "fail" : "pass";
```
if `grade > 90`, first conditional operator's result is `high pass`. so the finalgrade is always fail.
It's contradictory obviously.
  
## Exercise 4.25
>What is the value of ~'q'<< 6 on a machine with 32-bit ints and 8 bit chars, that uses Latin-1 character set in which 'q' has the bit pattern 01110001?

First, the char type is promoted to int type, that is, 00000000 00000000 00000000 01110001, then inverted, and left shifted by 6 bits, the result is -7296.
