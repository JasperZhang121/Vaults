### Implicit Type Conversion

-   Integer values smaller than the `int` type are promoted to larger integer types.
-   Non-Boolean values are converted to Boolean in conditionals.
-   Initialization converts the initial value to the variable's type.
-   Arithmetic or relational operations with multiple types convert them to the same type.
-   Type conversion occurs during function calls.

#### Arithmetic Conversion

##### Integer Promotion

-   Commonly used types `char`, `bool`, and `short` are promoted to `int`, or `unsigned int` if `int` cannot contain the original value.
-   `wchar_t, char16_t, char32_t` are promoted to the smallest integer type `int, long, long long...` that can hold all possible values of the original type.



### Explicit Type Conversion (Try to avoid)

-   **static_cast**: Used for any well-defined type conversion that does not contain low-level const. `double slope = static_cast<double>(j);`
-   **dynamic_cast**: Supports runtime type identification.
-   **const_cast**: Only changes the underlying const property of the operand, usually used to remove const. `const char *pc; char *p = const_cast<char*>(pc)`
    
    > Only it can change the constant attribute.
    
-   **reinterpret_cast**: Usually provides a low-level reinterpretation of the bit pattern of the operand.

#### Old-style Type Conversion
