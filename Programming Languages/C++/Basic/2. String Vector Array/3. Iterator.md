- All standard library containers can use iterators.
- Like pointer types, iterators also provide indirect access to objects.

### Using iterators

- `vector<int>::iterator iter`.
- `auto b = v.begin();` returns an iterator pointing to the first element.
- `auto e = v.end();` returns an iterator pointing to the next (sentinel, after the end, one past the end) of the last element (off the end).
- If the container is empty, `begin()` and `end()` return the same iterator, which is the end iterator.
- Use the dereference character `*` to access the element pointed to by the iterator.
- Get in the habit of using iterators and `!=` (generic programming).
- **Container**: Can contain other objects; but all objects must be of the same type.
- **iterator (iterator)**: Each standard container has its own iterator. `C++` tends to traverse elements with iterators rather than subscripts.
- **const_iterator**: Only the elements in the container can be read and cannot be changed.
- **arrow operator**: dereference + member access, `it->mem` is equivalent to `(*it).mem`
- **Keep in mind**: But for any loop body that uses **iterator**, **do not** add elements to the container **to which the iterator belongs**.

Operators for standard container iterators:

| Operator | Explanation |
|-----|-----|
| `*iter` | returns a reference to the **element pointed to by the iterator `iter` |
| `iter->mem` | Equivalent to `(*iter).mem` |
| `++iter` | Let `iter` indicate the next element in the container |
| `--iter` | Let `iter` indicate the previous element in the container |
| `iter1 == iter2` | Determine whether two iterators are equal |

### Iterator operation

Operations supported by `vector` and `string` iterators:

| Operator | Explanation |
|-----|-----|
| `iter + n` | Adding an integer value to an iterator still results in an iterator whose new position is moved forward by a number of elements compared to the original. The result iterator indicates either an element within the container, or the next position of the tail element of the container. |
| `iter - n` | Subtracting an integer from an iterator still results in an iterator whose new position is moved backwards by a certain number of elements. The resulting iterator either points to an element within the container, or indicates the next position of the container's tail element. |
| `iter1 += n` | A compound assignment statement for iterator addition, assigning the result of adding n to `iter1` |
| `iter1 -= n` | compound assignment statement for iterator subtraction, assign `iter2` minus n to `iter1` |
| `iter1 - iter2` | The result of subtracting two iterators is the distance between them, that is, the iterator on the right of the operator is moved forward by the difference elements to get the iterator on the left. The two iterators participating in the operation must point to the elements in the same container or the next position of the tail element. |
| `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=` | Iterator relational operators, if an iterator |

- **difference_type**: Guaranteed to be large enough to store the distance between any two iterator objects, which can be positive or negative.
