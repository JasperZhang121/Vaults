| Operation | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `size()` | Returns the number of elements in the vector |
| `empty()` | Returns `true` if the vector is empty |
| `clear()` | Removes all elements from the vector |
| `push_back(x)` | Adds the element `x` to the end of the vector |
| `pop_back()` | Removes the last element from the vector |
| `insert(it, x)` | Inserts the element `x` at the position pointed to by the iterator `it` |
| `erase(it)` | Removes the element pointed to by the iterator `it` |
| `erase(start_it, end_it)` | Removes the elements in the range `[start_it, end_it)` |
| `front()` | Returns a reference to the first element in the vector |
| `back()` | Returns a reference to the last element in the vector |
| `at(i)` | Returns a reference to the element at index `i` |
| `operator[](i)` | Same as `at(i)` |
| `begin()` | Returns an iterator to the first element in the vector |
| `end()` | Returns an iterator one past the last element in the vector |
| `rbegin()` | Returns a reverse iterator to the last element in the vector |
| `rend()` | Returns a reverse iterator to one before the first element in the vector |
| `reserve(n)` | Allocates enough memory for `n` elements |
| `capacity()` | Returns the number of elements that can be stored in the currently allocated memory |
| `shrink_to_fit()` | Reduces the memory usage to fit the current number of elements |
| `swap(v)` | Swaps the contents of this vector with another vector `v` |
| `assign(n, x)` | Replaces the contents of the vector with `n` copies of element `x` |
| `assign(first_it, last_it)` | Replaces the contents of the vector with the elements in the range `[first_it, last_it)` |
| `resize(n)` | Resizes the vector to contain `n` elements |
| `resize(n, x)` | Resizes the vector to contain `n` copies of element `x` |
