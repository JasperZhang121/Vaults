### Introduction
In Scala, functions are treated as first-class citizens, which means they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions. This core feature underpins Scala's capacity for supporting functional programming, which emphasizes the use of functions to solve problems and manage data.

### Defining Functions
Functions in Scala are defined using the `def` keyword. This is followed by the function's name, a parameter list, an optional return type, and the body of the function. Here's a straightforward example:

```scala
def add(x: Int, y: Int): Int = x + y
```

This function definition syntax allows for clear and concise declarations of operations.

### Function Parameters
Scala enables functions to accept zero or more parameters, which are specified by their name followed by their type.

```scala
def printMessage(message: String): Unit = {
  println(message)
}
```

##### Default Parameters
Scala functions can specify default values for parameters. These defaults are used when no corresponding argument is supplied during the function call, providing flexibility in function usage.

```scala
def log(message: String, level: String = "INFO"): Unit = {
  println(s"[$level] $message")
}
```

#### Named Arguments
Scala allows functions to be called with arguments out of order by using named arguments. This feature enhances readability and flexibility in how functions are invoked.

```scala
log(level = "WARNING", message = "Something went wrong!")
```

### Higher-Order Functions
Higher-order functions are a cornerstone of functional programming in Scala. They can take functions as parameters, return functions, or do both, facilitating highly flexible and reusable code.

```scala
def applyOperation(a: Int, b: Int, operation: (Int, Int) => Int): Int = {
  operation(a, b)
}

val result = applyOperation(10, 20, (x, y) => x + y)
println(result)  // Output: 30
```

### Anonymous Functions
Scala supports the use of anonymous functions, also known as function literals. These are functions defined without a name and can be used immediately within expressions.

```scala
val multiply = (x: Int, y: Int) => x * y
println(multiply(5, 10))  // Output: 50
```

### Nested Functions
Scala permits the nesting of functions, where a function is defined within another. Nested functions can access the outer functionâ€™s variables, enhancing encapsulation and reusability.

```scala
def factorial(x: Int): Int = {
  def fact(x: Int, accumulator: Int): Int = {
    if (x <= 1) accumulator
    else fact(x - 1, x * accumulator)
  }
  fact(x, 1)
}
println(factorial(5))  // Output: 120
```

### Partially Applied Functions
Partially applied functions in Scala allow you to fix some of the function's arguments and leave the rest to be supplied later. This feature is useful for creating specific function variants without redundancy.

```scala
def add(a: Int, b: Int, c: Int) = a + b + c
val addFive = add(5, _: Int, _: Int)
println(addFive(10, 15))  // Output: 30
```
