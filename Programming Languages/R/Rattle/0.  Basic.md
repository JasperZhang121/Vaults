### Load data set

-   To run the example data set, simply click the Execute button.
-   To use your own data set, click on the filename icon and select a CSV file from your computer. Note that only CSV files can be selected, so ensure that your data is in the correct format.


### Explore the Data

-   To view the data, select all variables as input and click the view button.
-   To explore the data in more detail, click the Explore tab and select Summary, Describe, or Basics Box.
-   It is recommended to leave the partition box unchecked at this stage, as this step is only used for getting familiar with the data and does not relate to the training process.


### Meaning of Tabs:

-   Target: This is the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">variable that you want to predict</mark> using the other variables in the dataset. It is also sometimes referred to as the dependent variable or the response variable.
-   Risk: This is an optional variable that specifies the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">risk or cost associated with each observation in the dataset</mark>. For example, in a medical study, the risk variable might be the likelihood of developing a certain disease.
-   Ident: This is an optional variable that uniquely identifies each observation in the dataset. It is typically used in datasets where there are multiple observations per individual or entity, and you want to ensure that each observation is treated separately. For example, <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">in a medical study, a patient's identity may be uniquely identified by their name, date of birth, and social security number</mark>. In this case, you could choose all three variables as ident.
-   Ignore: This is an optional variable that you want to exclude from the analysis entirely. This can be useful for variables that are not relevant to the analysis or contain missing values.
-   Weight: This is an optional variable that assigns a weight to each observation in the dataset. It is typically used in datasets where certain observations are more important than others, and you want to ensure that the analysis gives more weight to those observations.

One thing to note is that it is important to ensure that the data is <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">preprocessed and cleaned before training the model</mark>. This includes handling <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">missing values, outliers, and encoding categorical variables appropriately</mark>. It is also important to split the data into training and testing sets to avoid overfitting the model to the training data. Additionally, it may be useful to perform feature selection or dimensionality reduction to improve the model's performance and reduce its complexity.
