### Load data set

-   To run the example data set, simply click the Execute button.
-   To use your own data set, click on the filename icon and select a CSV file from your computer. Note that only CSV files can be selected, so ensure that your data is in the correct format.


### Explore the Data

-   To view the data, select all variables as input and click the view button.
-   To explore the data in more detail, click the Explore tab and select Summary, Describe, or Basics Box.
-   It is recommended to leave the partition box unchecked at this stage, as this step is only used for getting familiar with the data and does not relate to the training process.


### Meaning of Tabs:

-   Target: This is the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">variable that you want to predict</mark> using the other variables in the dataset. It is also sometimes referred to as the dependent variable or the response variable.
-   Risk: This is an optional variable that specifies the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">risk or cost associated with each observation in the dataset</mark>. For example, in a medical study, the risk variable might be the likelihood of developing a certain disease.
-   Ident: This is an optional variable that uniquely identifies each observation in the dataset. It is typically used in datasets where there are multiple observations per individual or entity, and you want to ensure that each observation is treated separately. For example, <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">in a medical study, a patient's identity may be uniquely identified by their name, date of birth, and social security number</mark>. In this case, you could choose all three variables as ident.
-   Ignore: This is an optional variable that you want to exclude from the analysis entirely. This can be useful for variables that are not relevant to the analysis or contain missing values.
-   Weight: This is an optional variable that assigns a weight to each observation in the dataset. It is typically used in datasets where certain observations are more important than others, and you want to ensure that the analysis gives more weight to those observations.

One thing to note is that it is important to ensure that the data is <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">preprocessed and cleaned before training the model</mark>. This includes handling <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">missing values, outliers, and encoding categorical variables appropriately</mark>. It is also important to split the data into training and testing sets to avoid overfitting the model to the training data. Additionally, it may be useful to perform feature selection or dimensionality reduction to improve the model's performance and reduce its complexity.

### Transformation


#### Impute missing values
Imputation is a crucial process in data analysis, involving the task of filling in missing values within a dataset. To facilitate this process, Rattle offers a comprehensive set of tools and functions. Follow the steps below to effectively impute missing data using Rattle's Transform tab:

1. **Accessing Imputation Tools:** Navigate to the Transform tab within the Rattle interface. This tab houses tools and functionalities related to data transformations, including imputation.
    
2. **Selecting Imputation Methods:** Within the Transform tab, locate the options for <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">imputing missing values</mark>. Rattle provides various imputation methods to choose from. Experiment with different methods to determine the one that best suits your dataset and analysis goals.
    
3. **Applying Imputation:** Identify the variables containing missing values that require imputation. To apply imputation methods,<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;"> highlight one or more variables</mark> within your dataset. Use <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Shift-click or Ctrl-click</mark> to select multiple variables simultaneously.
    
4. **Executing Imputation:** Once the desired variables are highlighted, proceed to click on the "Execute" button. This step initiates the imputation process using the selected method(s) on the highlighted variables.

4. If you now go back to the Data page you will notice that Rattle has set the role of the <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">original variables you just transformed to Ignore</mark>, while the <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">newly generated variable has been set as an input variable</mark>.

#### Normalisation
Data normalization is a crucial preprocessing step in data analysis, aimed at transforming variables to a common scale. In Rattle, the process of normalization can be efficiently carried out using the following steps:

1. **Accessing the Transform Tab:** Launch Rattle and load your dataset. Navigate to the <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">"Transform" tab</mark>, which hosts various data transformation operations, including normalization.
    
2. **Selecting Variables for Normalization:** <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Identify the variables that require normalization</mark>. Typically, normalization is applied to numeric variables. Highlight the variables by using <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Shift-click or Ctrl-click to select multiple variables simultaneously</mark>.
    
3. **Choosing the Normalization Method:** Under the "Transform" tab, locate the Rescale options. Rattle offers various normalization methods, including Min-Max scaling, Z-score scaling, and more. Choose the appropriate method based on your data characteristics and analysis goals.
    
4. **Applying Normalization:** Once the desired variables are highlighted and the normalization method is chosen, proceed to click on the "Execute" button. This action triggers the normalization process on the selected variables.
    
5. **Reviewing Normalized Data:** After the normalization process is completed, review the transformed dataset to ensure that the chosen normalization method has been applied accurately. This step is essential to verify that the data has been scaled as intended.
